 Adaptive gradient method is an extension of the gradient descent optimization and which is allowing different learning rate for each and every weight when it is applying the back propagation method in the real world data set a few input features are sparse sparse in the sense most of the features will have values zero in the input data set . The same learning rate will not give you the good optimization that means it will not reach the convergence point faster so we need different learning rates .
