Music Hi everyone, I am your Shraddha didi and welcome to our college. In today s C tutorial, we have covered the entire C from basic to advanced, so after watching this video, you will learn coding programming and if there is an exam in your college in which C is asked, then you will be completely prepared for it. We have divided this tutorial into 11 chapters, below which you will be getting time stumps, so you can also individually.If you want to study any topic, then you can go and read that too and along with the chapters, we have included 100 questions in this video, out of which I have personally solved 70 questions in front of you and I have given 30 questions in homework for your practice. Along with the video, you will also get the link of all the codes or notes below so that once you finish the tutorial, you canYou can also come and do revision for free. Along with this, if there is any thing which you find important or you want to tell me, then you can tell me it by commenting below and in between, if you want to bookmark any lecture or any topic, then simply write its time below and comment on it. Next time we come, that comment will be visible on top. So, let s start our newest and biggest C tutorial by coding in C.First we will have to install two things inside our system, the first of which is our VS Code i.e. Code Editor. Now the code editor is like a notebook, like inside the notebook we are writing things in English and Hindi, similarly we write some code on our code editor and the name of the code editor we will use is VS Code. Now apart from this, you must have seen that in colleges and schools, some people are working on code blocks, some people are working on some other software.But here we are using VS Code because it is a very good software and in this you can not only do programming in C, after that if you want to do programming in C , Java or any other language, then for that also we will prepare and give you the complete atmosphere in such a way that you do not have to install anything else. So from the beginning, when we work on a good code editor, it has many benefits. The second thing that we will have to install is our compiler for which we will search for GCC.Now compiler is such a system, a software in which rules are written for our programming language. So there will be a C compiler in which all the rules of C language will be written. So whatever code you write, after writing your code, it will check whether you have written the code correctly and the compiler also does the work of running that code. So we will be reading about compilers in detail later. Now, first of all, install your code editor i.e. VS Code.So, to install VS Code, we first load VS Code for Wind on our screen. Now here first of all we will get the option that we want to download it for Vis. Next, now a list of check boxes will be coming to us and what we have to do is to tick all the check boxes. The above one says that if an icon is created for us on the desktop and the below one is giving us a lot of information about paths etc. then all the check boxes are ticked.And after that we will install it, then finally VS Code will be installed for us and we will click on Finish. Now after this we can go to the system and search for VS Code. After searching for VS Code, it will open and something like this will be displayed on the screen, inside which first of all we can choose a theme. It is our choice whether we choose a light theme or a dark theme, then we will go with dark, after that you will see the next section.If we want, we can also install Gut, but we will not work for Gut right now, we will not install it and mark it as done. Now inside VS Code, we have to open a new file inside which we can write things, then we can click on the new file and inside such files, we will be writing different different codes to the programs. Now here we have downloaded VS Code, but if you If you want to work on any other code editor, you have it already downloaded, then you can use that also. We will be doing the same code. The second thing that we will download is the C compiler. Now to download the C compiler, first of all we will have to write chromecast.com. We will be visible. We have to click on it, then the download will start for us. The first window that will appear is a popup. Above it are the installation directory entries, they will keep downloading, then a window will open in whichHe is asking us what other packages we have to download, then the check box that will come to us is for different different languages, what to do for now, if we download the basic for all, then in the install, we have to click on it, that is, we have to tick the check box for all, then go to the left, an installation option will come, we have to click on the installation option and then by clicking on Apply Changes, we have to download our packages for everyone, then these packages.It is possible that depending on your internet speed, the download may take some time, so you may have to wait a little for it. Now as soon as these packages are downloaded, we will get the message that all the changes are applied successfully, then we will close that thing. So now we have downloaded the code editor i.e. VS Code, we have downloaded the CK compiler and installed it, but one small thing is left, that is our environment variable, now environment.What is a variable or what exactly are we doing in this step, we will not go into the details of it, the basic thing is to understand that if you want to run the C code inside your system, then before that you will have to follow all these steps, for this, first of all, what we will do is we will go to the files in the system of our computer and in it we will be going to This PC. Inside this PC, we will search for MajiD.M.I.N.G. So after searching, the folder of MajiD.We have to go inside it, we have to go to the bin folder, then in the bin folder, when the entire path is being displayed above, when we click on it, then one of our paths will be highlighted, which is C drive sms bin, we have to copy the entire path of this because we are going to add it in the environment variable of our system, so we will copy it by right clicking, what do we have to do now, now we have to search inside our computer for the control panel.We will go inside the control panel, inside the systems we will be going in the advanced system settings. Now as soon as we go to the advanced system settings, we will see a popup on the screen, inside which we have to go to this environment variable option, then another environment variable option will be coming to us. Inside this option, below these environment variables, inside the system variable, we have to find the path. As soon as we find the path, we will not.If we have to go to the path, then as soon as our blue cursor comes on the path, we will edit it, then we are going to edit the path, in this we will edit a new path and inside the new path, we will copy the location inside which the bin folder of our Maji Dub is, we have copied that location, we have pasted it, then we will press enter, then we will press OK again KK and finally lastly OK, so in this way our variableInside the path variable, we have added the path to the bin of our manji. Now let s open the VS code and now what we are going to do is by doing a sample code, I am just going to run it and show you, inside which we do not understand how programming is done in C or how to run things or what is the meaning of whatever we are writing. We just want to see that as soon as we have set up our environment, any of our C code runs on it.After opening the file, I am going to write a sample code, then we are going to open a new file inside VS Code, first of all save that new file. Before doing world.con, there are some extensions in VS Code which we have to install so that VS Code can understand which code you are going to run and give you some additional functionalities for that. So below you will be getting the option of extensions. Now to run C, we have toc c extension of p It is a pack, we will have to install it inside our VS code. Once we have installed it, then we will go to the terminal above and open a new terminal. Now I am going to write some commands which are very complex. You are going to write very good advanced level C programs, so don t worry right now that these are going to be complicated, so I wrote some code. I wrote the commands below and as soon as I wrote the command, Hello World will be printed on my screen for me and you will notice that inside the above code also I have printed F.I have written one thing inside which I have written Hello World, so I have also written it in the code above, below it has also appeared in my screen, so our C code is working in this way, many separate videos have been made for it, so if you have any doubt in the installation, you can go and watch that particular video and many of the doubts in it will be getting cleared for you. Now to write our C code, we will first create a file. To create the file, above.We have to go to the file and click on Open. Now inside Open, we will have the option to open an old folder, but we are going to create a new folder which we will name as C Tutorials. We are going to open this C folder. Now we have an open folder. There is no file inside it, so first of all we will put a C file, like what we used to do, we used to make a practical file in school, in which we used to write all the things, similarly here we will create a file.We will create a file in which we are going to write all our code. To create a file, we will click on this icon and we will name our file Hello C. So this is our file. From here we close it. Now here we have named the file h.Given that, we can give any name to our file, maybe we want to write it as first program, then we can write first program S. This is Dr. S. This is called extension, like if we ever created a file on notepad, in the system of Viz, then we used to write it as abc.xyz. It is written as P .Now what we will do inside this file is that we will write a sample code of C. From this code, we will understand how easy it is to write C and it is not as big a thing as people tell us. Programming coding is a very easy thing. It is very easy. Inside this we will write some things which we will not understand right now but as soon as Chapter One is completed, all the things will become clear. So here we are going to write some things which maybe alien language.It may look like std add a int main print f hello world return row. Now here we have written hello world. Now this is the sort of convention that whatever new programming language you learn, the first code in it is the rule of the coding world that the first code you have to write is hello world, so we have written its code. The function of this code is that it will print hello world on the screen, so let s see how we save it and any C code.To run, we have to go up to the terminal and we will open a new terminal. In the new terminal, first of all write a line gcc h s. Here this GCC is our compiler of c. So we are evoking that compiler and after that we will write the name of our file. So basically what we are saying is that compile the code in the file in which we have written. This word compile is such a difficult word, isn t it, it will also be cleared by the end of chapter one, then the file.We have compiled it, now we will run it, how will we run the code, we will write add out this a. By default a file is created whose extension is dot out i.e. dot output. If we run it then it will print Hello World for us. Now the coders who are on Windows will have to write here a. a.exe because by default in Windows a.If we learn a little coding now, we will discover how much we can learn from it. We can make all the interesting things, so we have written our Hello World program inside it, what is main, what is include, why is hash written here, why is zero written here? We are going to understand the meaning of all these gradually. Now in our chapter one, we will read some basic concepts, after reading which we will start understanding programming. Inside this, we are going to read first of all, what are the keywords about variables, ourWhat are constants and how are comments written? What is the structure of the basic C program that we have just written and what we talked about about compilation? How is our code actually running on this machine and on this computer? We will read about all this only in our chapter one and will learn all the things. The first topic with which we are going to start is the definition of variable. If we talk about it, it is the name of.A memory location which stores some data. Now the name of the variable is memory location. Whenever we have to store something, we first need a place for it, like suppose we have to keep some shoes, then there are boxes for shoes, in any shop there are many shoes inside each box. Heels must be kept inside one box, slippers must be kept inside another box, so those slippers are heels, those are shoes, they are sports shoes, all that is our data.And we can call that box a container inside which our data is kept and if we give any name to the same container, then that name will be our variable. In the same way, when mother keeps many spices in the kitchen, suppose there is a box in which lentils are kept, there is a box in which turmeric is kept, there is a box in which salt is kept, then these containers contain our data inside them, that is, some of our food items, the outside container is called a variable, now this is the same.In this way, the computer also stores some data. Where does this data go and get stored? Suppose this is the memory of our computer and it has some boxes of its own and inside this memory, if we want to store the number 25, then we will store it in one of the boxes and we will give a name to that box, which is the name here.Location i.e. we will store it on a new box, we will name that memory location b and what will this b be called, this will be called our variable, so if we store anything inside the memory, then when we give a name to that memory location, we give a name to that box, we call it a variable. Now how to actually implement the variable, let s see by writing its code. We will be removing this line which is the entire code.This is our by default code, that is, we are going to write this every time, now we do not pay attention to it, now we have to pay attention to some parts in the middle, suppose we want to store the number 25, then we will write here int number is equal to 25, so because of this single line, our number 25 is stored in my, go inside that box and we have taken the name of that box here, number, similarly if we want to store any character, care star e.Equal to star, so inside our memory, we stored the star which is made on our keyboard in the memory and we gave the name of that container of that variable as star. In the same way, if we have to store the edge, then we will write int a e equal to 22, so here we have stored our edge 22 inside the memory and we have named that location as edge. What is this int here, what is this character, we will ignore it for now and pay attention.Just on this line, suppose we have to store any decimal value, then we will write float Pa 3.14, so our value of Pi is 3.14, this too has now been stored inside the memory and we have given the name of that container to that memory location, Pi, so in this way, we can store any number, any value inside our memory and we can remember the name of the container where it is stored, so we can call themNow there are some rules for writing variables in C. The first rule of these is ours. What is meant by saying that variable R is case sensitive? What is meant by saying case sensitive is that small a and big a will be different, which is our capital a and our small a, these will be different, we cannot consider them the same, like if we have to store a number as 30, then we can write int a 30, then 30 is stored inside the memory and we have given a as the name of the location where it is stored. Now we have to store another number, 40.If we write int a 40 then we get 40 stored at the second location and we named that location as capital a. Here this letter a and this capital a are two different variables and are not the same. The second rule that says about the variable in c says that the first character is alphabet and underscore. What does it mean that whatever is the first character in the name of the variable, it is either a normal English letter.It can be a character or it can be an underscore. Apart from this, there cannot be any other value, like if we had to store an edge, what did we write? Here we wrote int edge, we could have written it in this way also, int a 22, but we cannot write it like this, hein a 22 because here our red line will come and it will become wrong. If we want to write even one edge here, then it becomes red, that is, wrong, only any English character or underscore.Only this can come in the name of the variable. Our third rule says no comma and blank space, that is, there can be no comma and no blank space in the name of the variable, like if we want to store a final price, then we will write int final underscore price e e 1. Now this underscore is not the only special character that can come in the name of our variable. Suppose, instead of this underscore, we give a space here, then hereWe would have got an error because we cannot give a space in the name of the variable or if we had given a comma instead of a space, we would have also got an error because we cannot give a comma. We can use only one special character in a variable, which is the underscore, which brings us to the fourth rule. Which is no other symbol other than the underscore can be used. Now, one special thing about the variable is the value of the variable, isn t it?It is not fixed, it can change like we have defined our age variable because as of today our age is 22 but tomorrow i.e. after 2 years our age will be 24. When it gets updated then how will we write it as age equals 24. So earlier our age variable was 22 i.e. it was stored in the memory location but now after 2 years we have stored it in our age as 24. So in this way any variable can be written.If we can update the value of the variables, they keep changing inside our code and in fact the English meaning of variable is also something which keeps changing, so it all makes sense. Now whenever we write the variable, a special tip is given to every programmer which is being given by a senior programmer that the names of the variables should always be meaningful i.e. we should understand the variable as soon as we read it.Come, what is stored inside it, like here we have stored the age, we have given the name of the variable as age, if we have stored a star, then we have given its name as Star, if we have stored any random number, then we have given the name as a number, sometimes random, yes, we can keep the names like ABC because it is easy, but whenever we are writing a big program, there will be a lot of variables by doing ABC in it, that is why it is very important to give meaningful names there, so if you go ahead, you can keep names like ABC in your interviews.If we sit in companies for placements or if we are making our own project and do good level freelancing, then we have to write the names of our variables very well inside it, like if we had to store only 100, then we could have written only F here directly, but we wrote the full name Final Price so that it can be understood that 100 is a price. Now the next thing about which we will read after the variables is our data types. There are many data types inside C.We have given you a list of these different data types and all these slides will be available to you in the description box below, so there is no need to remember anything here, in fact we do not even have to remember all these, there are some such things which are useful while coding. If we will definitely remember, then all the things which are there remain in the mind. The data type is what type of data you are storing inside the memory and whatever type of data is there, it is specified for it that it will consume only that much memory, like whenever we buy a pen drive, it is written on it that it is 8GB pen drive or 16GB pen drive. In the same way, our character type data eats our one byte memory.If we talk about zero type data, it eats up our 2 byte memory. If we talk about float data, then it eats up our four byte memory. Now those students who are learning C after learning other languages will be a little surprised like me because they will come to know that in C there is neither Boolean type data type nor String type data type. Both of these do not exist in C because C came first i.e. C in 1970.After that, C came, after that Java came, after that JavaScript came, so C is our very old language, that is why there are many such things in it like objects and classes which are missing, so these are the concepts for which we have to learn other languages later, so out of all these data types, we will write down some of the important day data types and we have to remember only them right now.If it is not needed then let s remove all the already written things in our code and here we will talk about three data types. The first data type is our int. What does int store? Int stores the values i.e. the values which are our whole can be either positive or negative like 1 becomes 2 becomes 5 becomes 1 becomes 0. So ifIf we have to store an edge, then edge is our whole value, usually, we will store it in int data type, so here we will write int edge is equal to 22, so from this line we came to know three things, first of all, the data we are storing is 22, the memory location at which we have stored it, we have named it edge and the type of data is integer value. Now similarly, if we have to store the value of pi, then ourThere is no integer, so there are decimal values inside it, that is why we will store it in float data type, so here we will write float, then we will write pi and we will give its value as 3.14, so this is a number with decimal values, we have stored it in float data type, now apart from this, there is another data type whose name is character, so whatever are our special characters, like it is hashed, it is rated on M, it has become star, that is.At risk, we store all of them in character data type. For the character, we have to write care and here suppose we write our shag. So here first of all we have to write single quote to store the characters and inside we can write our character. So in this way we have stored a variable of care data type, we have done care of float, we have done it of int. For now, because we are working from the basic level, these three are the main ones.We need to remember the rest, we will keep learning more with time. Now the next topic which we will talk about is our constants. Earlier we had talked about what was the issue in the variable, the value of the variable could have changed. Now if whenever we create big softwares in big companies, like we created an admin panel, we created a website, what do we do for its testing purposes, we keep our own email password which isIt is fixed, the value of which we should not change. Every time we have to log in with the same email password, then what can we do. We can create an email variable inside a file, we can create a password variable and keep any value inside both of them. Those values inside C which always remain constant, those whose value does not change, we call them constants. There are three types of constants. The first of these are integer constants like our number one.The value of one is done. The value of one will always remain one. The value of one cannot be negative 1 or 0 or negative f. The value of one will always remain the same. If the constant remains fixed, then we have 1 2 3 0 1 2 The constants of this type are called integer constants. After that come our real constants, real constants, that is, those which contain real numbers like one 0, now 1.01 is also there but it is a real constant, to show that its Pt 0 extra has been written. In the same way, Pt 0 extra of 2 has been written if it is onlyIf it was two, then it would have become an integer constant. Now it is a real constant. 3.14. Here we should have got 2.4. Then it would have been a real constant. Now we have the third type of constant. Character constants are what come in the characters. All our alphabets come in upper case. In lower case, we have capital A. Special characters also come, like we have hash, we have M percent.Our Aest Risk has come or apart from this, our T Rate has come, then all the characters like this together form our character constants and one thing has to be noted here that the character constants are there, the value of this capital a will always remain capital a, it will not get slashed and whenever character constants have to be written inside the code, then we write them inside single codes, that is, whenever we write any character constant in the code, then it is there.Now we will have to put single codes. Now the next topic we will talk about is keywords. Like there are some words inside the dictionary. Every word has its own fixed meaning, it cannot be changed. Similarly, every programming language has its own dictionary. C also has its own dictionary in which some words are reserved, that is, they are fixed, their meaning will remain only the same, we cannot use it as a variable name.Neither should it be done in the same way. There are some reserved words inside C which have some special meaning and this meaning is known to the compiler. So there are 32 keywords inside C programming language and we have to pay special attention to these keywords. If we talk about the list of these 32, then our 32 keywords are something like this. In C, in this list, we must be seeing that int is our reserved word, our keyword is of C, so it means any.We cannot name the variable as int. Similarly, if we go to search for it, float is also one of our keywords. Apart from this, character is also one of our keywords and these are all the keywords. Now we will explore them somewhere in our entire course, then we will know which are the keywords. That s why whenever we see in our program, we have this int written, this int has a special meaning which is known only to the compiler.So, we should not name any variable as int. This is return. Return is also a keyword. We should not name any variable as return because these are special words whose meaning is fixed, which is known to the compiler. Now once we understand the structure of our program, how can we actually understand the code that we are writing? How can we actually understand how it is made? Just like the human body has a skeleton, similarly every code has a structure for every program.What happens is that if we talk about the structure of our C program, then our program looks something like this. This is our initial code which we have written. The first thing that is written in it is hash include. Then our angular brackets come and in the middle we have std add a. This is what we call our pre processor directive. Now what is a pre processor directive, we will read it later. For now, we have to understand that we always have to write this line inside our code, otherwise our C code is not running.After that, we always write this line, int main, after that our parentheses and then the curly braces and whatever part is written inside these curly braces, this is the code of our main. The execution of our program starts from the main function, that is, from this function, the function is a part of our code which does some work for us. We are also going to read about the functions in detail. Any C program is always started from the main function.The execution will start and that execution will be line by line, that is, if this line has come first, then it will be executed, then this line has come, then it will be executed after this. Our main function gets finished. Now you will notice that behind every line we write a semicolon inside the code, that is, a semicolon is written behind this line too. A semicolon is also written behind this line. This semicolon is like a full stop in our line. Just like we put a full stop in Hindi, we put a dot at the end in the English sentences i.e. we put a period. Similarly, we show a semicolon inside our C program by putting a semicolon here.But our line is over, now whatever is written next belongs to the next line. After this, we could have written the entire thing here also and we would have known that it is in the next line because it is coming after the semi colon and along with this, all the instructions of our code are case sensitive, that is, if we want to write int main here, then it would be wrong because all these have come in upper case because C is a case sensitive language.What is small will remain in small case, what is upper will remain in upper case, we cannot interchange or replace it, so whenever we create our C program, we always have to include a header file or our preprocessor directive at the top, after that we have to write int main and we have to put curly braces and in between we can write anything but at the end we always write a line with return zeros, it shows the row in the return row.If there are any errors in our code, it means that our code has been successfully executed. If there is no error in it, then we will always write this return zero at the end. Here is this part which we can change anytime anywhere in our code. Now the next topic about which we will read in this chapter is our comments. Like we keep giving some comments in life to people or we write something which is not a part of our code, it is some extra part.Comments can also be in English, some languages allow that we write our comments in different languages also, we can write comments in Chinese, we can write in Russian, so this is the part which is not included in the code, these are our extra instructions. Now comments are of two types. Inside C, the first ones are our single line comments which we write by putting double slash and after that we haveMultiple line comments which we write in this format. Now let s actually write comments in our code and see how they are written. Like inside this code we have told inside what data types are, so here we can write a comment by putting double slash. This code displays how data types work in C. So this is something which is written in English and is not a part of the code. Similarly, suppose we have to write comments in multiple lines, then we would write.These are slush ast risk and ast risk slash and in between we could have written anything. This is a multi line comment, so we are writing some things on our multiple lines and this is all part of the comment. Now if we remove this then this is an English thing, it will give us an error because it is not actually understood by C. The compiler is not able to understand what it means. What is this actually written?That is why that part which did not make sense for the compiler, we always write it in the comments, like in big companies, whenever you start writing code, the code becomes so many thousands of lines of code that it becomes difficult to understand, that is why to help other programmers, we write comments inside our code to tell them which part of the code performs what function. Now the next topic which we will study is the output whenever weInput output is a very essential part of programming. First of all we will learn how to show the output in C. After that we will learn how we take input in C. So to show the output, we just wrote a statement in C, that is print F and after that we put it. We write inside the parentheses, double quotes and inside the double quotes we can write anything. We had written on Hello World, here we can write, Hello Shraddha, here we can write.Hello our college, here we can write Hello C, anything can be written inside these double codes and which Whatever we write, it will be printed on the screen and the responsibility of getting this print printed is written by a function named Print F. Print F gets anything printed for us on the screen and at the end of this line, we will put semicolon to show that the line ends here. If you see its example, inside our code we can write print F here and in it we can write hello C. Let s save it as above.Let s blow away the extra space and run your code. Open the terminal and GCC Hello C will come up and Hello C is printed for us. Now suppose we have to print Hello C again and again. How to print it? Copy this line, paste paste paste. So we have printed Hello C four times. Save it and will run it again here. Now we have Hello C printed. Immediately after that Hello C is printed again in the same manner, it is printed four times.We wanted that if the next line is printed in the next next line, then that next line is always there. Here we have to write one thing, the special thing which is our base n. This base n shows that whatever we had to print in print f will be printed, after that a next line will come. We write the same thing here as base n. Even after this, the next line is needed, after this also the next line is needed and even after this, if the next line is needed then we save it.Now we will run it again here, now our output has gone to the next line. What actually happened is that it printed Hello C, then Hello C got printed, after that we printed BaSn, then backSlaA, i.e. next line, so we came here, then again HelloC was printed, then again BaSn, then we came to the next line. In the same way, whenever we have to bring the output to the next line, we write BaSn. Now let s assume that we have written aWe have created a variable inside our code, like if we have written int a e equal to 22 and we want to print this edge, how to print this edge on our screen, then for this we will have to write print f edge is, do we write edge, once we see the output of this thing, edge is edge, then whatever we have written inside the double quotes, we call it a string, that is, this thing will be printed as it is, but we have to print the number inside its edge.If we want to get the output printed, there are some cases that come up in the process of printing the output. The first case is that whenever we want to print an integer, we have to write it in our print statement. First of all, the sign of percentage and D. This D shows the double value. Double is also a data type. We will be reading about it later. So, sign of percentage and D and after that, as soon as the line ends, we will write comma and then we will write ourThe value of the variable will be printed whenever the whole thing is printed and in place of this percentage d, the value of our edge will come which will replace it. In the same way, if we want to get it done for real numbers, then we will write percentage f and then we will write the variable, then the value of this variable will replace this percentage f. Whenever the output is printed, if we want to get the output printed for characters, then we will write percentage c and then we will writeOur variable will replace this percentage c here. So in this way, whenever we have to print any variable whose data type is some and whose data type is some, then for that we write percentage d in integer type, percentage f is written in real numbers and percentage s is written in characters and actually inside c we call these three as format. We specify in which format the output will come to us.And this print F function is actually our library function which is already served to us in C by default, so once we see the cases of these outputs, after executing them, now if we have to write edge, then we know that here we have to write percentage D, here we have to put comma and here we will write edge, save it and open our terminal, now we have got edge printed, edge is 22, here this isThe percentage sign is coming because we have not given the next line, so if we save it and give the next line. Now we have edge is 22. Now in a similar way, if instead of edge we have to print the value of pi, then we will write float pa 3.14 and here we will write percentage f and here we will write pi. Let s save it, so now we have printed edge is 3.14. So by default there are some numbers of decimals inside the float which are always to be printed, so we have printed them here. Now you must be thinking that.How is the execution key of this statement coming again and again? So, on your keyboard, you have the arrow keys. You can press the upper key, then you can go to the old commands. So, you will not have to write the entire statement again and again to execute it. You can directly execute it by pressing that key. Now in a similar way, if we want to print a character, suppose we have created a character, a star, which is of the star variable.Name is and Asteris has been stored inside it, then we will write here Star is, Percentage C will come here and Star will come here, we save it and run it, the output comes to us as Stars Ast disk, so in this way we can get our different types of data printed on our screen. Now the next concept which is a very important concept of this language is our input. To take the input inside C, we use a function.Which is another library function whose name is scan f. Just like we used it to print print f, similarly we will use it to scan anything to take input. Scan f. Now its format is that whatever value we have to take input, first of all we will write its type, then we will specify the format. Percentage D shows us that we are going to take input of an int type value, then first of all we will put our quotes. Double quotes inside it, specify our format, comma, after comma we have toWe have to write that we have understood the type of the value that we are taking as input, now in which variable we have to store it, then we will write the name of our variable and before the name of that variable, we will put M percent. This M percent i.e. end is actually an address. This is the address of this variable, i.e. what will it do? Inside the memory, where a block of memory has been given to the edge, it will go to that address and whatever input comes to us, it will be sent to that address.After going and storing it, the work of scanf is something like this. Now what do we do by inputting a number and let s see how it actually scans. Scan F is a number. We make it a variable edge. Now we will write here print F. Enter edge. Now let s scan this variable. Scan F to percentage D. Address edge. And whatever value we get stored there, we will get it printed i.e. again percentage D. Before this we write edge.Let s save this, now go up and open our terminal. First of all, we have to enter our edge. We have printed 22. Edge is 22, so whatever edge we had entered has come back to us in print. Here, what scanf did was to enter the edge and go to whatever location in the memory the edge variable was pointing to. We stored that edge, stored that number 22 and when print FWhen we asked for that number back, after that it got printed as edge is and here it showed that the value of int type has to be printed and then we took out the data from inside edge and showed it on our screen, this is how our input output works. Now here we are going to make a small program inside C. What we will do in this small program is take the input of a number A, take the input of a number B and we will output the sum of these two, that is, we are going to write a small code. For this code, first of all,After creating the numbers, we create int a and b, now first print f, enter a, after that we will scan a, d and a, after that we will print f, enter b, then take it from scanf, input end b, now we will store the sum of these two in a third variable i.e. int sum e e a b, so here too, plus minus multiply divide. Reminder, all these work like math, so there is a plus sign for plus and for minus.There is a minus sign and what does it equal to two? It will calculate the value of both of them and put it inside the sum. It is equal to two which is this. Assignment operator is called plus, we use it as an addition operator. We will discuss about these operators in different ways, whatever they are inside C. Later, we will be discussing in details. So this sum which has come to us, now we will print it. Print F to sum is percentage d. Sum. Let s save this code. What did we do inside it? We created two variables a and b. First of all, enter a, then we got a entered and we used it as the name of that variable.Stored it in the memory location, after that b was entered. It was stored in the memory location of b. After that, a new variable called sum was created inside which the final value obtained by adding a and b was stored. After that, we printed the value of the sum. Now open our terminal and analyze its output. First of all, we will enter the value of a, then enter two, then enter the value of b.If there is five, then we have the sum in the output is seven. In this way, two and five are summed and then seven is printed. Now here we are going to learn a small trick. Here we have created a third variable sum, so we remove it and what we will do directly is by removing this sum, we will write here a b and save it and run our code once again. 2 5. So directly we have seven, which is our sum. If it gets printed thenWe did not need to create a third variable. Whenever we had to print the sum, if we had to print the difference here, then we could have written minus instead of plus. If we had to print the product of both, then we could have multiplied them by doing asterisks. In this way, whatever value has to be printed, we can do operations on it directly and we can write it here. Now we have learned a lot of things in C and how to run all these things.We wrote these in a file and from that file the output started coming to us. Now we call this entire process as compilation. Let us understand this process as to what actually happens. The definition of compilation is that it is a computer program that translates C code into machine code. So a compiler is a program that writes C code and translates it into machine code, like if a foreign guest has come to our Parliament.So there are translators in between. If the Prime Minister of French comes, there will be a translator in the middle who will understand his French and will convey it to the Prime Minister i.e. the Indian Prime Minister. In the same way, there are translators for languages inside our computers. The computer as it is, does not understand C. Our Windows machine is a Mac machine, it is linux.com. There was a file with C in it. We sent it to the compiler and what did the C compiler do? First of all, it will check that the file is C which defines the rules.Is it following all the syntax defined by it? Is there any mistake in it? Is there any error in it? Our variable name has not been started with a number, we have only put an underscore in the beginning, so it checks the basic errors of this method and if there are errors, then it fails the compilation. But if our file gets compiled, it means there are no syntax errors in it and after that itThe compiler converts it into windows.exe file and you can create dsi in linux.com and dot out in viz too, but by default the extension you are seeing will be this extension inside your machine, so there is no need to worry. If you are seeing dot out on my screen and you are seeing dotsy on your screen, then now we have understood the basic basic concepts of C and till now we have got some idea.Is it actually programming, then in this we will solve two such questions which if you are studying in college then usually from basic, if you are asked any easy level questions then they will look like this. The first practice question which we will solve is Write a program to calculate area of a square, so we have to calculate the area of the square, we have the side, we have given, we know math, we have studied in small class.What is the area of a square? Side multiplied by side. So what we will do is create a program that We will take input to the front side and then give output to the area. Let s try this thing inside our code. Let s write a comment on the area of the square. First of all, we will define a variable on the side. After that we will print F. Enter the side. Now take it from scan F. As the input, we will write percentage D. End side. Now we can print the area is percentage D. Side into side. Save it and open your terminal and run it on our side. We enter four.Our area is 16 of the square because 4 4 e 16. Now here it is not necessary that our side should be an integer, it can also be our float value. If the side is our float value, then in this case here percentage f will come instead of percentage d. Here also percentage f will come because if two floats are multiplied then a float value is produced. We will save it and run it again. So now if the side weEnter four, we will get the area is 16.00, so it automatically converted four into float internally. Now the next practice question which we are going to do says write a program to calculate area of a circle. It is written here on the side that we have given the radius of the circle and we know the area of a circle. We have Pa r s, so we know the value of Pa.There is a constant of 3.14 and if we multiply it by r, then in this way we will get the area of a circle. For this, let us change the program a bit or write the float radius and write here enter radius. Now whatever value we will enter, now whatever value we will enter, we will store it in the radius variable. Now we will write area is pi i.e. 3.14 multiplied by radius multiplied by radius because we have to takeWe square the radius and save it. Here we defined the variable, after that we wrote it with print F. We entered the radius on the screen, then we stored the radius, then we stored the area. How to store the area? We multiplied 3.14 with the radius and again multiplied it with the radius. We run it in the terminal. If we enter radius in the terminal, then we get the output that the area of the circle is 28.2.600 So in this way we can solve these questions, whatever we have read in this chapter till now, now our chapter one is over, here we have completed all the basic concepts of our chapter one i.e. C very successfully. By using all these concepts, there are such questions which are sometimes asked in your mid semester or end semester exam like this can happenConversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius can be given. Conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit can be given or we have formulas to calculate simple interest. We can tell you to apply this formula or here like we have calculated the radius, from the radius we have calculated the area, from the radius we have calculated the area, in the same way we can call it the area of a rectangle, we can call it the area of a triangle or it can be called compound interest. If you want to calculate, then basically you will learn the basics of math.Whatever things can be possible by applying formulas or whatever things can be possible through input output, we can get the code after conceptualizing that method. Now the next chapter is our chapter two i.e. Instructions and Operators. Inside this we will read what is the meaning of instructions and operators in C. Now inside this chapter, we will do a lot of numerical things which will be related to maths, along with this we will also learn many new things.When we will learn the concept, if we are seeing such pages inside the notes in which a lot of information is written then do not worry because there is no need to memorize those things together, all the notes will be available to you below when you feel like doing revision. When you feel like now I need to remember these things like a day before the exam or if you want to do revision for the interview then you can go and access them. You can read those names now.We have to naturally keep the things that are in our mind during class time in our mind. Extra, now we do not have to take the trouble of memorizing things. So, let s start the chapter. First of all, we will read what instructions are. The basic definition of instructions in C is that these are statements in a program, that is, till now all the programs we were writing in C were writing code. What was there in all of them was a sequence of instructions. Statements were written one after the other, one after the other. Whenever we see the official definition of the program, it is a sequence of instructions, like if we have to make Maggi, then there is a sequence.What are the instructions? First of all boil water, put Maggi masala in it and then put your actual Maggi in it and then let it heat. If you want to make tea then first pour water, put our milk in it, add sugar, add tea leaves, add ginger, then let it boil and then filter it. So these are some sequence of instructions. Similarly, there is a sequence of instructions inside any program which tells the program.What does it have to do? Now when we read the types of instructions, we come across three types in them. The first is the type declaration instruction, the second is our arithmetic instruction and the third is our control instruction. These three instructions have different functions and they are named according to the function, so it is not that it will be very difficult to remember them. First of all, if we talk about type declaration instructions, then what do we understand by type declaration?Ty type declaration means declaring any variable with its type, so whenever we write such statements, we write such instructions where we have to declare a variable and we have to declare its type, we give it a type declaration statement. We have been writing type declaration statements inside our C code for a long time. We can write it like if we wrote int a 4, this is also one of our type declaration statements, if we haveWritten character c is equal to est risk, this is also one of our type declaration statements, but whenever we write these statements, we make a small mistake that we forget a rule. Our rule says declare variable before using it. Whenever we are using any variable, we must declare it before using it, that is, we have to see that there is any valid value inside it. We have already told the compiler.That this variable exists in the code and then we use it. If this will not happen and the C compiler will suddenly see a variable and where it came from, then it will throw an error like if you look at its valid examples, here we have declared int a as 22. Then in int b it is written that put the value of a in b. This is absolutely correct because a has already been declared and then its value in b.The value is given and if we write it in the form of code, then inside our function we can write int a 22 and then write if int b a, then here we did not get any A error. This code which is ours will work very well. After that, what can we do if we are writing in this way also int c b 1 i.e. it is a variable already declared, you are adding something to it or else ifIf it would have been 1 or it would have been multiply by 2 or divided by 3, then also in this way, if we do operations in Arith on the right hand side and then assign it to c, then that is also valid. That is also absolutely correct. Let s see by actually writing this in the program. If c is equal to 2, if b is multiplied by 6, then no error has come to us because there is a valid statement and another type of valid.What can be the instruction? Int d 1 e. In this, what happened to us is that we declared a variable d to which we gave the value one. Along with this, we declared another integer variable e but we have not given any value to e yet. So this is a valid statement where the value of d is being assigned but not to e. We can also check this by writing in the code. Int d We have given one but whatever e is is.If no value is given then this will also be a valid statement. Now let us see some examples of invalid statements inside c like if we create a variable old age. Now inside the old age variable if we store a value which is 22 and then we create a new variable new age. Let us make new age old age plus years i.e. how many years have passed. So here the old age variable is already there but there is no years. Now suppose we are going to declare the years also. Int years is equal to 2. What is going to be our new age after 2 years. Now years, we have told inside the code that its value is 2, still why is the red line coming here because we have used it before telling the years, so before declaring the variable when we use it.If you use it then it gives an error inside s i.e. what does the compiler do, it goes line by line, in this line he has read that old age is a variable, its value is 22, in this line he has read that in new age is also our int variable, its value is the value of old age, which he knows what it was plus years, now he will get confused here that I have not read the years yet, I have not read the years yet, so that is in the next line.Was going to read that is why if there is any statement of this type then years should be at the top only then it will be a valid statement only then errors will not come in our type declaration statements, now if we consider one more type of valid statement then we can declare multiple variables together i.e. here we declared them as int a b c and after that assigned the same value to a, b, c and all three.Which is one? How is this value assigned? The value of a is assigned to c, then the value of c i.e. and is assigned to b, then the value of b i.e. and is assigned to a. So the process is like this. We can try it once in our code like if we declare some variables x y and z then we can give values x y z 4. So the statement like this is valid inside c butSame if we see the second version of this in which we give four here at the time of declaration itself i.e. make all these equal to two and we think that we skip one line, why write us extra, here the red line comes automatically. Why did this red line come because when we are assigning four to z, then its value is going to y and he is thinking that till now what is z, the compiler does not know what it is because this line is not finished yet.Inside the same line, we are also assigning a value to z and giving its value to someone else. In the same statement, we are also assigning a value to y and then giving its value to someone else, that is, we cannot use and declare together, we always have to declare first and then use the variable, otherwise c will give us an error, so we should not make the errors like this whenever multiple.Variables are defined together. If they are declared inside C, then declare them together, but their values and their usage will be discussed later. The next type of instructions that exist inside C is our Arithm that instructions. Arithm is a word that we must have read in 11th, 12th, 10th or 6th to 8th maths.Arithmetic means we understand that where plus minus multiply divide all this is going on i.e. basically all the things related to maths then if we see any statement of math like suppose we take the example of a b then inside it the things on which the operation is performed i.e. the thing which is getting plus, the thing which is being multiplied and divided, as a reminder of which we are taking out questions, we call them operants.Here a will become our operand one b will become our operand two in the same way if there was any other statement like a b c added b d then here a b c d we have four operands and the second term which we need to learn is operator operator what is the symbol which tells what operation is going to be performed like here our operator is our plus operator can be our plus operator here minus could be performing subtraction would be performing then ourThe minus would have become our operator. If we were multiplying then the asterisk would have become our operator. If we were dividing then we would call this slash our operator. So, those instructions inside s which have some operands inside them, some are operators, we call them Arithmetic instructions. Now, what can be the examples of Arithmetic instructions, we can write them like ifWe define a new variable int a 1 and b 2 and here we create a new Let s define the variable sum a b so here it is an arithmetic method, a and b are operands plus is our operator and sum is our new variable inside which our value is assigned i.e. it gets stored, similarly we can create int multiply a b b Now here multiply is a variable inside which the value of a b is stored, now whenever we go into arithmetic.Talking about instructions, one special thing we have to note is that whenever we perform any arithmetic operation on a single variable on the left hand side, all of them go to our right hand side i.e. a b c ba d. We will have an expression like this, we will assign all its values to some variable on the left which will be written on the left hand side and all these values will be stored from right to left.And in the left side, we always have to keep in mind that we have a single variable. All the output will be stored inside the single variable. If we keep in the left side that we want to store two variables int x y a b, then what will happen in this case is that the value of a b will be assigned to y but will not be assigned toIn which the value of a b is stored, then on the left it means that for this expression, we have only y in which its value is stored. After this, we will talk about what are our expressions valid in Arithmetic instructions, what are not some basic operations. We understand that in Arithmetic instructions we have plus operator, minus operator, multiply operator and divide operator. Along with this, we have one more operator.There is a module about which we are going to read right now, within this chapter, these five are our main operators. Now what will be the valid statements in it like a b c, we have written this is a valid statement, that is, here both of them are our operands, this is the operator and on the left hand side, we have written single which is a variable. Talking about the next, b c is also a valid operation because we have got multiplication and we have stored it in a.Now if we talk about invalid in the right hand side, then a is in the right hand side and our b c is in the left. Now if we were studying math, then this would be a correct statement according to math, but here for us this statement is a completely wrong statement. This statement is telling the compiler to take the value of a and store it in b c whereas b c is not a single variable because if single variable is not written on the left hand side then the statementWhat goes completely wrong is that once we write it in the code, like if we write int b c a, now there is a red line here because this statement is wrong because on the left side we should have only one variable inside which the value is stored but here if we reverse it i.e. write a here and write b c here then it will be correct but above we have to define b and c, we write b c 1, so now this statementIt will be absolutely correct because all the variables are defined and on the left side we have written only a. Now what other expressions can there be? Like what do we write in math? If we have to multiply two numbers then we write x 2 3. We put a dot there or 2 3. This is also seen like multiplication but this same thing is not valid inside c. If you write a c inside c, it will not be seen like.This will be seen as an error. What can be its example, like we write int d bc c, then what will be stored inside a, b will be divided by c and whatever amount we get will be stored inside a. At the same time, the invalid expression can be that at some places we have seen that if we have to write c to the power of b, then how do we write b c? This expression is wrong, inside c we have power inside c.There is not a single operator for power, we have to use a function, inside which first we will put b, then we will put c, this will give us the value b to the power c, so if inside a we have to store the power of b to the power c, then we will be writing something like this, if we write this, then this value will be ours. Re will become wrong, this value will become correct. Let s see its example. Inside our code, int power e is equal to b s power c. Above we just have to include one more header file include method h. This method a is a header file, that is, there are already some things inside it which we can use. So the power which we are using the function has come from the method h itself. Now we have the power if we print it.So the power of 1 and we already know that we will have only one printed, we want to print the power, we save it and run it, so we have one printed and here, if we had written b, if we save it and run it, then what output will we get, we have the output ro, now why is this row coming, we should have got an error because power does not actually exist, this operator which is there inside the na, says this.We are going to learn about JOR later. We know about JOR operator. We know that every number inside c is understood by the machine. What code does the machine understand? What code the machine understands is the machine code which is written in zeros and ones. So whenever we perform operations between zeros and ones, those are our bitwise operations. So, this is our JOUR operator which is based on bits.It is performed in between the bits i.e. in between the same bits. When you do an assertion, its output comes to us. We will be reading about bit wise operators later, but for now, if we try to write b to the power c, it is a valid statement. It is not so. Compiler r will give us an error, but the output we will get is wrong to the power of b. Our output will not come, the output will be something else, that is why we will not write it if we want to show the power.If we want to show power, then we will have to use method A and use our power function. The next topic that we are going to talk about is our modular operator, it is also called modular or modelo. It has the sign of percentage, this is our module operator. What does this operator do? If we have written a modelo b, then it will return us a reminder of a did ba b, like if you see some examples of this, there are 4 models.2 will return to us 5 modulo 3 will return to us 1 because if we divide four by two then we will get a reminder. If we divide five by three then we will get a reminder. If we do 5 3 then 1 will come to us. Here it gives the module and number so we will get a reminder. In the same way if we divide 12 by 10 then we will get a reminder only two andIf we do 20 module 10, we will get a reminder of zero, so in this way, whenever we have to find out a reminder, we use it by writing an example of our module operator. If we have to print F, an integer value in which we want to print 16 mod 10, then we already know what the answer should come to us. The answer should come to us. Six and it is printed in the answer. We have6 because when we divide 16 by 10 then six will be left. Now the module operator which is there does not work on our float values like if we write here 1.6 1.0 and after saving it if we want to run then it will not run because there are invalid operands. Our operand is 1.6 and the other operand is 1.0 so the module operator which is there only works on integer values whenever there is an integer value.When we divide 1 by an integer, it returns to us an integer. Reminder value. Now there are two cases in integer also either our enumeration can be positive or our enumeration can be negative. Whenever our enumeration is positive then the reminder that comes to us is also a positive reminder but when our enumeration is negative then our reminder also.We get negative number, how can we see its examples here, if we write 8 modo 3, save it and run it, then we get 2 in the answer because when we divide 8 by three, it will come in the reminder as two because six is already divided because our numeration is negative, so our answer also comes in the reminder as negative, but if we make this a positive eight.and if we save it and run it, now 2 will come in the output, then in this way when Also, if we want a negative reminder, we have to keep the enumeration negative. Whenever we want a positive reminder, we have to keep our enumeration positive. The next topic which we will talk about is that in the instructions, its name is Type Conversion. Whenever we have different operants, if they have the same type, then the output will also be of the same type, but if their data types are different, then the output will also be of different data type.Also, if we perform any operation on int, only int will come in the output. Whenever we perform operation on float, only float will come in the output. But if the operation of int is done with float, then float will come in the output. When we talk about the table with our data types, neither int takes ours, it takes two bytes and float takes four bytes, so in this way, the container of float is the container of this data type, that is, it can store more values.So what the C compiler does is apply a little bit of logic. How to apply the logic is that if int value is small but float value is big and any operation is done in between them, say plus or multiply or divide, a big number will come in the output. Now to store that big number, a big container is needed i.e. a container like float is needed, that is why we do not keep int in out, we keep float. So whenever the operation of int will be performed, we will have it with float.Float will come in the output. What can be its examples? Example like if we multiply int with two then the answer will come as four. But here multiply 2.0. If with two then we will get 4.0 in the output. And here if we multiply 2.0 with 2.0 then the output will be 4.0. If we write this in our code then first of all we will get F printed as 2 .2, if we save it, the output will be 4, but if 2.0 is multiplied with two, then here this error comes. Why did the error come in the first place, because the output should have been a float value, but we said that the output will be an integer value, so now we have to change it to f. Let s save it and do it again. After running the output, we got 4.00, whatever float we have.By default, after all the number of days we get, if it was 2.0 2.0, then what would have happened in that case. In that case too, we would have got the same output. What is a float value? Now instead of this operation, we can also use divide. If suppose we were dividing four by 2.2, then in this case also the output should be float. Because we have one operand of float, then a float value has come in the output. So type conversion is done in this way.How does type conversion happen? If the compiler sees that the output should be stored in a larger container because it is a larger output, then it does not forcefully store it in a smaller container on its own, that is, it will not store it in an int, it will try to save the entire output, then by default it stores it in a float. Now we can see some more special cases of this, like if we divide two with three, then because both of these are our integer values.The output should be our integer. Once we look here, we will get an integer. So we do this. D output has come to us. Because there will always be an integer output. Now when we divide two by th, then 0 point something will come but because there is an integer value inside it, we store single digits. If our whole digits are not stored, then it will make it zero. Whereas if we had taken 2.0, then we would have taken it as 2.0.Now we have a float value in the output. What is the output in float value? It gives us 0.666 667. So if we want exact output, then for that we will make any one of them float, but if we want that whatever part of the decimal is completely removed, then we will make it an integer. So, we can divide three with two. Whenever we divide three with two, then our output here will beShould come close to an integer value, one will come in the output, but if we divide 3.0 by two, then one will not come in the output. Let us also change this to f. Now we will get 1.5 in the output. So when we want an exact answer then we have to make float when we have to remove the decimal exactly. If we want a then we will make it an integer, then the type conversion is done in this way. A very interesting question based on type conversion will be solved now. In the question, we have to see the value of int a which is 1.99999. How will it work? If we assign this value to an integer, what will it do? It will remove its decimals. It will remove the decimals, that is, remove this part completely.Here, the value of a should be one or the value of a should be two. We will write that in the code that we will analyze in our code. Int A 1.99 999. Let s save it and now we will print our A and see its value to see what is actually printed. Here first of all it gave an error that the conversion from double to int is not possible, it is implicit conversion.It is not possible whenever there is a type conversion. There are two types of conversions inside C. The first type of conversion is the implicit conversion which is done by the compiler itself and the second type is our explicit explicit conversion. We as a programmer and as a user do it ourselves. Our compiler does not give it to us. This is the conversion which we want to do ourselves. This is an external conversion so it is implicit.Conversion says that the small types like type like int can be stored in float, type like int can be stored in double but float or double cannot be stored inside int, that is why automatic will not convert it, but if we want to convert it ourselves as a programmer as a coder, then we write the value here in this manner. We put two parentheses between the two and write the type in which we want to convert.If you don t want then what will the compiler do? It will forcefully convert. The compiler doesn t want to convert the big type into small but it will have to do it because we have written int. Now let s save it and now let s compile it again and see that now it has compiled successfully and now if we run our code, the output will be that will be one. So whenever it has converted this double value in C by default, all theThere are float values, they are seen as double because double is a big data type. Now when it converted this double value i.e. this value into int, then it completely removed this 999999, it does not round off. In some operations, whenever it converts from float to int, it does not round off that if it is 1.99, then make it two and then put two in int jar.It does not apply so much logic like Math, if we have to remove decimals, then it will remove the entire decimal and store only one, so we have to take special care of this thing, whenever we sit in interviews and some such questions are asked to us like tell me in C or in the class test, the question comes that what will we write in its output, then we have to remove our decimals completely. The next topic which we will talk about isLike Operator President, we had read a small rule in Math, which we called Border Mass Rule. Border Mass Rule. What did we say? First open the bracket, then divide, then multiply, then add, then subtract. In this way, if many operations are given in math, then which operation has to be done first, which operation has to be done later, we had a proper series for that, there was a sequence, similarly it is inside C.Which operation will be performed first, which operation will be performed later, this is already defined in the C compiler. Now we call the priority order in it as President, that is, the one who comes higher in priority has a higher president, the one who comes lower in priority has a lower president, so first of all they come in priority. We have multiply, divide and module operators. The priority of these three operators is at the top, after that they come in priority, plus or minus.After this comes in priority, equal to equal to within c, we also call it assignment operator, to assign to something i.e. to give something to him, like if we used to say that the monitor used to be in the school, we used to say that the post of monitor has been assigned to him i.e. it has been given to him, then whenever we give a value, we call it assignment, so if We have written a b c, so we have assigned the value of a b inside c, so in this way we understand the meaning of the things inside c. Now let s see an example, if x 4 9 10 is written, then how will we solve it. First of all, we will see whether 4 9 should be done first or 9 10. Obviously, the precedence of our multiply is high, so 9 10 first.If we do 9 10, we get 90. Now if we add four to it, then if we add four, then our answer of 94 will be stored insideWe have done the right thing inside int A, we will store 4 p 9 in 10, let s run it and in the output we have got 94. Now whatever expressions we have in one and the other way can be written, then this is the case with us, operations of same president i.e. multiply has same president and divide also has same president, so which one will be solved first, then for this we have associativity rule, these are the rules.No, these may look dangerous but they are very logical. There is no need to memorize them right now. As we solve different problems, we will also solve our practice problems. They will come on their own and are very logical to understand. Just remember their names, it was called associativeness, it was called President, there are such heavy words. There is absolutely no need for rote learning right now. The notes will be completely available to you, you can go and revise them anytime.We can also access associativity. We use it whenever we come to operators of same presidency. Like if we talk about our example, associativity says to do left to right i.e. keep performing operations from left to right. If it is of same presidency then like here multiply divide and this one is multiply of same presidency then what will we do.We will calculate from left to right. If we calculate from left to right, then first of all we will calculate 4 3. 4 3 will become our 12. Then we will calculate 12 6 this will become our 3. Then we will calculate 2 2 this will become our 1. So first of all we multiplied four by three, then we divided its output with six, then we multiplied its output with two, so in this way.We went on from left to right. If I have to show it in bracket form, what can I write? I can write, first multiply four by three, then divide it and then multiply it by two and assign the final value toFor this value, the output we will get is four because here the associativity rule is applied. Our calculations are done from left to right. Now we have read a lot of things in Arithmik s instruction, we ask some questions from them so that all the things get settled in our mind, then we do practice question four. For these four, we have to solve the questions. First of all, solve them inside our board and see the solutions on our slides.After that we will see what we will do by writing its code and verifying it. Now the first question is that we have 5 2 2 3. Here, the president of both multiply and this multiply is on the top and the minus which we have to do later, the president of both is the same for multiplication, so what will we do, we will apply the left side rule, we will multiply first by 5 2, then in its place we will write 10, the minus is in the middle and then according to the president.It should be solved by 2 3, then we solved 2 3 and wrote it as 6 and the output of both of them came to us as four, so first of all it will be solved because it is in the higher prefix and also on the left, then it will be solved because it is in the higher prefix and after the left, it comes on the right. Then our minus will be solved, so it will be 10 6 4. We write this in the code form.We will write 5 or 2 3 2. Let s put our statement here. The one which is semi sized is called a terminator. Our terminator is that AI robot from the movie. Not Terminator, Terminator means to stop something, so like he came to Apocalypto, what does it do here in the movie, it stops the statement there, so now we do it, compile and run, the output comes to us, we have four second problem, we have 5 2 divide by 2 3 here because there are three operators, the president of all three is the highest, so in this we will apply our associativity rule associativity.What does the rule say, if you calculate from left to right, then first of all we will calculate 5 2. We have 10, then we will divide 10 by 2. We will calculate 5. Now the output is 5. We will multiply it with r and the output will be 15. We will also verify this. We will write the output, divide, compile, run six. This is because here 3 has come.Malla Ba 2 We have written that actually it should have been 2 Malla Ba 3 Let s do this Compile and run In the output we got 15 Third in the problem there are 5 Mad Ba 2 2 Ma 3 Now how to solve it because Didi we are seeing the bracket for the first time So whenever the bracket comes, first of all we have to solve the thing inside the bracket, this is the single thing which is the word.It matches with the mess that when the bracket comes, first open the bracket, then the thing inside the bracket will be solved first, that is, we will have this expression 5 ml ba 1 malla ba 3. What to do now, now two operations are left, this multiply and this multiply have the same president, so apply associativity rule, then we will have 5 3 i.e. 15. Its output should also be 15, so light here.Let s change it, put a bracket, save it, the output will be 15 and the last question inside this is 5 2 2 3. What will be there in this, we have three operations in this, first of all there is addition, then there is divide, then there is multiply. Now whose higher president is higher president, whose higher president is the same president of divide and multiply, then we will put left associativity left.From associativity, what will it convert into? 5 P, first we will do 2 2, then we will multiply it by 3, then we will add it to five, this will become 5 P, the inner expression becomes 1 3, after that we will do 5 3 and this will become 8. Now let s do the same in the same output. We had the expression 5 2 divided by 2 divided by 3, save it andIf we run the AT in the output, then the questions of this type will be asked in your MCQs also, at the placement time or you will be asked in the college test of your school, then how to answer the question. If there is a theory paper, then you have to actually solve it and show how left associative will be applied. This is the best way to do it. For your convenience, you can put these parentheses, if you put brackets, you will know.Which thing has to be solved first, which thing has to be solved later and if it has to be written in the code, then the automatic C compiler will do it in the code, so it is quite easy to do these things. Just like there is a rule of border mass, similarly this is also a rule. If we do some four five questions homework problems and we will do it, then after that things will become quite clear. The next topic which we will talk about is our control instructions. Now in the beginning, we had read thatThere are three types of instructions Type declaration. We have read that the variable has to be declared first and then used. Second, we have read the Arithmetic instruction inside which we learned the new module. We learned the type conversion. We learned the president. Now we are going to read the control instructions. Control instructions are those instructions which determine and help in telling the flow of our program. What have we read till now? Instructions are running in sequence.There is a code written in it, the first statement will be executed first, that is, this statement will be executed first, after that this statement will be executed, after that this statement will be executed, but there are some statements inside the CK code which can change the flow, maybe our lower statement will be executed first and the above one will be executed later, these are the statements which have the power to change or alter the flow, we call themare called control instructions that can control the flow of Now these are of four types in a program. The first of these is sequence control. Sequence control instructions are those which keep running sequence wise, that is, one after the other, if our flow is formed, then we call them sequence control instructions. Like we have been learning till now, all these are our sequence control instructions. The second type of control instruction is what we have in decision control, sequence control.We will read about If Else. These are the instructions about which we are going to read in the coming chapters because they have to be discovered in great detail and all of them together form the basics of our C programming. So inside the Decision Control, we will further read the topic of If Else. Inside the Loop Control, we will read about the different different loops in C. Like our for loop, our while loop, we will read different loops, that is, if we have to do any task repeatedly.We have to do the same thing again and again by using some lines. We use loop control instruction in it. When we have to take a decision whether it is raining today, whether we should take an umbrella or not, whether it is sun and it is Sunday, will we be happy or not today? There are some such decisions. Whenever we write them in the code, we write them with the help of decision control instructions. After that, last comes we have case control instruction inside whichAccording to some cases, we do different things like if it is Monday to Friday then we have to go to work and if Sunday comes then we do not go to work then we have to sit at home and take rest. How can we show this entire flow in the code with the help of variables and with the help of cases that on which day we have to go to work and on which day we have to stay at home? So whenever we are writing those instructions, we call them cases.Let s put these three under control. We will read about sequence control in the upcoming chapters. We have already read it. The next topic which we will talk about in this chapter is our operators. Now we have already seen the basic of operators. What were operators. We have come to the category of operators in Arith. Plus, minus, multiply, divide, multiply, divide and module, so these are the five majors in Arith.We have already read about the operators. Now there are more different types of operators in C. We have relational operators which tell the relation between two operands. We have logical operators which bring out the logical thing between the two. Then there are also bit wise operators. Now we had talked about that inside the machine language, inside the machine code, everything is in the form of zeros and ones and in between those zeros and ones ifWe do operations, we call them bitwise operations, then there are also assignment operators, then one is ternary operator, this is our conditional operator, that is, if according to some condition we have to do something and do not do another thing, we can also write it with the help of ternary operator, it is also written with the help of ifs, it is also written with the help of ifs, it is also written with the help of majors. The thing to understand in this is relational, logical and assignment. These three are the easiest among them.After the matrix, we will read them now. We will read the ternary operator in the next chapter. Whenever we will be reading the conditional statements and we will read the bitwise operators in the coming chapters, then first of all let us talk about our relational operators. Now relational operators tell the relation between two operands. In Math, whenever we write not a b, we have to check whether a is equal to b, can we do the same inside c?You cannot write like this, if you write a b somewhere inside c, then it will mean that take the value of b and put it in a. If equality checking is not done, then whenever we have to check that the value of a means one value is equal to another value, then we put double equal to a. E b means that here we are asking the question that the value of a is equal to the value of b.What and a b means that we are putting the value of b in a, so whenever we talk about relational operators, when we talk about checking the relation, then we will be using it i.e. if we want to write double equal to in our code. Let s get Tput done, here we will write a is equal to equal to or a is not defined then 4 is equal to equal to 4. If we write this and save it and run it then we will have one in the output. What does this one show? One says the statement is true i.e. 4 e is returning 4 as true i.e. it is saying correct on the C compiler. If here te 4 3 then in this case we do not have one.In this case, it would be printed, Ro i.e. 4 is returning 3 false is false, then C is a special language in which there are no true false. Instead of true false, we have one, and instead of false, we have ro. In fact, any non zero integer is if inside c we write like 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 5, all of them represent true but if whereIf zero comes, it means false inside C. So the students who are learning C after learning Java, C PS, after JavaScript, they will find it a bit strange that there is no such thing as true and false inside C. One is there in place of true and zero is there in place of false, so if one is printed in equal to equal two, then it means the statement is true and if false is printed, then we will get zero on the screen, there are two other relations which we check.It is of greater than or greater than equal to two like if we write 3 greater than 4 it will return ro because if it is false then greater than 4 is not 4 but if we make 4 greater than 3 it will return we have true but if we make 4 greater than 4 it will return ro because forer is not greater than 4 but if 4 is greater than 4 then it will returnWell, there are some cases according to which we produce our output. Let s try them out in the code. If we wrote 4 greater than 3, it would appear in the output. But here, if we have written 3 greater than 4, then the output should now show zero i.e. false. If we have written 3 greater than 3, then zero will appear in the output because th is never greater than 3. But if we have made 3 greater than equal to 2, then it is greater.Than will check equal to also will check equal to in this case the output will be 1 so this is greater than and greater than equal to is the third relational operator which we will talk about this is our less than is equal to less than and less than is equal to same cases will remain 3 is lane 4 will return true 4 is lane 3 will return false 3 is less than 3 will return this0 and 3 is equal to 3, it will return one i.e. true, let s make cases for them too, if is greater than equal to two, lesson is equal to two, then less than is equal to two, we will have printed true, if only less than is done, then in that case we will have printed row, if 4 3, in this case we will print false because this is a wrong statement, i.e. row, and if we have done 4, lesson 5 will be printed in this case.True, this is how our relational statements work. Now we have one last special relational operator which we call not equal to. We keep its name as not equal to. We used to call it equal to two. Whenever two values are equal, it will return one, whenever they are not equal, it will return zero. Whenever two values are not equal, it will return one and whenever they are equal, it will return zero, that is, both of them are equal to each other.Opposites are like if we want to write in our statement fur is not 4 and there we want to print 4 u 4 . Whenever we put exclamation mark in C programming, we always have to read it like not . Wherever exclamation comes, it means not not not, then not operator which is a separate operator. Now this is what it is and is complete, not is equal to two, we do not have space between these two.Now we have analyzed the output once. The output of the first statement is zero i.e. false four is not equal to 4. In this statement we are saying that four is not equal to four. Obviously this is a false statement, that is why zero is printed. In the second statement, we are saying that four is equal to four, so that is why one is printed. Now here, if we had said that four is not equal to three, orWe would have said that four is equal to three. In the first statement it will be printed. Why do we have one because we are right in saying that four is not equal to three and in the second statement it will be printed as false because we are saying that four is equal to three. Which is obviously false, then zero will be printed, so in this way, whenever we have to check equal to, we will put two equal to. Whenever we have to check not equal to, then equal to with exclamation mark is called not equal to. The next type of operator which we will talk about is our logical operators. Sometimes it happens inside c that we have to check the logic of things like logical.In which cases we can use the statement, let us assume that we have created a system using c, a coding system inside which we are feeding his marks and if we say that if his marks are more than 30 and less than 90 then give him grade a and if it is above 90 or between 100 and 90 then give him grade a p. If we have to check such cases then we will have to check that the marks are 90.If the marks are above 30 or below 100 then you will have to check here. Marks should be above 30 and below 90 only then you will have to give A. So when two conditions have to be checked together or if one of the two conditions is true, like if today is a national holiday or today is Sunday then only we will go out for a walk. If any one of the two things becomes true then we will have to work. If both are true then we have to do one of the two.True, even then we have to do it, then there are some such real life cases, which we want to put in the code, then our logical operators come in handy. The first logical operator is the end operator, we also call it end, inside it, we put two ends. If you look carefully, then single end on m. If we write, then it is a bitwise operator, which we should not write here, two ends, we will always write it, then it will be a logical operator. How can we use it, like suppose weFirst statement we write 4 E 3 What will this give us This will give us one i.e. true and we write the second statement 5 is gray The 2 This statement will also give us one i.e. true If we want both these statements, then only when both the statements are true will we get the final output True, then we will put between these two, then this will be true and this will be true only then the output will come true, but if even one of these is not true i.e. here we haveIf 2 is greater than 5 then it will give zero i.e. false then the output will come to us false and for the end it is necessary that the first statement and the second statement or all the statements we are putting and between the statements should all be true otherwise false output will come like if we see its output then here we can write 4 is greater than 3 and and 5 is greater than 2 then both of these statements are true i.e. 4 is also greater than 3 andIf 5 is also greater than 2 then it is true and the ending of true will come to us as true, but here we make even one false i.e. write here 3 is greater than false then here the output we will get will come to us then this statement is true, wherever it falls on 5 and 2, it becomes a false, wherever it falls, that means it is completely false, if the end is put, then both of them will be false, then also one of the two will be false.If both are false, only then will it be printed true, then we make a table of the same. Sometimes one or two are your subjects. Even within electronics, within computer science, within IT, a table is made of these three logical operators. And if you have studied logic gates in college, then you will understand what we are talking about. If not, then perhaps you will be studying in the next semesters. So the table is made that first expression and second expression.If we have something like this, then what will be the final output? First expression is true, second is also true, then the output will be true. If we are talking about the end, first is true, second is false, then the output is false, first is false, second is true, then the output is false, first is false, second is also false, then the output will be false. So this is a small table by which we can visualize a little how our outputs come whenever we talk about logical end.Next we are going to talk about logical and. There is a symbol of pipe inside our keyboard, that is, it is a symbol of a straight line. When we write it twice, it becomes our logical and operator. Now the single pipe is also an operator, that is. Here we are talking about logical statement. What does logical statement do? If we give two statements or three statements or any number of statements and put a logical and in between them, then if even one of them becomes true, then the output will come to us as true. Rest of the rest may be false but if even one is true, then the output will come true, otherwise all the statements will be false, then the output will come out false. So if we try to write its code, then first of all we have 3, 4, which is one.There is a false statement right here, if we add and and write and 5 gr d 2, then this statement here is false. This statement is true, so in the output we had false, but in else we will have true, so its own table can also be made. In the table, if we take the first and second expression and then analyze the final output, then here if true is given then the output will be true. If if false is given in the output, then true will be false in the output.Even if true is given, the output will be true but both will be false. Only if false is coming in our output, then this is our logical or. Apart from this, there is another special operator which is our logical not operator. Logical not operator says that if true is given then make it false. If false is given then make it true i.e. whatever is given to us, we have to invert it inside the expression, whatever it may be, like if an expression is 3 4, we know that it is false.If the second expression is 5 1, we know that it will give true, but if we put not there, it will give false, so in this way, whenever the output of the expression has to be reversed, we have to flip, then we put not, here we know that 5 1 will give us true, but if we put not next to it, then in the output we will get false i.e. zero, if we talk about two expressions too.Do this i.e. 5 gr 1 which is it will give us true and and or and put here and and 3 gr 4 its output if we go to guess 5 gr the 1 will give true 3 gr 4 will give false between the two and and is true and one is false then the output will be false but outside all this we have put not so instead of false we are going to have true printed here we put another bracket in the output we know we haveIf it should be printed true then it is printed as true i.e. one. This is how our logical operators work. We will learn the actual importance of these logical operators in the next chapter when we will talk about conditional statements. Whenever we write conditional statements with if else then we have to put a condition inside it whether that condition is true or false. So there we use these expressions the most.Must have been, now here we have a question that within a single expression we can also write some arithmetic operators. In a single expression like arithmetic operators we can write a b c d e in this way and inside the single expression we can also compare them i.e. this value is greater than 4 3 5. In this way we can then end the value 4 2 so we can write an expression so long.Within which our relational operators will be coming, then how is the president decided in them, then they also have their own operator president order in which there is a priority wise president, the highest president is given to us, wherever the not operator comes, first of all we have to do not, after that all the other things have to be done, after that multiply divide module, then plus minus comes, then our relational operators come again.We go to the relational operators, equal to and not equal to, then come our logical operators in which first we look at and then how it will be, then we look at how it will happen and then comes equal to i.e. assignment operator. First all the above mentioned things will be done then going to the left hand side whatever is written in it we will assign the value. In this way the president remains, there is no need to remember this also, the major things which have to be remembered in this are these.The note will be done first, relational comes on top, logical comes below, so we will keep it in this manner, rest whenever you have to refer in the calculation, you can go and refer to these same notes. Now after this We read the type of the one and operator. This is a very easy operator. The easiest operator which is going to be our assignment operator is to assign. We have already read what does equal to. If a is e b then it will put the value of b in a. If c d then it will put the value of d in c. If e f g h then it will put the value of this entire expression in e. This is the work of assignment operator. After that, our plus equal to operator.This is basically our short hand operators. What are short hand operators? What do they do? Let us tell you how to shorten the long and difficult statements. Like if we have written a a p b, if we write this thing in our code, int a 1 int b 4 and we want to write int or a a p b, then what should come here, b is 4, a is 1, p 4 will be 5, then the value of a will now become F.By printing it, we can tally it. If five comes in the output, then the value of a becomes five because by combining four and one it becomes five. Now we will notice that a is written on the left and a is written on the right. When the same expression is written on the left and right, that is, the same variable is written, then we can make it smaller. How can we make this a a b, we can write a is equal to b.So here plus equal two has replaced equal two a, so in this way, whenever we use the same variable on the left and right side again and again, we can replace equal two with plus equal two, then that operation will be performed like here if we write the statement a b and then check its value then the same output will come to us. Which is now the same thing which we have done.Along with the plus, they can also do the same with multiplication. Here, if you write Ag , multiply equal to two, then what will happen is 4 1, both will be multiplied, then there will be a fur in the output, while if you write Minus , what will happen in the minus? The meaning of this statement is a a b, so a is 1, b is 4, 1 4 3. So in a, we should get 3 as printed. Let s tally it, if 3 is in the output, then in this wayWhenever we have to shorten the expression because we are using the same operands on the left and the right, then what we will do is we will write minus equal to two, we will write multiply equal to two, same for divide, same for module, these are our easiest operators, our assignment operators, so in this way, our basic operators were the basic instructions, we have completed them, now we will do some problems, after doing these problems, the things that we will learn now.We have read in Chapter Two and it will sit inside our mind. The first question is to write a program to check if a number is divisible by two or not. Now we have to write a program to check if a number is divisible by two or not. Suppose any number x is given to us, the value ofFor example, suppose 4 gets divided by 10. If it gets divided by 5, then what does it give as a reminder? 4 and 2 also give a reminder as zero. So here we have to use our mind to give a reminder to 2. If any number is divided by another, then here we will use our model operator. So what will we do, we will take any number as input. In the input, we have taken one, now we will see the model of x with x, if thisModel becomes zero, there is a case that it becomes zero, it means it is divided, there is a case where it is not zero, other than zero, suppose it is not printed, it is human or mine, anything other than zero means it is not divided, then simply what to do is to take input of a number from the user and then check its module with 2. If the module is returning zero, then it means it is divided, otherwise it is not. Now let s write the code for this and check X first.We declare then scan F and first print F. Enter a number. Here we will enter the number then we will scan it. Percentage D andOperator President If operators were below then here first the module ofWill 10 be printed as one in 10 because 10 is divided with two, whenever we entered 10, the module of 10 came out first with two, then what was the module Ro, if we compared that row with Ro, it returned true, then it returned true, but here in the case of five, the module of five came with two, so we compared one with Ro, it was not equal to two, that is why Ro was printed.That means false, now there is another version of this, that version of the same program is Tell if a number is even and odd. The numbers which are divided with two are our even numbers. The numbers which are not divided with two, that is, their module does not come to us as zero, they are our odd numbers. So, whenever we have to check whether a number is even or odd, then check division by two for that too, so this is our next practice.Question in which write a program to check if a number is odd or even. Whenever we have an even case, we are going to print one in it. If there is an odd case, we are going to print zero in it. So, we have entered the number and stored it inOne is printed in 16, that is, 16 is our even number because it is divided by two. Now if we talk about seven, then in the case of seven, zero is printed because seven is our odd number. The next question says Are the following valid and not? The first statement is int e 8 and this one is the symbol 8. Now here we have already talked about our expectation, we are expecting 8 two.The power 8, which should be a big value, will not be printed here, rather it will be printed as zero. How will zero be printed? Once we see it in the code, let s remove all this and get it printed here. 8 zero is printed because what the compiler did is not take it as power of 8. It took it as 8 equal to 8. And when equal number is equal to same number, then zero is always in the output, that is why here we have.Zero has come in the output. This is a bitwise operator about which we have already talked about it. We will talk about it later. And its output does not give us power. For power we have to use the PO DB POW function. But did this statement run? Yes did this statement run? Did the compiler return any error? No? The compiler did not return any error. That s why the statement does not give us power, but it is a valid statement. Let s talk about the second statement int x.After that, we have our terminator, then int y After solving this, let s see that int x and int y There is an error because the terminator has been removed, which means it is on the same line. If it is on the same line, then we have used one in the same line in which we are declaring it. So here the rule of type declaration has been broken and this is where our third problem comes. In the third problem, what did we have that it is in the same line and in the middle we have a comma, so it was valid but this is what happened to us in Valid statement is the fourth statement. We have defined a character inside it with the name stars. We have stored two stars inside it. We see whether it is valid or not. Inside our code we write care stars is equal to two stars. Star is save it. Now let us compile this statement. Once compiled, we have a warning generated. What the warning says is that we have made it a multi character constant, meaning we have put multiple characters here.This is an error thing, we cannot do this, if we put space inside the character then it will also not compile, the same thing will ask why you have put space, that is why whenever we create characters, we have to put a single value inside them, only then they will compile successfully. If we are writing one here, then whatever is one, it will compile, but if two is written along with one, then there are two characters here, in a way, thisIt will not compile ours, it will give us the warning of implicit conversion. Why are these warnings given because if we put multiple characters or even if we put star star then it takes up so much space inside the memory which is bigger than the space given to the character. So should we put it in a bigger container? Then it thinks that it will not fit in the small container with the character. Should I put it in a big container but it automatically implies that.Can t do it because it doesn t automatically put the character in an integer, that s why this warning is generated here, so we don t have to do this whenever we are defining a character. We have to define a single value character. We will call this statement invalid because here the compiler is throwing us a warning. In the next practice question, we have to tell whether to print true or false for the following statement first.The statement is If it is Sunday and it is snowing then print true i.e. if it is Sunday and it is snowing then print true. How to convert it into program form? First of all, we take two variables. The first variable is int is Sunday. The second variable is int is snowing. So now if we put true in is Sunday and if we put true in is snowing then we print F. This is Sunday.When it is true and end is snowing, when it is true then only we have true print i.e. this is also true and this is also true. If it is Sunday and it is snowing then only we will print true, so already we have kept both of these as true. Let us see whether our output is coming true or not, then we have true in the output. Let us assume that it is not Sunday, there is some other day, then this Sunday will be false and now if we run it, then in the output,We will get zero because one of the two conditions fails and what does the end do? If even one condition fails then it will make the whole false. Now the second question says if it is Monday and it is raining then make it true. Either it is Monday or it is raining then it will be printed as true here and in place of whatever is there, we will do our logical and operator so we will make it is Sunday, it is Monday, we will make this knowing that it is raining here.But if it is not Monday then we will make it zero. If it is raining then we will make it one. Here we do it is Monday. Here we make it is raining. Now there is one condition which is false, one condition is true. Now if any of the two is true then we have to print it as true. So for that we will use logical and and let s run it and see that it will be printed. Our pass is true. The third condition says if a number is greater than n i.e. a number is x.If it is greater than nine and less than 100 is less than 100 then we will print it as true. So we have to check for one number that it is greater than nine and that same number is less than 100. These are both the conditions. Both the conditions should be true. We will put our logical AND operator in between and then we will print one instead of true. Now we can say this in a way that we are going to write the condition for writing the statement.So that we check whether it is a two digit number or not, the number which is greater than nine and less than 100 will always be a two digit number, so whenever we have to check the condition of a two digit number, we write this statement in our code, then whenever such a question comes, we have to print this same statement. Inside that question, first of all we write the code for it. Let s define a variable and then print it on the screen. Enter the number. Get the number entered. Then we will calculate the percentage of that number. D andNow if we run the same code and this time we enter the number, 101 will be printed, then it will be zero because it is not a two digit number, so far we have read about C, we can make very beautiful logical programs by combining different operators. Is there any logic in the world that exists, that is, a thing like Math which is very logical, a thing like Physics which is very logical, anywhere if logic exists whoseWe can make any formula, we can make any process, that thing can always be converted into a code, so here we have converted our thing into a code, many beautiful programs, what we learned, how to check odd even is very basic and is asked in many mid semesters, in colleges, if you are giving initial rounds of companies like TCS, then they can also ask you initially, otherwiseSuch questions come in your MCQ rounds. If we have to check whether a number is a two digit number, then we have seen its condition. Apart from this, in the next chapters we will be discovering many more such logical questions and solving them in very simple ways. After this, we will be given a homework problem which is a homework sheet, we will have to pause it and solve it on our own if we are not able to solve it.If an error occurs, we will find solutions in our notes. We can go through those problems and practice asking questions to ourselves. So here our chapter two ends and we move towards the next chapter which is Conditional Operators. Hi everyone and now we are going to start with our third chapter which is named Conditional Statements. Conditional statements are very important in C and this is ourNow we are doing the basis of programming form, before reading the conditional statements, let us see some real life examples of them, like suppose we have a character given to us like M for Monday, T for Tuesday or A W for Wednesday, then in this way we have to take the character and according to whatever character, whatever day it is, we have to get it printed or apart from this, we get a mark sheet inside the school, in which what happens is that we are given some grades, like if yourIf you have got 90 plus, you would have been given A plus plus, in 80 to 90 you would have been given a plus, in 70 to 80 you would have been given A, in 60 to 70 you would have been given B. If the grading system is in this way, then if we have to write the entire grading system in the form of code, then we will need conditional statements. Suppose such a scenario is being created that if we have light then we have to print morning and if there is darkness then we have to print.There are some such things which sometimes have to be written in the code or if we are going to buy any goods from the market, like suppose you buy clothes, you buy gadgets, then you have to pay some tax on them, but on the other hand, if you buy books from the market, you do not have to pay tax on them, then according to which goods you are buying, your software will decide how much tax will be levied on you. There are programs like this.In these, your conditions are checked, like in the condition to calculate the tax on the item, the condition will be checked that what is the item, then it will be told how much tax will be charged on it, first it will be seen whether it is dark or light and then it will be told whether it is to be printed, first it will be seen which character is there, then it will be printed which day of the week we are talking about, first it will be seen how many marks you have got in your subject, then it will be printed that how many grades you have in that subject, then like thisSituations where we look at a condition and act accordingly and get anything done are called conditional statements. Coming to the category of conditional operators, now whenever we talk about conditional statements in C, we will read two types of statements, the first of which is our FL statements and the second is our switch statement. If means in English, if and else means if that thing does not happen then do this thing, then our FFL statements are formed in this way. Now if we look at the syntax, how to write FFL statements.So first of all we write the if keyword. This is a keyword of C. It means that the compiler of C already knows what the meaning of if is. Then we put parens and then we write any condition inside it. Now we have already read the conditions. How will we write any relation whether our character is equal to m? In that case get it printed as Monday or marks. If we have to write the condition then marks if ourGreater than is 80 and end marks are if our less than is equal to 90 then in this case the grade that we want to print is suppose to be a then the conditions of this method are what we are writing here that what condition should I check which if it becomes true then do this thing and if false then do this thing then this is our if statement this is our else statement we have our own block of else statementElse is also a keyword, if this condition becomes true, then whatever is written inside it means whatever is written inside these two curly braces, it will be executed, but if this statement becomes false, then this is the else block, these two curly braces, whatever is written inside it will be printed or whatever work we have given to the compiler to do, it will be done. Now whatever is this else inside the if else condition.If is not compulsory then it is obviously compulsory. Else is our optional. Else is our wish. We want to get some more work done. If the condition fails or even if we don t want to get it done then we can remove the else completely. Now let s do some examples of this. First of all define a variable inside our code. Let s assume we have stored 19 in the else edge. Or better yet, let s take the input of the else from the user.First we print enter age and after that we will scan the age. Percentage D and age. From here we remove the assignment from the declaration. Now as soon as we have the age, first of all we will check. Now in age we know that the one whose age is above 18 is an adult. The one whose age is below 18 is not an adult. So we are going to write the same statement in the code here. If our age is greater than 18 in that case.We want to print adult . We will look at this statement a little carefully. First of all, we have written the if keyword to check the if condition. Inside we have written our condition. The condition of ours was that the age should be greater than 18, only then the person whose age we have taken is an adult. So, we had already read how to use the relational operator. We will compare this constant with the variable that age is our variable 18, which is ourConstant is greater than or not and if this statement becomes true, if this condition becomes true, then in that case we will execute whatever is written here, so it is written here adult, so if this condition becomes true, then we will have adult printed in the screen, but suppose this condition becomes false and in that case, we want to print not adult, then what will we do, we will write else in this way and then also that.We will make a block of curly braces, whatever lines are there in between the curly braces, we call it a block of curly braces. If we complete our print F here, then we will write not adult in the next line and save it. Now here we could write multiple lines also. Now if he is an adult, then obviously we know that he can vote. If he is 18, he will be able to vote. If he is 18, he can also drive.If found then we write here can drive also so in this way if this condition is true then all the three statements will be printed and if the condition is not true then there is only one statement in this block. Now between these two curly braces comes the chunk of the entire statements, this group comes, we call them block, inside C or any A block inside a programming language is a combination of statements in which we enter many statements, so all three will be executing simultaneously, we save it and run it, compile it, run it, first enter 15 that our age is 15, in this case it is printed as not adult, now if we run it again, this time we will enter age 22 and this time it is printed that we are not adult.They can vote, they can drive, so in the case where we have put that statement which will not be true, that means here it became false, then it went inside else, then not adult, it printed it, but in the case where we put 22 and this condition will be true, then all these statements got executed but together it did not happen, that means this one statement did not get executed. Now after this, if we want to write something in the last thank you, then it will get executed, will it be an obstacle?Yes, this statement will be executed in every case because there is neither if nor else before it, that is, whatever the condition is, it must be executed. We see the example of this too, compile and run it. Now if we enter 19, then in that case all these conditions are printed, all these statements along with the last one thank you will always be printed even if we enter less than 18.Now enter this else which is bigger than 18. It is not compulsory. Even if we remove it, suppose we just have to check whether this statement is bigger than 18 or not. If it is smaller then in that case we will not print anything. Still, our program will be successfully compiled. This time, if we enter 15, then only thank you will be printed. Nothing else will be printed because there is no else, only this statement will be true or not, that will be checked, so in this way ourIf Else works, now there is a special thing inside If Else. If we have written multiple statements inside If or else, then we have to put curly braces, but these curly braces are not compulsory. If we have to write only one statement, like in the case of If, we have to write only one statement. In the case of Else, we have to write the same statement. Thank you, the last one, we remove it from here for now and weIf you save then this program will be getting compiled and running even without curly braces. If you enter 23 then you will see that adult has been printed and no error has come. So if we have a statement then we can work without curly braces also. But the good programmers bring consistency in the program and if we want to become a good programmer then we have to put curly braces every time. So I would have used curly braces every time.Because let s see an example, if you do not use curly braces and write multiple statements, then what will happen? We have written de can vote de can vote here, now let s save it, so here already an error has come that else is there, it should always come after an if , what did it do with this if , it merged this single one which is the beginning printed statement, but it did not count the second printed statement along with the if .It counted separately, then came this else after else, thought where is its if because for this there is no if above, normal statement is written above, instruction is written, that is why there is no confusion in this way, whenever we have to write any program, we always have to put curly braces in it, no matter how many lines there are, now whenever our if is not true, after that if we have to check whether any other condition is true, is the above one not true or the below one?If the one is true, then we write Else If Else If. What is the format of writing? If we have written above, then we can put our condition one inside it, then whatever if we have to do, put it in the first block, then write else if, put the condition true inside it, like if we take the example of marks, if our marks are greater than 90, then you print a and here check that the marks are what they are.Less day is 90 but greater day is 80 then in that case just print a and the output of that condition is true will come inside it. In this way after this we can write one more LCF, we can write as many LCF as we want and after that at the end if we have to do if none of the above is true then do else. In this way, whenever our flow of program is made, we create our if block at the top, after that we create our LCF block, after that we write another LCF, as many LCFs as we want and at the end we write an else, so if you want to use all of them, then the flow will be like this. What will happen in it? First of all, a condition will be checked, if it is not true, then a second condition will be checked, if it is not true, then a third condition will be checked, if it is true.Let s say it becomes true then after that there will be no check and if all the above are false then there is no check in the last else else if all the above are false then the work written is done without checking. Now if we want all our conditions to be checked, meaning even if this also becomes true then this thing is still being checked, then in that case we write if, many one after the other, this check will happen ifIf it is true then it will happen, otherwise it will not happen then this check will be done if it is true then it will not happen, it will not happen, it does not matter whether the above one was true or false, then when the above condition does not make any difference to the below condition, then keep writing if again and again and again and again, and if the above condition is making a difference, like if we had to check the marks, then if a p is printed once above, then a below should not be printed again, we have to take care of it, that is why we are in it.If we use LCF, then we write our own format for LCF also. Let s solve it with an example. We do it in the case of edge only. If edge is greater than 18, then we will write adult. Now, by doing an else if in it, we put the condition that our edge is greater than 13 and and edge is less than equal to 18. Well, here equal to 18 should come and thisIt should be less than 18, so here we will write teenager and in the last we will write else print F child. Thank you, we remove this. Now look carefully, what we have done is ask for age from the user. If our age is 18 or older than 18, then in that case we have to print adult. If age is older than 13 but younger than 18, in that case whoever is the person is a teenager as per age, then in that caseIf a teenager gets it printed, then this condition is checked and if none of the above two cases are there, then this case will be printed, that is, the child is not above 18, not even between 13 and 18, so obviously he will be below 13, so there is no need to check, just get the child printed, save it and compile and run it. First of all, we enter the age.Five years, in that case child is printed, after that again enter the age. If suppose we have put 16, in this case teenager is printed and again we have put our age 22, then in that case adult is printed. So in this way, what things should be done according to different different conditions, we can do that with the help of FS in our code. Now the next type of statement which we will talk about, before the switch, we are going to talk about the second chapter of conditional operator.In this article we had read that there are five types of operators, some of which we will read in the upcoming chapters. Now our ternary operator is a very important type. There are many MCQ questions at the time of placement. Many companies ask questions related to ternary operator. This ternary operator is also there in your C , it is also there in Java and it has the same syntax. It looks exactly the same in both the languages and in factThose students who once learn C, they do not face any issue in shifting to C P or Java because almost the syntax is same in many things, only the difference is in the input and output. Now what is the way to write the turner operator. Let us first understand the usage of turner operator whenever we have many lines. Simple if else means checking the condition in if else and then doing something. If we can shorten it like let s say.We have to check the value of the variable, if age is our greater than 18 then here if age is a variable then print adult otherwise not adult. In that we saw that we have written many lines meaning if we see the first one also 1 2 three and else three more then our code is happening in six lines. How to convert that six lines of code into single line. If there is a ternary operator, then the syntax of the ternary operator is that first of all tell your condition, what is the condition, after that put a question mark. This is the function of the question mark that it will check, it will question whether your condition is true or not. If your condition returns true then whatever is written here will be executed, otherwise we put this colon after that, it means no.So it will check that if the condition comes true then this will happen otherwise what is written after that i.e. if the condition fails then this remains our syntax, we can check it once by writing an example of ternary operator like we had entered the edge, now how do we execute the ternary operator if our edge is greater than equal to 18, if it is 18 and it is true thing then thatIn this case, we are going to print adult, otherwise we are going to print not adult. Now one thing is very important to pay attention in this line, that is, after this print F statement, we have not put a semicolon, that is, we have not put a terminator, why because right now we do not have to finish the statement, we have to do the statement at the end, then even if it becomes true and if we have to write print F in the middle or scan F, we have to write anything, then we will not put a terminator here because if we have put a terminator, then ourThe condition which is there will be finished, our statement like if we had run it once before, compiled it, after running it, if we entered age as 15 then it got printed as not adult. What did it do? First it checked the condition, after that if it was true then it had to be done but if it was not true then it got the next condition which is not adult printed. Now if we had put a terminator right here, then the first error would have occurred because of the terminator.After that, we cannot apply semicalculus, that is why it would not be right to put terminator here. Also, turn operator has to be used only when we have a single line. Because we cannot put terminator here, whenever we have to write a single statement in if else, we can use ternary operator instead of it. This is very important. The syntax is very good. This operator does not have much practical usage. Mostly in your placements orIf this is asked in the exams, then we can keep it in mind. Now the name of the next conditional operator we will talk about is Switch. Just like we must have seen the light switches in the house, we must have seen the switch of the TV, what does a switch do? If you turn it on, it does some work. If you turn it off, it does not do anything. In the same way, there is a switch inside our coding, which if you turn on the condition, it will give you the work and if it does not, then it will not be your job to write the switch.The syntax is such that first of all we write the keyword, we switch, inside it we write some number or character and basically what the switch does is to match some constants with that number or character, like the number you have given as edge, then the constant becomes ours 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Lad, this is a very impractical case for the switch. In this way, we have got many constant numbers, then whatever your edge is, then it becomes ours.It will match the case, that is, if it has matched your edge with one, you had put one in the edge, it has matched it with one, then whatever is written next to it, it will do that work and give it to you. So, in this way, you have switched it on, after getting the case matched, then it will do the work and give it to you. Now we write the switch, inside it, we can enter only numbers or characters with whatever variable we have to match, then it checks the cases, here we write some constants likeOne is done, two is done, then we write in this way, case one, case to case. And in terms of character, if we want to do it with character, then case A, case B, we have to write the constant after the case, after that we have to put a colon, then write all your statements, all the statements, in the same way, we will write the next case, whatever the statement is, and at the end, break must be written. The work of the break is to take you out after the case, if it is not the break from the switch.If it happens then all these statements will be executed. If one switch is turned on and you have not written break then all the switches will be turned on. After that, break means that if you have written all the switches. If you don t want to turn on then that is the default behavior. If you don t turn on all the switches then break after the first switch and lastly our case is a default case that if none of the above is true then do this thing. Now it is like our else that if none of the above if else or else if is true then execute your else. The default is the else of the switch. Now let s take an example of this.What will we do inside the example? We are going to take input from the user. Day means int day. We will take input from the user. What is the meaning of day here? One means Monday, two means Tuesday, three means Wednesday and so on. We have asked the user to enter the number of days till seven. Here we can write from one to sen and then we will write here and day. Then we will write our switch inside the switch. This is just that you are coding inside VS Code, so once youPress enter, all the things which are written will come, but since we are writing for the first time, we will write from the beginning. After the switch, we start the parens, whoever we have to check, inside the parens, we will write the variable, we have to check whom, we have to check the day, then we will put curly braces. Now inside this block, we will write all the statements. First of all, we will write case one. What does case one say that whatever our day is, it is Monday, so we have written Monday, now after this we will break in the same way.We are going to write six more cases, so here we will do case two, inside that we will write our day Tuesday, put the next line in it, put the next line here, our case three, inside this too, the next line is case four, this is going to be case fi is Friday, now let us assume that our user has given us by entering 29, so in that case we cannot print anything, so in that case we will write the default here i.e. our else s one.Case now by default we will print not a valid day. Now after the default we do not have to write break because after the default there is no switch which we can turn on after this. Now let s save it. Once we run the code then we will understand well how the compile run is done. First of all we have to enter the day. We enter let s say three three. If we enter then Wednesday is printed for us as soon as the value of day is entered.Three was stored, what did the switch do? It started searching for a match of three. With the constants, it first checked with one. Falls came, checked with two. Falls came with three, three was matched. As soon as the match was made, it executed this condition, after that it did a break, so it came out. Now let s assume that this break does not happen here or else we comment it out. Let s comment out this break too. If we comment out all these breaks,And let s save it and compile it once again and run it, then now if we enter three, we entered three, then what was printed for us, first Wednesday was printed, meaning Monday and Tuesday were not printed because there was no match there, as soon as we matched with three, it means we switched on, now Wednesday got printed, after that all got printed, Thursday was also printed, Friday was also printed, Saturday was also printed, Sunday was also printed and after that not.A valid day is also printed i.e. all the switches after that have turned on, that is why break is useful for us because we do not have to turn on all the switches, we have to turn on only one switch, like when it becomes on, you go out from here, hence whenever you write switch, it is very important to apply break. Now let s check the default once, if we enter, let s say 19, then 19 is not a valid day, it will be printed for us, so in this way ourWhatever the switch is, it works. Now for the same code, we can also play with the characters like this day, we have made it not of integer type, let us make it of character type and for Monday we will have M, for Tuesday we will have T, for Wednesday we will have small W, for Thursday we will keep capital T, for Friday we will keep F, for Saturday we will keep small S and for Sunday we will take capital S. So in this way we will take our day.And here now we change the case, we will write the characters in the case, we save it and now we run it again, so here we have to write S, if we de our enter. So this time we are going to enter F, then Friday is printed for us and this time we have entered any other character like suppose we have entered t the rate, in that case what is printed is not a valid day, so we can use the characters as a constant and we can also use our integers as a constant. Now after this, the switch has some properties of its own, like mainly about two properties, we will talk first of all about the cases can.As we wrote B in any order, not A, first of all we wrote that for one, Monday is to be printed, for two, Tuesday is to be printed, so we could have made them up and down also. Maybe the condition of Tuesday is that if there is two, then Tuesday is printed, it is coming up and if there is one, then Monday is printed, it is coming down. The switch in it does not give an error like we have done here. Dub is there, which comes after F in our characters, but in the case of D, we have it above.The one is below, if we write this Friday also above, then no error will be coming. The second thing is that nested switch means switch inside switch is allowed. We can have inside the switch, we can write our own separate switch inside the switch, like which day is outside, we have made cases for it and consider the case as number three. When the number becomes true, then after that, put another switch and we will put the year which year is going on or will put it.Which month of the month is going on, then in that also our case four, suppose it becomes true, then in this way we can put the switch inside the switch and above we had to read that inside the if also we can put the different if, once inside the if i.e. if the condition is one, it becomes true, then the second if which has the condition two, you print it. In this way, we call the if statements as nested nests.Nesting one inside the other, we call it nested if. Let s see an example of this too, like suppose we have to enter a number from the user, then we will print the entered number and then scan it. Now let s write some conditions for the number. First of all, we will check whether our number is positive or negative. Then what will we do for a positive number? We will check if the number is greater than equal to 0 in that case.For the number in I, we will be printing it as positive and if it is not so, it means else. Well, we can write this else here also. Usually, I prefer to write it in the same line, then for else, we will print it as negative. Now inside this, as soon as the number becomes positive, then we have to check whether our number is even or odd. We will print that too. So here we can write one more f that the number is modo two if our equal.The condition of doubles becomes two zero. We have already read it in the practice set of Chapter Two, so it should be quite easy for us to understand that how here we have checked that the number is even, so here we will print it. If it is not even, then it can also have its own else. We are going to print it as odd. Let s save it. Now let s run it once. We enter the number that is 24. For 24, it is printed that this isThere is a positive number and an even number, so what did it do? One condition became true, after that it also checked the other condition to see whether it is true or not. We can write these same conditions inside the else also. By going here, we can create our own if condition and then the else condition. In this way, whenever the if condition is written inside another if, we call this situation as nested if or nested.Now let s practice some questions to put our concepts very well in the mind. First of all our question is, write a program to check if a student passed and field. We will have the marks of a student which will be given. Out of 100 marks will be given to us. If our marks are more than 30 then the child has passed. If it is less than 30 then our child has failed. Then the same.If we have to convert the situation into code, then first of all what we will do is enter the marks. Here we will create this variable. Enter the marks and give the range of marks from zero to 100. Some children also get zero and those poor people get absent on the day of paper. And here we will write the marks. Now we have to write two conditions, one for pass and one for fail. So first of all let s try to write it with a fuffle in if.will put if If the marks given in our question are less than 30 or less than equal to 30, then in that case we have to print it as fail and if it is not so, then in that case we have to print it as pass. So here we will open the terminal, compile run marks, we will put ours, we will put 56, we have passed. Let us run it again and assume that we have put 105 because we are the devil children of the class and even after putting 105, we passed.It was printed while we had to enter it till 100, so we can put our condition in it that if the marks which are greater than ours are 30 then the marks are equal to 100 then in that case then print the pass otherwise there is another else in which we are going to print the color marks. In this also we can put the condition that the marks which are there should be greater than equal to 0 and end marks.Less than equal to 30, so in this way, when we write statements covering all the cases, our code remains safe. Now we will compile this also and this time, if we thought that we will enter 105, then this time it will be printed for us. Wrong marks, so in this way, we have to enter the safe cases. Now, we could have done the same thing with the help of ternary statement also, i.e.If we comment it out, to comment all these lines together, we have to press command and slash. So if you again want to convert any majority chunk of statements into a comment, then you have to press command slash or if we are on Windows system, we will not be able to check many statements in it. Marks if on ours, because ternary is for a very simple condition. Marks if our less than.Question mark is equal to 30, in that case we will get it printed, otherwise we will get it printed as fail. So here we understand the magic of ternary operator that it has converted four or five lines of code into a single line. Now let s do this. Run Marks. We are entering our 23, so we have failed. And on the other hand, if we enter 89, then in that case we will pass. Now second practice.Talking about the question, in this case we have been given more cases like write a program to give grades to a student. The first condition in this is marks. If the class day is 30 then C grade has to be given. Between 30 and 70 then B has to be given. Between 70 and 90 then A has to be given and between 90 and 100 then A Ps has to be given. Now we have to write these four conditions in the form of code.If yes, then marks start one after the other. We must have given marks. In this case, we cannot use ternary because ternary is very complicated. We will check the marks. If our marks are less than 30, then in that case we will print C as our grade. Now we will apply else if. If the above condition has failed, then check the below one that our marks are greater than equal to 30 and end marks are less than ours.What was the condition of 70? Now whenever I take a question with marks, I try very hard to give more grades so that even if a child has got less, he does not feel bad. While watching the video, in this case this grade will be given and then we will write else if this time marks are greater than equal to our 70 and end 70 and end marks are less than 90 then in this case we are going to print same conditions print.We will do A and last but not least, our Else case will come in which we will print A or A for ourselves. Teachers don t give much plus plus, so these are our four conditions which we have written in the form of fff else , we will open the terminal window, we will compile, we will run the code. Now we have to enter our marks. Let s assume that my marks of Physics are 98, wow I got an A . Whereas if you want to enter any other subject, then we can also enter that likeSuppose we have got 40 in a subject, then our grade in it will be B, then in this way you can make a small mini project of your own in which you can apply the formula to calculate your grade according to your marks, which is your curriculum sheet of your college or school which defines what grade will be given on how many marks, or even if you want to make an application of supermarket, how much tax is to be levied on which items and the final value after levying the tax.will come You can make a program for that too, so many such programs would have been given in the homework problems also. Now let s move towards our next question. The next question is our practical code. We have been given this code. There should have been a question mark here. Now here we have been given a code in which intSo we will printWrite down T, write down 1, write down 2, all these values become ours. We will use this thing here. First of all, you stop and guess once, logically guess yourself, don t guess. Basically, I would say analyze what should be the answer to this. Out of these three, let s think of answers out of these three. Put the region yourself and if it doesn t come or even if it has come, then after that you have to check the region.First of all, let s execute it and see what its output is going to be. We have already written intFor us x 1. Now why is this printed because x is equal to 2. This happened because if we have to check thatAnd we put P one there, now inside this if condition, the value ofSo now it will be printed x 1. If we want to print x then it is not one and its value has already been written. Now we will writeThe line has removed the t from the value ofCompile and Run In this case it will be printed that x is not equal to 1 because if the value ofBecause you are not checking equality, you are doing assignment inside the if which is logically considered wrong but according to the compiler rules, if not wrong then the correct output here will be print x e 1 becauseA character entered by the user is upper case and not upper case. What are the characters a b Kapil a Kapil b Kapil c This way What is lower case? Small A Small B Small Simple D. In this way, we call them upper case. We call them lower case. We have to check whether our character which has been entered by a user is upper case or not. For this let s see what technique we will use. First of all, we create a program in which character C is to be entered by the user. Enter the character in it. We will scan F, percentage C and C. Now we will check whether our character is C and C.It is greater than equal to a. We might not have seen this thing because we always compare with integers, we do it with floats, for the first time we are comparing the value of character with character with relational operator, so this is also possible because internally how C works, every character has an Esc value, so the Esc value of a is probably 97 and in this way, many of our characters till z.There are different values, so if we want to check the lower case, then we will check it with a. Here this is our single value also getting printed. 97 For us, if we do b here, then what will be its S value. 98 In the same way, if we do c, then it will be 99. So there are S many values. A value is basically that every character has its own integer which is associated with it and is known to the compiler.If it is an integer, then either we can directly compare the character with a value like writing character is greater than equal to 97 and character is greater than equal to a, this means the same for the compiler, so either you write this line or this line, there will be no difference, so here we are going to compare with capital a, so capital a has one value.65 And and C is less than equal to capital G. S kai value of capital G is 90 so it keeps increasing i.e. it will be of capital A which will be 65 then capital B of 66 capital C of 67 it keeps increasing in this way if our character is bigger than thisIn American English we say ji then we have to print F then we have to print F in upper case, in this case we will write upper case otherwise in else else let s check one more case that sich is our if sich if our greater than equal tool is A and and C is our lesson is equal to sloppy then in that case we are going to print lower case. Now apart from this, our ast risk is M percent, all those are also hashtag hash character this.All the characters are present in it, we will print not English letter. It is not an English letter. You have printed some other character and given it to us. After all this, let s put a next line, save it and run it. Now we have to enter the character. Suppose first of all we are entering for GG. It told that it is upper case character but if we enter small G then it will say that it is lower case and if we enter percentage.If you enter this character then it will tell you that it is not an English letter. So in this way we can make our entire program which is checking whether it is upper case or lower case. Many good programs can be made in this. We have practiced some questions which are standard questions which are asked in the questions of your college in placement. Apart from this, you must have been given homework problems. You have to solve them on your own. If you are not able to solve the question then on your own.We have to take a little help from the notes, very easily we have completed this very important and very crucial chapter and after this we will move towards our fourth chapter in which we are going to cover the loops. Hi everyone and now we are going to start our chapter four which is named Loop Control Instructions. Inside this we are going to read what is for loop, what is while loop, what is do while loop and also we will discuss that two.Keywords break and continue, how are they used? How to use them. Now what are loop control instructions inside our code and why do we need them? Let us understand it with an example. Suppose we have to print Hello World inside the code. So what will we do? Simply write a print F statement in which we will write Hello World. Now suppose we have to print Hello World five times. Then you will No problem, we will simply copy and paste this line once, paste it again and again, so in this way we will get Hello World printed on our screen five times. But if I say that I want to print Hello World a thousand times or 10000 times or 1 lakh times, then what will happen in that case. In that case, we will not be manually sitting and doing control c control v i.e. the copy paste method.Yes, that will be very slow and it will take us days and if I tell you that we can finish the same task of printing the Hajj Line Hello World within three lines, then you will ask me, Didi, what is this trick in coding, then in coding, if we have to do any work again and again, again and again, then we use loops for that, like there is a code of five lines, instead of writing it again and again, we use a loop.We use simple small instructions and we call these instructions loop control instructions. Loop means in English to make something repeat again and again. Like in childhood, we used to listen to songs on the phone, then what we used to do, we used to make our playlist of favorite songs and keep listening to them, that is, the same four five songs are playing again and again or some people still use spotify.com, a basic thing which we need to remember.That is, whatever we can do with the for loop, we can do all those things with the while loop and we can also do all those things with the do while loop, that is, all these three loops work the same but their syntax will be a little different. Now my favorite syntax is the for loop, so whenever I have to use it in the code, I mostly use the for loop. We need all three, but whichever you find easier to learn, you can use them.You can use one repeatedly in your codes, there will be no problem, all the work can be done with one of these three loops, but all three have to be remembered, firstly because in the college exam, if the teacher has asked that you answer this question and you have to answer it only through the for loop or only while loop, then there can be a problem at that time. So in that case, the syntax of all three should be known. First of all, let s talk about the for loop. Now the syntax of the for loop is something like this.It happens in which first of all we write our keyword which is for, after that we put the parentheses and then these curly braces, like at the time of if, we had observed that there are some conditions, then our curly braces come and whatever work has to be done, we were writing in between. Something similar happens in the for loops. The first condition that comes in the for loop is the first condition that comes in the parentheses, we call this initialization.Condition means for any work we will be starting from here like if we have to print Hello World five times then we will take a variable which will track how many times Hello World has been printed then the value of that variable can start from our row can go up to four or the value of that variable can start from one and can go up to five so what will that variable do like we can take a variable i and what this i will do is the first of all.If the value is one, then it will count one, then two, then two, then three, then four, then five, and as soon as one occurred, Hello World was printed. As soon as two occurred, Hello World was printed. Three, Hello World were printed. Four, Hello World were printed. In five, it also printed Hello World. Now its initial value is i 1. This statement is the initialization statement which comes here.Our condition can be second. The condition tells us when to end this for loop, that is, when our work will be completed, like here we had written that int, we take a variable i whose value we start from one and in every task, inside our for loop, inside the for loop, we will be printing here what Hello World and here instead of the condition, we will write the condition in which our loop should run, then we want our loop to run then.Then run when the value of our i is less than equal to 5, then if our less than 5 is 5 or equal to 5 then you keep printing hello world and as soon as the greater than 5 becomes 5, do not print hello world anymore. Because we have printed it five times and in the updation statement, we write our variables or if we are going to do any updation in the loop, like here we can write i i 1. Every time we will increase the value of i by one. If we increase the value of i by one, then how will this loop be controlled? First of all, i will start with one, then the condition of that one will be seen whether i 5, yes, then it will go inside the loop.If there is any work, it will do it, after that it will come here to update. Now the value of i has become two, the value of i has become two, the condition will be checked again. The condition is that i 5. Is it yes because the value of two is less than five? Now it will never go to this initial iteration again, so after this condition is checked, it will work again, then it will be updated again. Two to three, after that it will check the condition again, then it will work again, then again again.It will be updated three to four times and then the condition will be checked again. So in this way our for loop keeps running in this circle. Once we actually write it in the code and see how we will do it, first of all we will write for for. Our key word is for loop. After that we will write the initialization statement i.e. int i 1. In a way, we have written a mini statement. Inside our for loop, there is a combination of three mini statements.First of all, our for loop will come in the initial statement which we have initialized i to is, after that we will write our condition under which condition, if our loop runs then there is a condition of i 5, then we will write update. In update, we can write i i 1 and here what we can do now is we will print F. Hello world, let s save it and let s run it once and see what is the output. We have the output that is.This is Hello World, after that once again our Hello World has been printed. Now we want each Hello World to be printed in the next line, so let s save this and compile and run again. This time Hello World has been printed for us five times. Suppose if we had to print it 1000 times, then nothing, just change this five to 1000. Make a simple change inside our for loop and we can do any task any number of times.You can do this, you will see that when I scroll it, it is getting scrolled on top and Hello World is actually printed on the screen a thousand times. So if any work has to be done many times, then we can use for loops and now suppose I have to print the numbers from one to 100, then how will I get them printed with the help of loop. Now, if I have to print the numbers with the help of loop, then there will be some fashion of this method, when first comes one, then two, then three again.Then 5 6 and in this way our numbers till 100. Now what we have already done is that we have taken a variable inside which the values are getting updated, so why don t we print the value of this variable i again and again. So if we print the value of this variable, then here we will write percentage d and after that i, we will change this 1000 to 100. I hope that the meaning of this is clear to all of us.What is happening is that the value of the variable i is starting from one and will go till 100 and every time the value of i is increasing by one, so what we will do here is that we are going to print the values from one to 100, so all these values from one to 100 have been printed on the output screen. Now we can also decrement this variable, meaning updating does not always mean increasing the value of the variable.Meaning, we can also reduce the value of the variable, like if I had to print values from 100 to 100 or let s say from 10 to 1, then I would start the value of i from 10 and then keep increasing the value of i till it gets reduced by one less than 10 to one. Every time I will update in the form of i i 1 and will run the loop till i is our greater than equal.T is not 1, meaning if the value of i is one then the loop will still run. If the value of i is two then the loop will still run. Even if the value of i is three then the loop will run and how is the loop running? First of all the value of i is 10, after that it will become nine, after that it will become eight. After that it will become seven. 6 5 4 3 2 1 As soon as one is updated, the value after one will become zero. After that this loop will not run. Now let s save it once and run it. This time our values will be printed.They will be printing after 10 i.e. 10 9 87654321 So in this way, we can increase or decrease this variable of ours at the time of updation. Now it is not necessary that the initialization done here should always be of an integer value. Here we can write characters as well, we can also write strings. Basically, we build our own logic. Whatever is required for initialization according to the question, we will do it but mostly here thisNow comes income itself, we either call it iterator, we can also call it item mater or else we call it counter variable, it means a variable with the help of which we are getting any work done again and again, then item mation means doing any work repeatedly in English. It is a counter or a counter. Just like we keep track of the counters above the shops, how many customers have come, similarly here is it a counter or a counter?It is a matter which is tracking how many times the work is done, if we write 10 here and here the condition says that work should be done till it is greater than one and the update condition says that it should be reduced by one, then we know that our counter is telling us, our iterator is telling us that our loop is going to run 10 times. Now let s ask a question on for loops. Question of ours is this print the number from 0 to 10. We need to row from 10 to 10.We will look at this question carefully because till now we were printing numbers from one to 10, this time zero is also additional and if we count all these numbers, then these are total 11 numbers. Here is a small confusion which happens to the students in the initial stages. They think that from zero to 10 we have 10 numbers but actually it is not so, we have 11 numbers.From zero to 10, now we will write its code. For the code, first of all, let s create our item meter. It is our item meter. Now we will start the value from zero. We have made it equal to zero. Now here we will put the condition that the value of i is equal to our value of 10, that is, whenever i is less than 10 or equal to 10.Till then let our loop run and for update we will write i i 1, every time it has to be increased by one and here we will get the percentage d i printed, put it here in the next line, save it and run it and here we have our output in which all our values from row till 10 have been printed, so in this way we have total 11 numbers printed. Now this i i 1 is right.There is a short hand to write it i.e. we can also write it i p, like we had learned that if we have to write i i 1, then we can write it as i e 1. We had learned this short hand while doing assignment operators. Now for i 1, we can also write i p, then it becomes the short hand of the short hand and this is only for va, that is, if there was a two here and there was a two here, then for that iPs ps plus we cannot do i p plus means add one to i every time. In the same way there is also a plus p aa. Plus p aa p p aa has a different meaning. Apart from that there is also minus minus aa and i is also minus minus. Now let us discuss this plus plus and minus minus thing in a little detail. We call them increment and decrement operators. First of all.Let s do increment of our increment operator which means to increase something i.e. to increase in English. So there are two types of increment operators. One is our P P A and one is our i P. If we take a variable i as its value then we write the print statement once in which we want to print the value of i some percentage d s n. Now we first write i plus plus do this.Let s take save and new terminal, then in our output we have one. After this aa, whenever we put plus plus, it means that first use the value of i and then increase the value of i, that is, whenever plus plus is used later, it means use then increase. First use whatever value is there and increase it. What was the value of aa? Now, using it first means getting it printed, so we have one.Got it printed but now this value has been increased with the internal compiler i.e. now if we again check the value of i If you want to print i, this time we will not do plus plus, this time we will simply write i, so here the value of i was printed as one, now by becoming plus plus, internally that value has become two and here when we will print i again, we will know how it has become two. Let us compile it. Run i.e. earlier it was one, now it has increased internally, not used, after that it is used again in this second line, if it is used.The value which was two got printed to us and right here, if we had taken aa for the same variable, then what would have happened in that case aa says increase then use i.e. first increase then increase the value, hence plus plus has already been told plus plus means first increase and then use the value of i, then it will increase and later the value of i will be used, we comment it out once and save and end.Now after running and looking at the output, first of all two was printed and second time also two was printed. Why because initially the value of i was one. What Plus Plus did was to first increase it to two, after that we got i printed i.e. two got printed. So at the second time when we are getting the value of i printed, it has already become two, that is why two got printed there also, so what happens is plus p aa, we call it pre increment operator and i p.We call it post increment operator so plus pi means pre increment i.e. first incremented and later used and post increment i.e. first used and later increased so in this way we can write short hand for p and 1. Now in the same way we have decrement operators. What does decrement operator do? It decreases the value i.e. here if we have minus minus then we call it pre.Decrement and there happens aa minus minus so we call it post decrement. Now as an example let s do it here as comment out and comment so the value of aa is one in the beginning. Now here we do i minus minus then what will be the output. We have the output is one and then row i.e. first of all the value of i will be used. If it is one then only one is printed. After that if there is decrement then the value of one will be printed.It will be decremented and when we print the second time we will have row. Now let s comment on this. If we run the second part i.e. minus aa then in this case first of all we will have zero printed because it will be decreased and then it will be printed so here also zero. Here also zero because the first time decrement got converted from one to zero and after that it got printed i.e. that zero itself got printed and the second time when printedIf the value of i is already zero then it will be printed as zero, then in this way our post decrement pre decrement post increment post increment pre increment operators work inside c and whenever we use loops, these increment decrement operators are very useful for us because mostly you will see that they are being used anywhere syntax wise, so we always have to use them which is the standard way forMostly people either use the variable a or useWe have discussed what is decrement operator, after this comes the question of loop counter can be float and even character, that is, in the for loop that we have written till now, our counter in the loop, which was a counter variable, can also be a float, it can also be our character. How, for example, we write a loop in which we want to print numbers from one to five, but this time, if we want to print floating numbers, then we will start the value of i from 1.0 and till i till ourLane is not equal to 5.0. Here we will make i plus plus and every time we will print the value of percentage f s n aa, save it and open a new terminal and run it, so what we print is 1.00 2.00 3.0 4.0 and this is In this way 5.0 means this time all the value has been printed in the slot and this time the iterator that we have used as our counter variable is a floating value along with it, suppose we have to print the characters from a to z, then what will be its loop, in the beginning we will take the character iterator i a, what will we do after that, will we put the condition or here instead of i, this time we take a different variable, if we take s, then i inside the character.The key value is stored and we will keep increasing s until its value is less than equal to z. We will make s plus plus every time. We know that the characters which are internally converted to their ESCA values are only numbers. If you scroll on a then its s key value is 97. If you scroll on z then its value is 122. So what will happen to b. A is 97 b.It will be 98, so if we keep increasing in this manner, then whenever we are increasing the character, that is, we are going from a to b, from b to c, from c to d, here every time we will get our character printed. If we save our character as C, then this time we will see that all the letters in our English alphabet have been printed from A to the end. So, in this way, whatever is our item, we can also take it as a character.We can also take it as int, we can also take double, it depends on what problem we are solving. The next thing we will talk about is int with infringing i 1. Our condition is done. Now here is our termination condition and you thought that you will leave it blank here, that means we will not write any statement here which will terminate this loop and here we will write our update statement i.e. i p and every time.What is this loop doing? Every time this loop is printing it, we have Hello World, let s save it. So what does this loop say that the value of i is starting from one, every time the value of a is increasing, that is, first there is one, then it will become two, then it will become three, then it will become three, then it will become four, then it will become five. But here we have left this statement blank as per our wish, we can leave any of the three blank. The problem is this.Errors come and what errors come. Now we will see. If we left this statement empty, then this loop is not knowing. The C compiler is not knowing when to end this loop. This loop will keep going on and on. How will it keep going on? If we run it, then this loop will keep printing Hello World until the memory of our computer is completely filled, so that is why we closed it. That is why it is important that we always do not miss any condition.As long as we know that our code is running properly and we have to pay a lot of attention as to which condition is going to do what and this kind of loop which never ends keeps on running forever, we will make it infighting, it will not stop infighting, whether we will create apps in web development related or anything else or go to the company and actually go and develop, then when you have to do coding there, then such mistakes are very basic mistakes which you should not make at all.Talking about loops, always keep in mind that you have created a loop inside your program, so this is our loop, that is our while loop. Now the syntax of writing the while loop is a little easier. In the beginning, we have done the code with the least difficult syntax, for loop. Now all the loops will seem easy to us, the rest of the things will seem very easy, but if you still have a little doubt in the for loop, then rewind it a little and see the questions which we discussed.If you have any doubts in them, then look at them a little, otherwise, look at the notes and understand it very well. Now let s read the while loops. The syntax of while is that first of all we write our keyword while and inside it we write our condition and then inside we write those statements which will do some work for us. So in the code we had just written that we have to print the numbers from one to four, we had already written the code in the for loop.Now once we compare the syntax of for and while, how was the code written in the for loop? for int i 1 aa till len is equal to 5 aa ps ps. Here we were printing the percentage d of our i. Now the same is true. What will be the conversion in the while loop? Then we will write our key keyword while. What is our condition? Here, our variable has to be declared outside, that is, inside our code, in for, we had declared the variable inside the parenthesis, but this time we have to declare the variable outside here because there is no space in while. Either you put it inside the while, but then it cannot be used here, in the condition, it must be outside.We will declare that our condition will be that till the lesson becomes equal to 5, print the percentage d, the value of our i. Now here you will ask, Didi, we have covered two things, here one, we have covered our declaration statement. If we write the declaration outside the Y loop, then this declaration has come in place of this declaration. Here, our termination condition has come that in which cases our loop should end.In which cases will it run, the termination condition has come here and it has come here but this updation condition has not come. Where will we write the updation? So we have to write the updation inside the while loop, that is, in the end statement, we will write the updation here, before the end of the loop, if the income is also changed to plus plus while coming out in the end, then next time the plus plus will change from the statement to and then it will come back again, it will do the work, then again it will become plus and then back again.Will work, then it will become plus plus again, then it will come back again. So, our loop runs in this manner. Now let s actually run our code inside c. Now let s check the actual running of our code. Declare variables int aa e e 1 until i is equ 5. Till then we print hello world five times and every time we will make i plus plus. Now one thing to be noted is these curly braces, after these, anytime, ever inside c.We do not put this i.e. statement terminator because curly braces mean that there is a block of code, after that we already know that the statement is about to end, so there is no need to put statement terminator. Now let s run the new terminal, so we have got Hello World printed five times. Now let s talk about its questions. Our question is print the numbers from 0 to n if n is given by the user. What were we doing till now, from row to five likeIf we want to print the numbers up to or from one to five, then we were manually putting the terminating statement that as long as the value of i is less than equal to 5, but this time the user will tell us till where the value has to be printed like for example if the user sent us four then we have to print 1 2 3 4 If the user sent 10 then we have to print 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 WhenTill 10 is not reached, now what will be the way to do this? First of all, we will take value input from the user. We took the value input from the user, stored it in some variable n, stored it in the number n. Now whenever we used to write the for key condition or what do we do in this case, we solve the question with while loop. Earlier, whenever we used to write the condition of while, what will we write inside the while until our i equal to n. First we used to write lesson.Equal to 5, in this case n is a changing number, it cannot always be five, it can be four, it can be 10, it can be 10000 also, then lane equal n, inside that we will print our i and later we will make it i p, so our process will be something like this, let us code it and check it, then write above, print F, enter number and make your number above, define int n and scan from here.Now we will write our while loop while while one iter r int i e as long as our i equal to n then our while loop will run. What will we do inside the while loop? We will print our value every time i.e. our i and after that we will do i . So what happened is that first of all we asked the user for the number.The while loop will run every time, we will print it and then update it by one. Let s save it and run it. So first of all we have to enter the number number. We are going to enter seven. Seven, we have entered it, so all the numbers from row to seven have been printed for us. Now here we could have also entered any big number like suppose we have entered 55 then row. We have printed all the numbers from 1 to 55, so the only way to learn For Loops or any concept in C well is to do a lot of its questions. If we are clear about the things we are practicing, then there is no problem. We can use the same code with for instead of while. How to do it here. Comment out and write the same code in for. For int aa 0 aa.Until the value of i is less then equal to n, we have n. Here we will write our print statement percentage d n aa. So just like here the value of aa was the first row and the condition was being checked here, similarly in the for loop the value of i is the first row. We have put the condition until i n and for update i p and every time we are printing the value of i then thisNow let s save it once and run it. Now after entering the number, we have six, so all the numbers from row to six have been printed. Now suppose we do not want to do it from zero. We have to print it from one to six. No problem, take the value of this i as initialism. If we want to print it from three to six or from three to seven, from three to n, then do the initialization statement. Get it done from three to n, then in any way in this way.The code will be in that way we will be adopting and overcoming. Next thing we will talk about is our do while loop. Do while loop is exactly like the while loop. Now the condition inside the while loop is already checked i.e. if we talk about the while loop then what used to happen in the while, first while while was written then our condition was written. So if this condition is false then we would never be going inside this block like int aa e.Equal to, we have written one and the condition is being checked, i is equal to then else and will never be true, that is why the statements inside will never be executed, otherwise our while loop will not run even once, but if we write such a while loop which will always run once in the list, we call it do while, then there are different cases of do while loop in which using it makes more sense. If we talk about the syntax,If we do then in do while, first of all we write do, that is, here the condition is not checked first, the work is done first, do do, first do the work, first of all, whatever work is done by writing do, we can write our own lines here, then in the last the condition will be checked, that is, we have to keep doing this work as long as the work is done first, then the condition will be checked, then the work will be done, then the condition will be checked, then we will write in the end, then we will write our condition in the parentheses and here weYou must be putting statement terminator because there is no block here, there is parentheses, statement terminator can come after parentheses, hence it has come here, so this is our syntax. Now if we have to write the code to print the numbers from one to five, then at the top, we will define our variable i 5, after that we will write in do do, tell our work, what is the work, to print the value of i, we will write the value of this variable.Print statement print f percentage d b n i and now we have to tell the condition. This work has to be done till the value of our i remains equal to 5 and here we will put the condition of updation in between i.e. i p. So we have written this i 1 to 2 3 4 5. The code to print these five numbers is also run once. First of all we will write doo doo, what will it do?Now we should have the variable ready to work, so let s initialize it with one. Our work is to print the variable, so to get it printed, we will write percentage d n i and then we will write our while in while, then we will write the condition, what is our condition, until the value of i remains equal to 5 and then our statement terminator, we will keep printing i and every time iWe will convert i into plus plus because if i is not plus then what will become of us again? So the value of i will always be less than f, hence every time the condition will be true, the loop will run. Every time the condition will be true, if the loop will run, then by going to one of the infindings, after running run, we got the output 1 2 3 4 5. Here, the values have to be printed from f to one, so what do we do by initializing i and writing it here with fv.i becomes my minus termination statement i As long as greater than is equal to 1, we save it and run, now it is printed 54321, so in this way we can use increment decrement, from where to where we have to go, we can understand its code, so this was our do while loop, our question says print the sum of first n natural numbers, so first of all they will print the first part, after that they will be looking at the second part, so we have to print the sum of the first n natural numbers.Like every time, the user will give us this n, then we will print their sum. Suppose the user has given n 4, then we have to print the sum of all the numbers from one to 4. We will have 10. If the user has given five, then the same is from one to five. We will have to print the sum of all the numbers from one to five. If three has been given, then the same is 1 2 3 6. So how to do this, first of all, we know the most basic thing that the user will scan F.Take the input of our n, after that as soon as n input comes, after that we have to run a loop for loop. Suppose we run in which the value of aa starts with one and goes till our four or up to n and in that we will do i plus plus. Now what is our work, the work is to write the work inside the loop. The work is to calculate our sum. So we will create a variable sum and initialize the value of this sum with row, that is, in the beginning the sum is our row and add inside this sum.If i 1 then one is added to the sum. If i 2 then 2 is added to the sum. If i 3 then 3 is added to the sum. So by doing this we will get the sum of all the values inside the sum like the value of i is one in the beginning.After updating, we have the value of to sum. Now what will happen inside the one loop is sum i equal to sum i i.e. 1 2 i.e. 3. Now the value of i will become th. The value of sum will become th. What will happen inside the loop is sum sum i 1 2 3 6. So our process will be something like this. Once we write the code, we will discuss it again. What will we do in the beginning? First of all, we ask for a number from the user.Enter number, create a variable int n, store it inside n, then scan if percentage d and n. After that, create another variable. Sum will initialize the value of sum with zero and create one. In the for loop, we will write i 0 or i 1 i until our equation n remains i p and inside this loop, we will add sum to sum as sum i or we can write this as sum e.i And what will we do in the end, we will print the value of our sum, so the sum is percentage d aa, let s save it and let us run it, here we are going to print the value of the sum, not the aa, in the end, we will enter number number, we enter three, then we have the sum printed and come six. If we suppose we are entering five, then this time we entered five, the sum got printed and came 15, so what was the process in this method.First we entered n and then created sum variable whose value we initialized with row. After that we ran a loop from one to n. What we used to do every time was to print the item mater of the loop. But this time we did something else with that item i.e. calculated our sum. How to calculate the sum. Sum Sum i i.e. every time we kept adding that i to the sum, then the sum of all the i s was found out and then printed.Got the value of our final sum done in the same way. First of all if i was 1 and the sum was row then first of all sum sum i so our sum became one. Then if i was 2 then the sum became one. As soon as we went inside the loop the value of the sum became three. Then i increased and became three. The value of the sum was already three. Now if three was added inside the sum then the sum finally became six. So this would be the answer for our n 3. Now the second part of this question says this.Also print them in reverse i.e. we have printed the numbers from one to n, the numbers which we have taken sum, also print those numbers in reverse, how to print them in reverse, let s make another separate loop for that, if suppose we have printed the sum, now for int i n i until our greater than is equal to 1 i minus and every time we will print f, the percentage d n of our i. Now the first thing to note is that our i wasWe have also declared here If int i 1 and here also declared int i 1 then will there be an error, the compiler will say that you have declared the same variable twice, we had learned that this is wrong, then here the error will not come because whatever variable we declare here inside the for loop, its value remains only till that for loop, that is, as you must have seen, in the beginning, instead of even, I tried to print i here.But the value of my i is only inside this block. I cannot use my aa outside this block, so outside this block the compiler does not know what aa is, that is why i cannot be used here, here only even can be used, that is why the life time of i ended here, so here the compiler does not know what aa is, so we can declare a new variable aa again, which we did.The value of i is initialized with n i.e. if n is ti then i will be three in the beginning. n5 will be n5 in the beginning then our condition statement is this until i 1 i is minus minus and after that we are printing i. So we save it and run. So this time if we have given three then first of all the sum will be printed on six, after that from three to one in reverse count means reverse.All our numbers in the order will be printed to us. Now all this work is done, what we did in two for loops, we could have done the same in a single for loop, how can we do it in common doubt and here what we do is create another new variable j n, so in this way we can initialize multiple variables inside the for loop, so i 1 and j n. Now here i e equ n until end and ourAs long as j is greater than equal to 1 and every time we are doing plus plus to i then we will make j minus minus and get it printed every time. Now we can remove our j inside this for loop complete. Now let s listen carefully what happened inside it. Already we had a variable i whose value was starting from one. This time we inserted a new variable and named it j. The value of j we started n.The job of this aa will be to calculate the sum. The job of this j will be to print the numbers in reverse order. The condition of i is that i will print the numbers in reverse order till there is no less than n. The condition of j is that till there is no greater number n, things will be printed in the reverse order. So we know that till the time i goes from one to n, j will go from n to one. So, we have put an end here between both the conditions.That is, both of ours should be true. Every time we are making i plus plus because we are calculating the sum, then every time we can also make j minus minus because we are printing our numbers in reverse order. So now let s save this and let s run this. Now we have printed 3 2 1 and at the end the sum is six. What was happening earlier? The sum is six was printed first. The numbers were printed later this time.The numbers are printed first because till the time the sum is being completely calculated and then it is being printed, there is a statement of the numbers being printed before the sum is printed. Also, what can we do with this, we can also remove this income completely. If we remove the income completely, then what will happen to it, j which is ours, its value is going from n to 1. Now whether we take the sum of 1 2 3 or we take the sum of 3 to 1, the sum of both is ultimately six.If we are going to come close, then the value of the sum of both will be equal, hence whether we are going from one to n or from n to w in the loop, it will not matter if we are calculating the sum, here we will do sum sum j, then instead of 1 2 3, it will become 3 2 1, so if we save it once and run it, then we will get the same output, that is 3.To 1 and sum we will have the correct calculate that is six so this is the way our for loop works and different things we can do inside it now next if we talk about the question then the next question is print the table of a number input by the user user will be giving us a number we have to print the table of that like user has given two then two key we will print the table how will we print first two then four then six then 8 10 12 1416 18 20 If user gave us 42 So we will have to print the table of 42 which obviously I will not be able to do quickly. So what we have done till now is that we have written a for loop inside which we have told our condition i 1 i e n i and inside that what we used to do was print our i. We used to print i by printing i but this time we will not print aa. This time we will be performing some other function and what will be the function like for 2 we will also write 2 malla ba 1.We can write 4 as 2 Malla Ba 2. We can write 6 as 2 Ma Ba 3 because what is the whole of this table of two? Now let s see one thing, here this two is remaining constant but this is our variable, it is increasing, first there was one, then there was two, then 3 4 5 in the next 6 7 8 9 10 so this value is increasing.Obviously this number will not be our iterator. This number will be our iterator. It is the number whose value keeps changing and keeps getting updated. So, this number will be our iterator. So what will we do in this code. We will start the value of our iterator from one and take it till 10. We will take it till 10 and get it printed every time. Multiply the item number. So first the number will be multiplied by 2 1 and then it will be printed.It will be printed after multiplying by 2 2, then it will be printed after multiplying by 2 3 and in this way we will print the entire table of our numbers. For this we write the code. First of all we will enter our number. We have entered the number. After that we write a loop for int i 1 till our lesson is equal to 10. i 10 because we are considering the table from one to 10 and we will be printing it every time.Percentage d b n n aa number aa save it and run it, first of all if we enter the number two then the whole table of two will be printed to us. Now the computer will do the work which I could not do and will give it to us i.e. it will print the table of 42 and give it to me. So the whole table of 42 has been printed to us very quickly. So in this way, if we have to get the table of any number printed then we can get it printed with the help of C on our screen.On top of this, whenever math calculations are being done and the calculator is not around and the brain is not able to operate on its own, it would take us out, that is, it would make us exit from the entire block that was running, because of that, the condition of all the cases would not be turned on, that is why we have written break statement i.e. break wherever it is, its main meaning is that we have to exit the loop, now wherever we have to exit from the loop, we should write break like for.Example, if we have written a code, we have written a for loop inside which we are printing the numbers from one to five. for int i 1 i less equt 5 a p plus. Now in this we will print the percentage d b s a a. Now here if we write the condition in the middle if a i is equal to i equal to 3 i.e. as soon as a becomes three, this is the work of the if condition that it is checking as soon asOnce i3 is done, from here we do a break, that is, we come out of this entire loop and finally we get it printed and save it and run it once and analyze the output. We have one printed as 2 and end how it got printed. Earlier we had the value of i as one. As soon as the value of i was one, we went inside the loop. Is the value of i three or not? If it is not three then it will not be true. We have printed one and let it be i.The value of i got updated to i2, then this condition falls again, so we got two printed here, then the value of i got updated to three, as soon as the value of i became three, this if condition became true, then we came to the break, as soon as we came to the break, what does the break do, it causes exit from the loop, so we came out of this for loop completely and came here and we got it printed and i.e. the rest of the conditions were there or the rest.The update that was there, we did not see this statement, we did not see the termination condition, we did not see the updation, we did not see anything, being blind, we will completely come out of our for loop and then whatever is written outside, then we will execute it, then the work of break is when you have to cut your for loop or do loop, do Y loop or Y loop completely from the middle, whenever you have to come out of it completely, then we write break there.We will be completely broken from it, we will exit from it Let s do a question for this, the name of the question is Keep taking numbers as input from the user enters an odd number, so what we have to do in the question is that we have to keep taking input of some numbers from the user, like the user has entered 2 4 10 16 18 and then keep taking input of numbers from the user until the user enters an odd number, that is, if he has entered a seven, then here we will stop or break, till then we will keep taking input of numbers from the user.Now whenever we have to take some input from the user and run a condition for it, we always prefer do while loop, why do loop because right now what is our job is to take input from the user, we will take the input of the number only once, then we will be able to check it by putting some condition beyond that, that s why first do the work and then apply the condition, so here we try to build the logic a little bit of do while, rest you can do it in some way.We can also do this same question inside the loop. First of all, what we will do is create a do while loop, then we will write do and later we will write while. Now what we have to do inside this do while loop is to take the input of a number again and again. So above we define a variable int n. This is our number and every time inside our do loop, we will take the number from scanf inside the do loop. So in this way, every time.The number has come in the input and just for fun, we also get this number output. Percentage d, what number we have got, what is the number and what is the condition that we have to keep. In this case, either we can keep that as soon as our n is odd, our n becomes odd, we go out, but in this case, in the condition, we just write. What does it mean to write one in the one condition, we are writing true, every time the condition will be true, no matter what comes.We are always putting the number true inside our condition. Till now the loop we have made is this do while loop in a repeating manner until our condition fails but the condition will never fail because we have put one there but there is a way to avoid it inside that we break and how to break. We will break when our condition comes i.e. as soon as the user has entered an n which is an odd number. How to check the odd number n Percentage module 2 0 will come here not equal to 0. In that case we will break a little. Let us understand this. We have defined a variable end inside which we are going to take input of our number and then made a do y loop. First of all we are scanning our number. Above this we write another print statement. By entering the number, we have taken the number from the user, after that we have got that number printed back to see what the user had printed. After that we are checking.In this condition, we are checking whether that number is odd or even. That is, if n modulo two is not equal to zero, then that number is an odd number. As soon as an odd number comes, we will break it. That is, we have come out of the loop and after coming out at the end, we can get anything printed. Suppose we get it printed at the end. We thank you, then this do it yourself loop will continue till the time our user, who is the even number, keeps printing even numbers.Keep entering, let s save it and run it. Enter number two. Next time we entered two, it got printed. Now next time we enter four, four got printed. After this, we enter six. Six got printed. Enter 18. Enter 18. We enter 20, so 20 got here. But if we enter an odd number, three, we put it here.But it got printed, thank you and this is where our program ended. So in this way, we can create a loop which will be controlled by the user s input. So we are making changes according to whatever input the user gives us. We are running our loop accordingly. Now the next question which we will talk about is, keep taking numbers as input from the user unless a number is a multiple of seven, that is, we have to keep taking input from the user until the user enters such a number.Which is a multiple of seven, which comes in the table of seven, so it is very simple, exactly as we have written the code, it is exactly the same, we just have to change the values a little, then we will keep entering the numbers, what about breaking the condition as soon as n is equal to 7. If it becomes equal to 0, this condition means that the number n is a multiple of 7. Similarly, we will break it, so let s run it. Compile Run. First of all, we are entering six, the code is running. Entered three, it is running in three. Entered 12, it is running in 12 also, but as soon as I enter 14, thank you will be printed. Why the code ends here because 14 is our sen s.The multiple is 7 Ba 2 is 14, so here this model is equal to row, so from here we have done break. Break means no more lines of the loop have gone and whatever is written outside the loop will now start executing. Now one more special thing about break, break is ours, it also makes us exit from the nested loop, that is, you have written some things inside one for loop and inside that you have written your second for loop.Loop, some things are written inside it, so if break is written here, then it will take us out of this loop and also out of this loop and the statements here will be our run, so whenever we have to use break, we have to use it very thoughtfully as to how the control flow of your program is going to change. Next we will read about the continue statement. It is the opposite of break. Continue break says here stop all the work and move ahead. Continue says that s it.If we want to stop the current work and start the next work, then whenever we want to skip to the next iteration, whenever we want to skip to the next iteration, we write Continue, that is, all the lines of the current iteration will be deleted and will be run in the next iteration. Let us write an example of this. Things will be understood better by writing the code. For int i 1 i i le ect 5 i p plus. Now we will go from one to five.We want to print all the numbers but we hate the number three, it seems very unlucky not to print it. If we want to print all the others, then what can we write here. If first of all we write the print statement, we write the percentage of all our numbers, d b n and our number n or our number a and we check at the top. If our a is equal to two is equal to 3, then this unlucky number has come, ours.If we don t get it printed, in that case we will write Continue . If we had written break here, it means that we would have come out of this loop completely, then four and five would not have been printed, that is, three would not have been there, but then F is not there, but we have written Continue . Let s see what output comes from Continue . The output from Continue is 1 2 3. Ours has been skipped and 45 has come. So whenever we have to skip something, there is something special.We want to skip the set of lines, we want to skip them and want to go to the next item, then we use continue there. Continue says, continue further, let go of the current thing, leave the current thing, so this is the basic meaning of our continue. Now if we ask this question, then print all the numbers from one to 10 except for six, that is, all the numbers from one to 10 except six. How to print it?We will simply write here, in the bus condition, from one to 10, we will write in our skip condition, when i becomes 6, then skip or continue, then we run, then the output has come to us, numbers from one to f have come and numbers from sen to 10 have come, six has been skipped, we have not printed it. If we talk about the next question, print all the odd numbers from 5 to 50, this is our question.We have to print all the odd numbers that come between Pa and 50. To print, we write the code for int Aa 0 Aa is less than this time we will start with five instead of zero and Aa will be equal to 2 as long as 50 remains, we will make Aa plus plus every time. Now whenever our Aa is an odd number then we have to print it. If it is even then do not print it. There can be multiple ways to do this.You can also do this same question with the help of Continue. You can also do the same question in the reverse way i.e. in the way I will show you, there are multiple ways to do the same question with opposite conditions and when we are in the initial stage of programming then we must explore multiple ways. We have done one question in one way, now we have to try it in another way, first this is this. I had checked Qual to is equal to , now I try to solve the question by saying Not equal to . Whenever we do programming in this way, in the beginning, our creativity and logical power increases a lot because we are imagining multiple cases along with the same situation. When at the time of placement or at the time of college, you might have been given a coding question, what would be your corner cases in it?You will be able to imagine the condition statements very well where your code can get stuck. So let s move inside the question. First of all, we have to check whether our number is odd. What will we do to check the odd? If not equal to 0 then it means our number is odd. So here we will write our condition. What to do inside the condition. If it is odd then we will print it as percentage d n i otherwise else.What is to be done inside Else? There is no need to write Else inside Else because there is no need to do anything inside Else. We save it and run it from our terminal. The output we get is 5 7 9 11 and you will observe carefully. These are all odd numbers which exist between 5 to 50, so we can write the code in this way also. The next question saysPrint the factorial of a number n i.e. there is a number n. We have to print its factorial. First of all, let s talk about what is the thing called factorial. What is the factorial of any number? Multiply that number by decreasing from one to one. Like if we calculate the factorial of one, then one exclamation mark in math is called one factorial, then it will be one. If we take 2 factorial, then it will be 1 ld ba 2. If we take 3 factorial, then it will be.Will be 1 2 3 6 This will be 2 4 Factorial will be 1 m 2 3 4 24 5 Factorial will be 1 2 3 4 5 120 So this is how our factorials are calculated Now the multiplication here is either we can multiply from one to five or we can multiply from five to one MultiplyBy dividing one number with another number, the same output is obtained, that is, a b also remains the same, b a also remains the same, and the plus also remains the same. If there is no same in the minus and divide, then if we want to find the factorial of any number, then simply put a loop for it. Where should the loop start? Let it start from our number itself. Int should start from i 1 and go till n. From one to n, f will take it or from n to one or from one.If we have n then we will do i plus plus every time and we will take another variable. We will initialize the factorial factorial variable with one. When we did sum from one to the end, we initialize it with row. Why did we initialize it with one, it will become row, that is why whenever we have to take sum, if we want to initialize it with row, then we will multiply our number aa every time. This code is equal to the even code.It might seem similar to what we used to do in sum, sum i, here what we are doing is factorial factorial multiply by i and in this way the value of the final factorial will be the factorial of our number, so let us try this also. To code the code, first of all we have to create a number int n then we will print it enter the number after that we will scan our number as percentage d m percent n and now what we will do is run a loop.Before running the loop, let s define another variable int factorial 1. Now inside the loop, first of all we will initialize i with one i i n i p and what is the work of the loop is to calculate factorial then factorial i is equal to factorial multiply by i and at the end we will print the value of our final factorial. Final factorial is percentage d which is r fact. Now one thing factorial.What we have to be very careful about is that the value of factorial does not multiply but increases as if there is very little change in the sum. If you add five to 10 then the value will be just 15 which is a small value but if you multiply 10 with five then the value will become 50, hence if the factorial is there then it increases very fast i.e. almost exponentially, that is why your int isIf you are making a factorial of this integer data type, then there will be multiple numbers inside it. There will be less number of numbers which you will be able to store factorial i.e. if you give a big number in it like you want to calculate 50 factorial then in that case int will be very small so to store it you will have to use big data types and in some cases the factorial will become so big that no number data type will be able to store it, so there are different ways to do it, that is in your competitive programming or extreme DSA side.Same goes when you are storing factorial in a string, but in C, there are no strings, so your character array will be used. What are all these things, we will be studying in details in the upcoming chapters. For now, those coming from other languages will be understanding it better. Its basic is that when we run this program, we will not give big numbers but will calculate the factorial of small numbers to calculate factorial, then that will be our program.Now let s save this code here and let s run it. First of all let s calculate the factorial of three. The final factorial is six which is correct. Now if we want to run the factorial of 5 is 120, this is also correct. If we calculate the factorial of 6 then that is 720. Now suppose we are evil minded and we want to enter 50, then why will we cry because the final factorialThat number has exceeded, this data type could not be stored inside it, hence, do not test with big numbers. We can test with small numbers. The next question which we will talk about is print the reverse of a table for a number n, that is, the user will give us this number n. For this, we have to print the table but do not print the table directly. We have to do it in the reverse order, like the user has given n 2, then we will print 20 then 18 16 14 12 10 8 6.4 2 In this manner, if we want to print the table in the reverse order, then nothing, earlier what we used to do was write 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4. This time we will start with 2 10 and then 2 9 2 8. And in this way, this is what it is, this will become our iter for our loop and every time we will decrease the value i.e. i minus minus. We would have written the code for this also.We will get the user to enter the numbers and after that we are going to print our number table. So for int, this time we will initialize our item meter with our numbers or sorry, initialize the item meter with 10 and then i till the greater than equal to 1 will go i minus minus and every time we will be printing the percentage d by n number multiplied by i. Let s save it and let s run it.We will enter our number two, then the complete table of two has been printed to us, starting from 20 and ending at two, so in this way we can print the tables in reverse order also. The last question which we will be discussing in this chapter is called Calculate the Sum of All Numbers Between 5 and 50 including 5 and 50 i.e. 5 and 50 also.We have to count the sum of all the numbers from five to 50. We have to calculate it and get it printed on the screen. How to get it printed? Let s remove this part and take a variable int sum 0. This time the initial iteration will be from five and where will it end till the lesson becomes equal to 15 and at the end we will do i and here we will do sum sum i or its short hand is written i and at the endWe will print the percentage d i of the sum. Let s save it. Once we analyze the code a little, we initialized the sum with zero. We started our loop with five and ended it when the value of i becomes 50. Gradually we increased it one by one. First it was five, then it became six, then it became seven, then it became eight. Every time we will add the value of aa inside our sum, i.e. 5 6 7 8.Till we reach 50 and at the end we will print the value of our sum, save it and run it to see if we compile it, then the sum of all the numbers from 5 to 50 comes to us as 1 2 6 5. And those students who are in doubt can sit and calculate it manually themselves or do it, that would be a good way to verify your code, so for now, that s it.I hope that the practice questions are sufficient because I think that when I tried my If I had read the exam or I had sat for the placement, then by this time we would have understood this chapter in a sufficient manner and we would have been able to do the homework problems very well on our own. If we are still having doubts, then once again we need to do a little recap on the lecture. I have tried my best to cover all the important concepts and the important things where mostly students make mistakes.I have tried to discuss the problems completely and along with that I have tried to explain those concepts very well. Now after this we can take a slight pause, take a slight break, drink some water and come back and solve our homework problems and after this we are going to move towards our chapter five and now we are moving towards our chapter five which is named Functions and Recurs now.Functions are a very important topic whenever we talk about any language. Function, which is like loops or like our conditional statements, comes in the concept of basic core programming, which is teaching you the concepts of core programming, which you will be applying not only in C but also in other languages. Along with this, if we talk about recurses, then inside C we will be seeing a very simple form of recurses in which if ever youWhen college students ask questions or placement questions, many of them will ask you basic questions related to C, but we get to see the real power of Reconcion when we are learning data structures and algorithms, whether they are learned in C P or whether they are learned in Java. Now whenever we learn data structures and algorithms, there are some complications in it like trees have come, graphs have come and many other things like you.That function is implemented with the help of keys, so first of all let s talk about what the functions actually are. If we have ever watched TV while sitting at home in childhood, nowadays all the social media used to go back the channel from A, there was a mute button to mute the TV and a power button to turn the TV on or off. Now if we compare the remote of that TV with C s own program, then there will be different buttons in it, each button will have a function.There is such a part of the code inside the function C which does some work for us, it takes some input from us and then does the work and then gives some output, like if we talk about the button of the remote, we pressed it, we gave it input, then it changed the channel for us or increased the volume, it did the work or we can call it output, output, it is not giving us anything extra, in the same way our functions work inside C and the functions are very powerful like the functionIf we talk in simple language or in the language which you will write in your exam, then function is a block of code that performs a particular task, that is, a function is a block of our program, it is a part which performs a particular task and for the sake of simplicity, the work of a function is only one, like if there is a function which has to increase the volume, then it will only increase the volume, it will not reduce the volume or it will not change the channel.Whose job is to mute the TV, it will just mute the TV, it will neither increase nor decrease the volume. In this way, every function of C has one task and it does the same work. We do not try to get it to do other tasks, otherwise our program becomes complex. Now if we understand the function with the help of a diagram, then the function does some work for us. First of all, it takes some arguments from us. Arguments, that is, it takes some inputs, the input parameters of these parameters.On the basis, it does some work for us and returns a result to us in the output. Now the major use of functions is inside C or any programming language because it can be used multiple times, meaning we can use the same function again and again. We can press the volume button on the TV remote any number of times or press the button to change the channel or the power button, we have used it millions of times.If you have watched a lot of TV, you must have switched it on and off, then a function is a part that does one thing. With this, the same work can be done as many times as we want. The second property is that it increases code reuse ability. If we see in our code, this is the rule of thumb that I do that if within the code, the same thing has to be done three times, more than three times, then make it a function. Suppose we have to print Hello World. If we have to print Hello World three times or more than that, then what to do.If we make a function of it, then whenever we call the function, that thing will be happening automatically, that is why instead of writing a big code again and again, what we can do is simplify it into a small function, due to which the reusability of the code increases. Now how do we actually write the function in C? There are some syntaxes of the function. The process of writing the function is usually a three step in normal cases.The process takes place, the first of which is the syntax of the function prototype. What is the meaning of function prototype? This is the line due to which we are telling the C compiler that we are going to write a function. The C compiler should know what things are written inside the program. So with the help of this line i.e. with the help of this prototype, we tell that we are going to declare a function, so it is also called function prototype or function declaration.Now what is the syntax of writing this? The syntax is that this is print hello, this is the name of our function. The name of our function can be anything because it is like the name of a variable, it is user defined, like what does our function do, our function prints hello, we have learned this, that is why we named the function print hello. If it prints the average of two numbers, then we could have named it average or print average.We could have named our function according to whatever work it does, so here we named it print hello and after writing the function, two parentheses are always required, so we put two parentheses here, after that we put the statement terminator. Now this is what we have written as void. Writing this void means that our function will not return anything in the result, that is, it will do the work but we will not get any value at the end, that is why we have void void.In English it means empty, so void is written here, meaning this print hello function will print hello but will not return any value. Now this line which is print hello, before that void and then the parenthesis, this tells the compiler that one of our functions exists. This is the syntax of the declaration. The second syntax that we are talking about is the definition of the function. Once we have told the compiler that our function exists, after that weYou will have to write the function, then show somewhere how the function works, then we call that statement. Function definition and its syntax is this. First of all, we write the return type, i.e. what value it will return, what is its type, so it will not return anything here, that is why void is written, then we will write the name of our function print hello, then we will write parenthes, after that will come our curly braces, so this is the block inside which all our code will exist.Here, because we only have to print hello, we will write a single line, print A, inside which we will write hello, so in this way our function definition is also covered. Now the third syntax that we talk about is function call. What does a function call do? We told the compiler that we want to create a function, then we also created the function. Now how to use this function, the work done to use the function is called function call, i.e. calling the function.So how the statement is written for that, we can either call the function from int main or from any other function, so here we are calling another function from main function, we will write the name of our print hello function, we will write parentheses, we will put terminator, then this will become our calling statement which we have written inside int main. Now if you look carefully, our main is also a function whose return type is int because int.value return It does not return int value i.e. it returns zero, after that its name is main but main is a keyword, the rest are the names of all the functions which we will create and all will not be keywords, after this comes the parentheses, this is our curly braces and inside this is all its block of code. So in this way, just like the main function, we are going to create other functions which will be working as per our wish. First of all, a function for an example.If we write it, we have the boiler plate code in which we already have the header file above, below is the int main, return zero, we are creating our print hello function, at the top we will tell the compiler that we have created the function, how to tell void print hello, after that we will be actually creating our print hello. We are creating this print hello below our main function, now we are creating it above also, but whenever we create above, you do not need to tell it separately.But by the way, the syntax is a bit traditional. Following the traditional way of writing, we will be creating our functions below the main. Inside this class, we will write void print hello, after that, Panis, then our curly brace. Now compare this print hello with this main function, so first of all it has a return type, so it also has a return type, meaning main returns our integer, print hello does not return anything, its name is main, its name is print hello.After this, we have put Pansies in both of them and curly braces in both of them and inside the print hello we will be doing our work which is print F world, so in this way our print hello function prints hello to us from hello world or let s save it. Now how to call print hello low means how to get hello printed. So our calling will be done here, here we will write print hello, the name of our function, then pansies and then terminator.So this is our declaration or function prototype, this is our function call and the main thing here is our function definition, let s save it and run it once, compile and run from the terminal, then hello has been printed for us, here is the next line. Now if we want, instead of writing print F again and again, we can print this hello again and again. How to call the function, so we called the function once, now we call the function again.In fact, we call our function three times, save it and run it, so what happened to us is that Hello is printed three times. Now we can get the work done by our function any number of times. Now here we have seen a very simple example, what it does is just write a print statement, but inside this function, we can write any number of lines like 10, 20, 25 and we will not have to repeat those lines again and again inside our main function.We will have to write only the name of our function there, so in this way the reusability of our code increases, we do not have to write many lines, our code becomes small and is very systemic because every chunk which should do the work tells us the name of our function, so the programming in this way becomes very simple. We may not see its benefit yet, but when we go to write big codes inside companies, there are thousands of lines of code there.If there are functions there, they help us a lot. Now inside this function, we can print anything. Suppose we are getting it printed. Apart from this, my name is Shata and the next line. So now we have two lines inside this function. Now we call it again, we will see that the same thing has been printed three times for us, but the function call has remained the same, that is, if we have to make any change, like what the volume button used to do earlier, volume button one will do it.By increasing it, it used to change from two to three, but we want the volume button in our remote, which is one to become three, from three to five, to skip two or two, then now we do not need to change it on the call. Now we will go into the complete definition and change it so that the user does not have to make any difference. If he just has to press the button like before, then this is also an advantage of writing the functions. Now let us solve some questions in which we can describe different functions.You must be looking at their properties by writing. The first question in this is Right to Fun. In question one to print hello and second to print good bye. In the question we have to write two functions. First of all we will create a function which prints hello, then we will create a function which prints good bye. So let s cross it. We have already created a function print hello which prints hello. Now what will we do? We will create a function which will print good bye. So above first we have to tell the compiler void print good bye. We are going to create a function.After we told the compiler, we actually make that function void print good bye and here we will write the print statement good bye. So we created a function named print hello. We created a function named print good bye. Inside the hello we are printing hello. Inside the good bye we are printing good bye. We have mentioned the prototype of both the functions above. After that, just like we were calling hello, we can also call print good bye.Here we will write print goodbye and save it and run, so first of all we called hello, then hello was printed, then we called goodbye, then goodbye was printed. The function which is called first is executed first, then later we will call the function which will be executed later, that is, how will our method of execution be? First of all, we will always start with the main function. We have come to the main function of the code.What did you do, if you call print hello, then all the rest of the code will stop for now, like people who have to walk, if they can go in front of the traffic, then there is a similar scene, here this function will stop completely and will call print hello, now the entire code of print hello will be run here, what does print hello do, does it print hello, we have printed hello on our screen, after that we will go back inside the main function.In the main function, we will start from where we had last ended i.e. we had called print hello, then we will start from here, this call is over, then we will call print good bye, then we will reach print good bye, then we will print good bye, then it will come to our console, after that we will come back inside the main. print good bye is over, now we will come to the return statement, we will return row row, that is, our main function is over, that means our program is over, in this way ifHere again we print Hello, then what will be printed? Now first of all, Hello will be printed, then Good Bye will be printed, then Hello will be printed again. Now what happened here, first we said Hello, we reached here, then we said Good Bye, then we reached here, after that, we printed Hello again, then again our program will reach here, so the program is jumping our control in a way, so we can make the control of the program jump, with the help of our functions, with the help of our sub programs, now after this we ask the next question.The next question of functions says write a function that prints Namaste. If the user is Indian then here we will ask our user whether he is Indian or French. What can we do for Indian? We can enter I. For French in character we can enter F. If our user is Indian then in that case we will print Namaste. If our user is French then in that case we will print Banju. Now if I have not learned French then I am not sorry.How will we pronounce this, we are pronouncing it as buzzer with let s. For the children who have learned French, this is the French Namaste. So now we create a function for both of them. There will be a function which prints Namaste. There will be a function which prints Namaste. Let s create a function for both. Let s remove our old code from here. So first of all we will declare both our functions as void print or just write Namaste andOne is Void Banj, now first of all we will write its definitions Void Namaste, what does it do, it prints Namaste, after that the second function is Void Narur and it will print our French Namaste, so this is the first function, we have this is our second function, now what will we do inside the main, first of all we ask the user for his nationality, print F, enter F for French and I for Indian, now as soon as he enters anything, we enter a character. We will be scanning the percentage C C from the scanner. If our nationality and the character entered are equal then in that case we will print Hello Else. We will be printing Narur. So once we recap the code, above we have made a prototype of the function. First of all, what we did was ask for the nationality and store it in the character set. After that, we compared the character with I and if there is a match.Then call Namaste function. If there is no match and we go inside the if condition then we will call Ban Jure. Below we have given the definition of both the functions, what is the meaning of both the functions, let s save and run it. Now what will we do? Enter F for French and I for Indian. If we are Indian then we will enter I, then Namaste is printed for us. Run this code again and enter F, this time it is printed as Ban Root.In this way, according to the conditions given by the user, we can write different functions and execute different codes. The next thing we will talk about is some properties of the function. The first property in the function is named that execution always starts from main. It means whenever we are talking about C program, in fact whether we talk about C or Java program, our code.Execution happens, it always starts from the main function. No matter how many lines you write in the program, like we have written something above in the program or we shift our function definition above, it is not that the Namaste function will come up, then first take the Namaste function. It must be getting called. No, the compiler always first goes to the main function for execution and the main function tells what is going to happen now.If we remove these two statements from here, that is, never call Namaste and Banju, then our compiler will never call this Namaste and this second greeting will never be printed on the screen, that is why whenever the execution of the program starts, it starts from the main function. The second thing, a function gets called directly and indirectly from main. Whenever a function is called inside C, that means the function is called.To get the work done, either the main function calls it directly like we did in our case. What is happening in this case is that our functions are being called from within the main function or the other function is calling some other function like what do we do here, we call Namaste, whatever the nationality, we will greet him in both the greetings. We have called Namaste and Namaste, what are you doing, Namaste?After printing, what happened is that the main function called this function of ours and the Namaste function called our second function, so this second function is indirectly called from the main function because the main function had called Namaste, so in this way, if any function is called inside c, then either the main function calls it directly or the main function calls it.Indirectly calls through some other function. Now if we analyze it once, then save it and compile it once and run it. Now, no matter what nationality I enter, for me first of all Namaste was called because what happened was that the main function first called Namaste, what did Namaste do? It printed Namaste, after that it called the second function, after that the second function closed it.If it is printed then first of all Namaste will be printed, after that our second greeting will be printed, so in this way, what does the control do? It goes from the main function to the second function, then from the second function to the third function and then comes back inside the main. Now the next property which we will talk about is There can be multiple functions in a program, which we have already seen, we have already made two functions. You can put as many buttons as you want inside your remote, similarly in your C program.You can create as many functions as you want inside it, provided that you create the functions logically. We are not writing extra code to create more functions. Now there are two types of functions, the first type is our library functions and the second is Our user defined functions are library functions which are special functions which are inbuilt in C, meaning there are different libraries inside C in which some functions are already present. The names of those functions are keywords. For us, we cannot create any function of our own again in the name of their functions. Their functions are also already fixed and others are our user defined functions which are declared by us, the programmer and we.If we define it, then the coders are declaring it. The coders are defining it. The coders are using it. If we talk about library functions, then already we are using the library functions. If we print F, then this print F is a library function. How is print F being called? First its name is being written, after that the parentheses are being put. Now some parameters are passed inside it. Now we will talk about what are the parameters.This print F is also a function, this scan F is also a function, so print F and scanf are inside our library or inbuilt functions and C and what is their library. We have put our preprocessor directive std ad a above, that is why we are able to use them. If we remove them, then errors will start coming inside the code, that is why it is necessary to write the statement and our functions print f and scanf are ours.Library functions are user defined functions. We have already seen this which we have created. This is what we have created. Earlier we had written print hello or print goodbye. These are all our user defined functions. Next let s talk about passing arguments. Now what do functions do? In the beginning when we talked about the definition, what was the property of the function that they can take any value and they can give any value, then the value whichThe function takes are called parameters and the value that the function returns is called return value. So the function takes our parameter and gives us back a return value. Whenever we pass an argument, whatever values we give to our function are called arguments. So we can write our functions in three ways. One way is as we have been writing before, that is, void will be written here, void means our function does not return anything.What remains is the name of our function. Then here we have written the parenthesis of our statement terminator. This is a normal type of function which we have already talked about. How can we write the function in another way? First of all it will be written as void i.e. the function does not return any value. For example, suppose we have to create a function whose name is print table. It takes any number and prints its table. Now it does not have to return anything, just print it, so in its parameters i.e. the value that isIt will definitely have a number in it, the number of which it has to print the table, then that number is our int n, so it will take this number n and get its table printed and will not return anything back. The third way of writing the function is that we have a return type, like in the case of even, we have taken int as a return type and what is this function doing? It is taking two parameters, the first parameter is a, the second parameter is b, it will take both the parameters and will create an even value from them which will be a b.And it will return it, now it is returning so what is the type of this value int, that is why we have written int in front of the name of our function, let us create a function which will take the value of two numbers i.e. two numbers, its parameters will be a and b and it will return us the sum of both the values, so for this, first of all, let s remove our old code, enter first number int a and b, then first of all we will scan a, after that we will enter our second number, what is in the second number?We will store the value of the second number in B. Now let s create a function which will give us the sum of both A and B. So first of all, this time we will be writing E sum int a int b. This time we did not write void here, this time we wrote int here like int is written in front of main because it returns zero. We also have to write the type of our return value here, so we have written it this time as int. After that, the name of our function andwrite your parameters inside So, what are our parameters, what are the values required? To calculate the sum, first of all we need integer value a. We need our first number, after that we need integer value b. Now what do we do if we write the definition of the function, then again int sum int a int b. What is the sum value a b? So what will we be returning? We use the keyword return to return any value.After whom does it go to the calling function, here we will call this same function from the main function but suppose we call this same function from some other function, then the return value goes to that other function and does not go to the main, so wherever the call is made, if the return value comes back to the same place, then we will return a b. So let us look at this function carefully. First of all, we told the return type is int, so we returned a b. From here, if weEven if we had returned 1 2 12, no error would have occurred because ultimately it has to return an integer. This would have been logically wrong because a could be zero.Return the value of pi or some other value or suppose we try to return any character, then after that we will be getting error because returning those values is not allowed. If you return even 3.14, then it will return only three, it will not send the complete 3.1, so here we will return a b, that is why we should know our turn type in advance and these integers a and integer b, we need to take edge parameters inside our function.If they are matching then from here we call Sum a and b. Here we create a variable named s, so what is happening here is that we called Sum in which we first passed a and then passed b. What will this a do? We will send its value here. Whatever our user enters inside a, we will send it to a and it will be copied to this a inside the definition here, so the values are copied. If the value of b is passed from here, then the value of b will be sent to this b.This will be copied inside . We could have also written x and y, so here for simplicity, if we write it asLet s save the percentage d once and run the code. There is a little complexity, so there is no need to take any tension. We will see a lot of examples and a lot of explanations and many properties that the concept of the function will seem very simple and will settle in the mind very well. First of all, let s enter our first number. Now we have to understand it logically. Now do not pay attention to what is written in the code, we just have to understand the logic. We should not look at this code like a small calculator of the user.We can first put the first number in the calculator, let s say F. After that, put the second number in the calculator. We put three. Now what is printed, it is printed for us, Sum is A. This is printed here, we do a little good formatting once more and run it. First of all, we put four in our first number, that is, in the calculator, we put four, after that we put our second number, two, so the sum is six. It is printed for us, so our calculator has done the job now.Let us understand how the calculator is working internally. There is a function inside the calculator whose name is sum. In it, it has taken integer a and integer b, so we have taken our a and b and called it sum. The definition of sum says that the value of a will be sent first of all, its value will be copied inWe got the value printed, so this is our entire function which works with parameters and return value. Now as we have written the code to print the sum, apart from this, take one more code. Let s see what that will do. Let s create a function which will print out a table of our number n. So, let s make a few changes inside this code. We will be entering a number. We entered n, scanned it and stored it inside our variable n. Now let s create another function whose name is void print table and inside this function we will send a variable int n. Now it is not necessary that we name it n here, we will call it x.You can name any number, that is, in which variable do you store that value inside the main function and what name do you want to give to the same value inside the second function, they can be the same or can be different, if you keep the same then it will be easy to keep track of which value is going where, if there are names of the beans, then we will know that if we want to get even, then only a and b have to come out, x and y do not come out in this way, but weNow whenever we declare a variable inside a function, the scope of the name of that variable is only till that function, that is, if we create a variable n in the main function, then the only function that will recognize this n will be the main one. Now if I create another number n inside the sum, then it will be a separate variable n, so in this way two variables will be created inside the memory, one with the name n will be of our main function.If one is of our second function, then we can also give the same name. We can also give different names by convention. We will give the same name. There is a print table inside which there is a single parameter whose name is int n. Now let s define our print table function. The return type is void. After this we will write the name of our function print table and int n. How to print a table of any number. By putting a loop, first of all make a loop inside this function. The value of i will be starting with one.And the value of i will go up to 10 and every time we will do i pps, every time we will be printing i in n, so this is our print table function, inside which we have written our entire loop to print the table, then we are writing the loop inside the function, now what will we do with this function, we will call it from the main function, print table and will pass our variable n in it. Whenever we call any function and we are passing our variable in whatever is there, then hereThe variable we are passing is called argument and the variable that comes here is called parameter, that is, the variable which we write in the calling statement is called argument or it is also called actual parameter. Argument or actual parameter. Why actual parameter because it is the n in which the actual value will be. This is the n which will tell which table of numbers is to be printed. This is its function.The n inside is empty so it does not have any value yet. Where will the value come from? It will come from the calling function. The calling statement will come from the calling statement. This statement here will be telling which number of table is to be printed and the variable which is written here, we call it parameter or it is also called formal parameter. It is formal i.e. it is for telling, the actual value will come from the calling one, it will give an argument.Here we have only formally told that there will be an integer value n. Here we do not need to tell that there will be an integer. Can we directly call from here without telling the data type? These are very important keywords which we need to pay attention to, we call it argument, we call it parameter, now save this code and run it once by opening a new terminal window, then in print F, we tell the type, percentage, D, save and run our number.If we enter then we have to print the table of fives, so it has been printed for us. 5 10 15 should have been printed in the next next line. Let s compile it once again and print the table of fives. So this time the table of fives has been printed. 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 In this way, let s take a look at the code. Have we done a little recap? We have done ourCreated a function which was declared with the name print table, took the number from the user and then called it. The value we passed to our print table number n is called argument or our parameter. After that, what did the print table do with number n? Took this number n, we will call it parameter or our formal parameter, then he got his table printed according to that number. In this way, what does our function do? It takes a value and returns the value. In this case it did not return anything. In this case it returned an integer value. Now let us learn some differences. We will learn the differences. This is a very important question between argument and parameter. What will many interviewers say and ask you?What are the differences between argument and parameter or is this such a classical question. When I studied C in my first semester, this question came again and again in my mid semester and end semester that write the differences between the two. I still remember that question of number three and there was one number for each point, so you can write different points also. Apart from this, there are some other points too but the major ones are the points.Those differences are being covered in this. What are the arguments? What are the values that are passed in the function call? The value we passed inside the function call is called argument. What are the values in function declaration and definition? The value which is written in the declaration and in the definition, we call it parameter. Like inside our code here we have written int a or int n, this is also our parameter and this is also a parameter.And where the call is made where the data type is not written, that is our argument. Now the work of argument is to send value. The work of parameter is to receive value. Argument is also called actual parameter and parameter is also called formal parameter. These are some differences which you can remember a little bit. It is very important to remember because whenever we learn a language, we have to remember some things because whenever we learn something new.The code will appear in front of you. Syntax which are the concepts of basic programming, we have to remember them. Later on, when there are big problems, we can solve them with logic, like in A B C D, we have to remember how we used to write A B C D. We used to practice writing again and again. Similarly, right now we are learning the A B C D of our C. We have to remember this A B C D. Now there are some notes regarding the functions, first of all.Function can only return one value at a time. In a function like parameters, you can write 100. Here inside the sum, we have also takenReflect the values in calling function. Let s first look at it with an example because if we look at this statement, we will see the complexity. What do we do? First of all, let s create a function and name it Print Price. What does this function do? You can also name it just Calculate Price. It will take the price of any item, add GST on it at 18 and then get that value printed. So, let s keep the return type of this function as void, we give it a name.Calculate price and there will be some value coming inside it, int value. Now let s write the definition of this function void calculate price, there will be some value coming inside it, int value. Now what will it do to the value itself, value plus in fact, let s make this integer value a float. Why float because there will be a decimal value on 18, most probably, so it will be easy for us, it will make the value value plus 0.18.Multiply by Value What it did is add GST on 18 here inside this value and now it will print this same value Final Price Percentage A Value So here we take our value as any in the beginning, we have assigned it 100, now we will call the calculate price according to 100 in which we will pass our value, let s save it and let s run it once.What happened as soon as we did it, it told us our price was 1, it applied GST in it, it became 11118 and it finally printed it and gave it to us, it is very clear if we have understood the functions very well, we have seen the questions questions properly. Try to do the same a little bit yourself by pausing the video from time to time, so far we should not have any issue in the code, there should not be any problem, it should be understood very easily because the most basic things have been done, we have declared our function, we have defined the function and called the function. Now let us do a different thing, here we get the value printed, first we called the function, now we print the value.If we get it done then the value is percentage f value. Now let s save it. What should happen according to our logic? First of all we have written the value as 100. Then the calculate price was called. What did the calculate price do? It changed the value to 100. On 18th GST, the price became 118. So it got the value printed here. 118 will now come back inside the main function. Now again the value will be added.So now 118 will be printed in our console and then after returning our function will end. This is what our logic is telling us. Now if we save and run this function then this time it is printed first of all the final price is 118 but the value is 100. Why is it printed like this? Here inside the calculate price our value is 118 but inside the main function as soon as we are going back the value becomes 100 again.This is happening because whatever change we do inside our other functions like calculate price, whatever change we make in our parameters will not be reflected in the argument, that is, even if you make this value zero in calculate price, it will not be able to change the argument with this value, so this is a property that no matter how many changes you make in the same variable inside the functions.But there will be no change in the value of the original argument which was there at the time of calling, so if there is any wrong code written in your function due to which suppose there are some issues and there the value of your variable becomes zero, becomes negative or goes wrong, then your main function will not be affected because all the code inside it is correct and the values will be correct, then from here comes this property that changes to parameters in the function.The changes that occur in the parameters do not change the values. Inside the calling function, they do not change the value of the argument and why this happens. The reason behind this happening is because a copy of the argument is passed to the function. Whenever the main function calculates its price from Calculate Price, it sends the value to it, but this value is not a copy, it is the original value.The variable does not come here. The value of this argument is copied inside the value variable near Calculate Price. The data that was inside the value 100.0, all the value of the argument is copied inside the parameter. This is the reason that if you keep changing anything in that copy, it will not give you the change back in the original. Next let s solve a question. The question uses our library function.To use library functions to calculate the square of a number given by the user, now we know what is the square of a number, the square of a number is the number multiplied by the number, we have to use the library function here, there is a library, Method A, inside which are all the functions of math. There is a function inside this library, whose name is Power, we have already discussed a little about it, now the name of the power function is PO, inside whichFirst of all, we enter our number i.e. whatever number we want to take the power of, after that we enter the power, then we enter two, what will it return, will it return the number to the power 2. Here, if we enter pow n4, what will it return to us, power of n is 4, because we have to take a square, then we will be entering the number and two, so let s use it. Once above, first of all, we will include our library. If we do not include it, then we will not be able to use the function, hence above.We will have to include this method A. After that, what will we do? Let s comment it out in our main function. Take a number int n. We keep the value of int n as four. Now we print the percentage d. Here we will write power. First we will put the number n and then two. So if you look at this statement carefully, what have we done? R function is called, then the first parameter in the parens is its number n and the second parameter is whatever power you have to put above the number i.e. two, then this function will calculate n to the power 2 and give it back, which will be printed by our F, that is, our second library function will print it on the top of the screen. Now save this code once and run it. Here we have a warning generated. The warning says int but the argument type is double i.e. this number.What does this power function of ours do? It will give us a double value by returning it. If we look at it, we have the declaration statement of the power function. We have double, its return type is power, its name is and it takes two values, double and double. Now here is the automatic integer, we have passed integer n and integer 2. Both these values can be automatically converted into implicit double because double is a big data type, it can be put in a container from small to big.If there is a problem in putting from small to big container, then the compiler can automatically put it from small to big, then it will convert it, but it will not convert its double into integer, that is why we write f here, to print the floating value, the percentage f we have is for the double only, but the floating values are also printed with the percentage f, that is why whenever the double has to be printed, whenever the double has to be scanned.So we will use percentage F. Float automatically comes to us as input. Now the next question which we will be talking about is the name of the right functions to calculate the area of a square, a circle and a rectangle. So we have to create three functions. One function will calculate the area of a square, one will calculate the area of a circle and one will calculate the area of a rectangle. First of all, we will declare all three functions in our program at the top.Let s talk about area of square. What will area of square do? Assume that only side will come as integer and if square will come then integer will be its return type or let s make it float. Float will be its return type and its name is square area. We will be passing inside it we will write the definition of side of the square. Float is not integer but side, it should be a floating value. Square area will come in. We have the parameter float side is the area of a square. Side multiplied by side, so from here we will directly return side.Multiply by side Now we will write the area of a circle, so first of all float circle area will come in, we will have the floating value its radius, then we will also write its definition, float circle area will come in, float radius will return what is the area of the circle, we will have p r s so 3.1 4 multiply by radius in radius, now let s create another function which will calculate the area of the rectangle, float rectangle area, two values will come in it, float side A and float will also return this.The type is done, we gave it the name float, rectangle area, two values will come inside it, first of all we have side A and then side B. What is the area of the rectangle?Float b 10.0 Now let s print the value of our area. Area is percentage f. Here we will call rectangle area in which we will pass the first value a and then the second value is our b. Let s save this code. We have declared all the three functions. We have defined all the three functions. Inside the main function, we will calculate the area of the rectangle by testing A and B. We open the terminal, compile and run it.The output we have is 5 10 50. In this way, you can create many functions inside the code and according to your taste, we can get the same work done by calling whatever function we need. Next topic about which we are going to talk in C, its name is Rikars. Now Rikars, students who are learning programming for the first time may find it a magical topic. If you start seeing magic, then there is no need to worry at all, you are learning programming.Recurrence means that whenever a function calls itself When a function calls another function, a function calls another function, a Namaste function calls a banju function, or another function calls another function, this happens normally in programming, but when a function calls itself and then calls itself again, this process is called recursion.The function keeps calling itself again and again. Like, first of all let s see it with the help of an example. We have to ask a question whose name is Print Hello World five times. We have to print Hello World five times but we have to print it five times. Now we could have done it with the help of item statement i.e. we could have done it with the help of loops but here we will use recurs. Well, a small thing which can seem quite interesting. If any work in programming is done with loops.If it is possible then that work can also be done by recursion and the work which can be done by recursion can also be done by loop but the difference is that the work which sometimes requires us to write a lot of lines to do it through loop can be done in two three lines by recursion and the work which sometimes requires writing a lot of lines to do it by recursion can be done in a few lines by loop so we have to see where items i.e. loops will be used and where else.Recount will be used, so first of all, to see the example of recursion, we print Hello World five times. There is a function which gives us print Hello World. Its name is void print hello world and inside this we pass a parameter which will tell how many times we print it. We can also call it count. Int count. Let s write the definition of this function void print hello world and here the count will be coming that how many times we have to print it but there is no loop inside it.What will it do inside the function, it will print the word Hello only once? What is this function, it is a little lazy, it will do a little work itself and will get the rest done by itself in the next call, so what will it do now, it will print Hello World, it will not print the count times on Hello World, it will not print the count times, it will call itself to print the count times, then print Hello World, now it has printed it once, Hello World has been printed, now the count times had to be printed n times here.It can happen five times here, it can happen even 10 times. Now once it is printed, then the count is left to get the number of times printed and if ever these counts would have been 1 1 1, the value of this count would have been if it becomes zero after that, then there is no need to print anything, otherwise we will just write return here, we will notice here only return is written, return is going from zero to zero after return, if nothing is written then there is no return, hence return type.So this is our example of recursion, we also call it cursive function. If you are not able to understand it at all, then there is no problem at all. Just to confuse it, recursion is being told in this way first so that it can apply a little bit of magic. What will we do here, we will call print hello world and the count will pass five because we have to print it five times. We save this code and run it in the terminal, so hello world will come to us.Hello World Hello World is printed five times. Once we format it, Hello World is printed five times in the next line. Now if we had written 10 here, if we had written 10 and saved it, Hello World would have been printed 10 times. Now what did this function do? Print Hello World is a function, it is calling itself within itself, that is, it is calling Print Hello World and because of this call, again and again, aThe function is printing Hello World only once, so this function calls itself five times and prints Hello World again and again, so this is a recurse function and we have just seen the example of Recurse. Let us understand Recurse with the help of a little math. Now those children who did not like Math in school, they may find it a little boring but we will not teach boring Math. Here we will have a very small discussion as if we used to have functions inside Math.If fx1 had to be calculated then it would be the square of va i.e. 1. If f2 had to be calculated then it would be 2. If we had to find the square of f3 i.e. 4, it would be the square of 3 i.e. 9. Similarly, there were some teachers who would ask us for trouble, how would we do it? First, fxxx.pro found out its value and gave it to us, so we can call it our recurse function. We saw recursion happening in math. First of all, the outsider f found the inside value, got the call made inside, then the insider did some work, gave that work to the outsider, then the outsider.The person did some work and he gave it to us, so there were levels, here the method of calling can be similar, what can a teacher tell us to find out f off f off f off x like f off f off f offOne which again it applied itself, then first of all the inner call will work. What will the inner call do? It will give us 4 forExample Similarly, what is a normal function call, that is, when one function calls another function, what happens in it? We have a main function. What does the main function do? It calls a normal function f. This normal function does some work for us and returns a value to the main function. It is possible that this normal function is calling some other function and that is doing some work.Return f and give one to one and f returns one to the main function which has control of its own. In this way our normal function is called but whenever we talk about recursion, there is something special inside the recursion. Our main function inside the recursion, if a function is giving to the function fxxx.pro, then every time the call is being made to itself, then the functions which call themselves again and again are called recursive functions.And we call this process recursion. Now there is a very logical way of doing recursion and we will understand this logical method with the help of the question. Our question is the sum of first and natural numbers. We have to find it. Now let us analyze it a little that what can be the sum of the first and natural numbers. The sum ranges from 1 2 3 4 to n 1 n like 5. If we have to find the value for n 5 then it isIt would be 1 2 3 4 5 If for n 4 the solution would be 1 2 3 4 For n 3 the solution would be 1 2 3 For n 2 it would be 1 2 For n 1 it would be 1 Now n 0 cannot be because row is a whole number and is not a natural number. Here we will observe a pattern. The pattern is that in n allThis value is common in natural numbers. After this, this value is common. After this, this value is common. Then this value is common. If it remains in this way, then what can we write about the sum of natural numbers? What can we write about n 2? We can write this as Sum of n 1 2, meaning you calculate the sum till n 1, just add two to it, then what we will have is Sum of n Natural Numbers.Will it come or write this more press easily, then find out the sum till the sum of one, add two to it, what is here, find the sum till two, add three to it, what does it mean, find out the sum till three, and add four to it, this is our sum till three, and to this we have added four, what does it mean, find the sum till four, and add five to it, then this is our sum till four, and we have added to that.Given five, what does it mean, find the sum up to n 1 and add n to it, then all these numbers are giving us the sum up to n 1 and in that we have added our n in the same way, here we have the sum till two, to which we have added three, here we have added up to one, to which we have added two, so in a way we are able to see that we have to find the sum of n, so what is it telling us that before finding the sum of n, n Take the sum of 1 and add n to it, then the sum function is the same, meaning the work we are trying to do here and the work we are trying to do here. What we are trying to do is the same thing, there is just a slight difference in it, we just have to add a value, so what does this function do? It is calling itself, calling itself, we are able to see that first it is calling for n, then it is calling for n 1, then it is calling for n 2, then it will be calling for n 3 until we reach here n 1, this is our last.Now Rickson too will call himself somewhere but he can call himself up to a limit, not how many times he has to call himself. If you want to find the sum of n numbers then you have to call n times and who will track these calls? These calls will be tracked by our parameters because in the parameters, just as we had reduced the count to zero by decreasing the value of count, similarly here we have decreased the value of n by first five, then four, then three again.Two then one will take us to one, there is no other value after one because there are more natural numbers otherwise this will be our last value here, our calculation will end here and we call this condition as base case. Now we write this entire code once and see it and understand all the things. First of all, what will we do, we will declare our function above. The name of the function is even. Inside this we will pass our n, so the value of our n can be anything. First of all, ourNow let s write the recursion function. This function is not of void type. It will return an integer value and what integer value will this integer value be? Our sum is int sum int. We have to find the sum from a through a to a. So what was the sum function saying? If we have to find the sum from n to n, then first find the sum from n to n minus and add A to it. So what will we do? Find the sum from n to n minus.If we take this, we will write it here as two a minus. This is a bit complex name, so here we will create a variable integer, sum of n minus 1. What we want to say is that this value indicates the sum of two a and we will store it inside this variable and where will it come from and will come from this sum function because if this sum function can find the sum of a values then it can definitely find n minus because now we will write the logic from here we will take n.Trust is a very big factor in the sum of recension. We have to have faith that our recurs function will do the work for us, so here we have to have faith that the sum of n 1 values will bring us the sum of recension, which can be a little tricky topic, but the more we solve its questions, the more we will understand what is meant by recjan, what is the logic of calling itself, then sum is the solution.Sum of n 1 What will we do after that, which will be our total sum, the sum till a will be the sum of n 1 n right and this function will return the pass and give us the sum of n. So once again let us understand a little bit about the work of this function is that it will give us the sum of all the natural numbers from one to n. So, first of all what we do is take the sum of the natural numbers till n 1, so we took that and stored it in this variable and then the sum of n.What is the sum up to n 1 plus n in that, then we stored both of them in the sum of n and returned the sum of n. Now what will be the base condition here? Every time the value of our n will go to 1, then the base condition will be if the value of a becomes one. In that case, we know what is the sum of one, otherwise y will directly return the answer f is one. Let us save it and call it in our main function.Let s print a sum is percentage. First of all we have to calculate and print the sum of 1 to 5. Let s save and run. So till five, the sum of 1 2 3 4 5 has come to us. We have got 15 and how could it have come. Let s analyze it once. So what did we do first of all? We called the sum of five. I thought that first of all I should calculate the sum of four.What will I do in it, I will add five to it. Sum of four thought, first of all, I find out the sum from one to three, I will add four to it. Then, Sum of three thought the same thing, I am also becoming smart. I calculate the sum from one to two, I will simply add three to it. Why should I do more work? Sum of two thought, this is too much. My handwriting is very bad, I calculate the sum of one, in it I add two. I will add and the sum of one already knows that its value is one, so if our process is like this, then what actually happened is one. Our base case was that one returned one here, so here it is 1 2, that is, 3, this value is 3, it is returned here, so it is 3 3, that is, 6, this value is 6. It is returned here, 6 4, that is, 10, so these are the 10 values here.Here it is 10 5 i.e. 15, so this value is returned from here and back to our main function, we have the answer 15, so at every level, whatever work we have, we keep giving it to the next level, but somewhere, that work will have to be actually written and we have done the work of actually writing. Here in our base case, what will the base case do, it will stop the recursion, plus we are believing that the next level will give us some work.The next level will give us some work but that actual work will have to be done somewhere, at some level or the other, that work is done on our base case, at our last level, so these n times are our levels which are called, this was the first level, this was the second level, this was the third level, this was the fourth level, this was the fifth level. In the language of programming, this is called Recurse Tree. We need to go into so much detail. No, even the word Recurse Tree is not used in C programming.We need to remember what happens but if we have to understand recovery from a diagram, what have we done? We have understood recovery from boxes, we have understood recovery from code, we have understood recovery from maths and now we have understood recovery from diagram, so all the four directions ways of understanding recovery have been discussed and in the most lovely way, in the best way, I have tried very hard to understand recovery very well.If I can sit in it, we have done that thing very well. Now let s move on to the next question. The next question tells us that we have to do the factorial of n. So just like we had calculated the sum of n, similarly the factorial of n says that now before doing the recognition, we have to use a paper pen a little bit and a little bit of our brain. We have to think logically and find out how it will be repeated. We are doing these very standard questions in C. Ask mostly the same questions.Let us go inside the exam, there is no need to take so much tension, once you practice these questions and there will be one or two homework problems along with them, you will do it, you will not face any problem inside the exam, we have to find the factorial of n, so like what the sum used to say, if the sum used to say that if we want to find the sum of n, then find the sum of n 1, add n in it, something similar happens in our case, if you carefully follow the formula of factorial.Let s see what 5 factorial says. 5 factorial is 1 2 3 4 5. What is 4 factorial? 1 2 3 4. 3 What is FTO? 1 2 3. What is 2 FTO?So 4 fto is written as 3 fto 4. This can be written as 2 fto 3. This can be written as 1 fto 2. And this will always be our one. Obviously, how will we calculate below this? Either we will write 0 factorial which is also row but we cannot multiply it by row, so base case we can put it on 1 factorial where the value of pe will be already defined, so here also we have aRecurve function has become a recurve function. If we have to find out the factorial of n, what will be its value? You tell me the factorial of n 1. What I have to do in that is to multiply my n. This is our recursive function. It is exactly like the sum. If you want to find the sum of n, then what to do. Sum of n 1. Tell me, I will add n to it. Similarly, tell me the factorial of n in the factorial. I will add n 1 to it.If I multiply, my factorial of n will come to me, then we convert this same method into code. At the top, we will write our function factorial in which we have to find the factorial of any number n. Now the definition of the function will be int factorial, inside which we will pass the parameter n. Before calculating the factorial of n, let us calculate the factorial of n 1. We believe that this function will calculate and give the factorial of n 1, then we will write int factorial of.n 1 Factorial n 1 Now int factorial of n will be factorial of n 1 Multiply by n and return the factorial of n and the base case. What will happen here, when will we stop? We will stop when the value of our n becomes one. As soon as the value of n becomes one, we will return one. Or in fact, here we can stop at row also. If there is a return of zero, then in that case we will return one, so let s save it. Now here we will write factorial is five, take out the factorial of the new terminal, compile and run, then five.We have got the factorial of 120 printed. Similarly, we can also get the factorial of 4. The factorial of 4 will get printed as 24. Now let us analyze what we have done here in the factorial. In our factorial function, we had to get the factorial of n. What is the simplest way to get it? Find out the factorial of n 1. Who will get it? The same function will get the same function, only the parameters will change in it, after that the factorial of n 1 will be calculated.Let s multiply it with n and we get factorial n. We will return it finally and here also by making a tree structure we can understand completely how things will work. The same thing is going to happen here as we did earlier. We called factorial Pa. He thought first take out factorial f and multiply it by five. Then he called factorial 3. Multiply it by four. Then he called factorial two and multiply it by 2.Let s call three and then multiply the factorial one by that. Let s call two and multiply the factorial 0 by that. What is the factorial of one? One gives because this is our base case. Now it returned the value here 1 1 2 will give us 2 Here pay two returned it gave 2 3 6 Here pay 6 returned it gave 6 4 24If it returned 24 then it gave 24 5 120 so the final answer we had 120 printed for factorial fv. The next thing we will talk about is some properties of recursion, so recursion has some properties of its own. First of all, anything that can be done with it s iteration can be done with it s iteration and vice versa. All the work that we did with it s iteration through loop is done with it s iteration.And whatever work we do with recurs can be done through it all. Just sometimes recurs helps, sometimes loops help in writing very simple code. Second property is recursion can some times give the most simple solution. Like this, going ahead we will read the data structure of trees. Tree is the data structure of trees, we can read it in C , we can read it in Java, while doing it, we will read the values of the tree.We may not be able to imagine what we are writing right now, but the code of item is very long and the code of complexity is just three lines of code to print all the values, in such cases, Recon helps in writing very simple code. Base case is the condition inside Recon that stops the recon, so the recon is running again and again, it will stop at some place and the condition in which it stops is called that.We have our base case and the fourth property of Recon is that just like we have all the infinities in the item and after that our program will crash. Similarly, if Recon continues to run again and again and there is no base case in it, then we call that condition as stack overflow. The basic meaning of stack overflow is that our memory is filled and now our program will crash, that is why base case is very important whenever we talk about recon.And whenever we are writing a calculation program, we should never forget the base case, like for example, in the factorial case code, if I remove this base case and suppose I am printing it every time, this is what I am calculating, I am calculating the factorial of A, where I have to print the value of A every time, I save it and run it once, here my program has crashed at the end andSegmentation fault is printed. Segmentation fault has happened because I have not written the condition in the recension. Let s run it once again. This is segmentation fault. Program crashes. Why did this happen? If we analyze from above where the call was made, then every time we see that this number which is n was first n then n 1. Then n 2 happened five, fourth happened three happened two happened one happened every time again zero happened every time what we did in the base case was stop at row, this time we removed the condition that stop at zero so this time the values started in negative 1 became 2 became 3 became 4 became 5 and here happened 1 7338 again and in negative and in negative and andIt went negative and negative and became more negative until our program was completely filled and the program crashed. That s why you should never miss the base case at the time of recursion because a lot of issues will be raised then your program will crash. Now let s ask some questions about functions and recurs. The first question which we are going to do is write a function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. We saw that.Used to study Physics in 11th and 12th, so what was the first basic thing in it? The first basic thing was taught in Thermodynamics or I don t know in which chapter. Convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit. If you convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius then there is no need to memorize its formula. It is not important which formula will be used. You can also ask the teacher for the formula. You might have usually given it in exams or coding.If this question has been given in the test, then the formula would have been given in it. The formula is that multiply 9 5 by whatever value of Celsius and add 32 to it, like 0, if we take 0 Celsius, what is the multiply by 0.18 32, then 0 degree Celsius is our 32 degree burst, so this method of calculation remains with us. We will be using this formula, which creates a function which will calculate the Celsius value.Will take and convert it into Fahrenheit, then we write this function. First of all, we will declare the function. Our function will return a floating value to us. The name of this function is Convert Temperature. In Convert Temperature, we have taken a floating value from it which is Celsius. Now let us define it as Float Convert Temperature and inside it we have got the value Float Celsius which will convert us from Celsius to Fahrenheit.If we want to convert then what will be int Fahrenheit? Our value of Celsius will be multiplied by 9 5 plus 32. So if we see the prefix, first of all it will be multiplied, after that our value will be being added and it will not be integer but we will write it as float and will be returned. Our value of Fahrenheit will be returned. What will we do inside the main function? We will call inside the main function and pass the convert temperature in it. Let s assume that we have passed row degrees.And from here our Fahrenheit value will be returned to us. Now we will get our Fahrenheit temperature printed as a percentage. Let s save it. We have created a convert temperature function in which we get the temperature value in Celsius and return it. We return the Fahrenheit value and run it. So we have 32 degrees Fahrenheit. We have got it printed. Similarly, if we assume that we have any value in Celsius.We are sending the temperature like we are sending 32 Celsius then it will be converted into Fahrenheit 64 degree. Here we made a small mistake that we have written integer values here as 9 5 so this is also an integer. This is also an integer 9 5. If we divide then it will give one but as per rule it should be multiplied with 1.8 so here we make it 99.0.Now let s make it 5.0. Now these are floating values. Now let s run our code. Now we had passed 32 degrees so for us it came to 89.5 1999 degrees. If we pass the normal body temperature which is 37 degrees Celsius then at 37 degrees Celsius you do not have fever. So your body temperature means 98.5 degrees. So whenever we talk about whether you have fever then it is 98 degrees 99 degrees.The fever has become 100 degrees. The fever has become 103. It is actually in Fahrenheit. We have these temperatures in Celsius, so we have written a conversion function. In this way, we have the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion function. We can create it ourselves and there can be other different functions. You can convert all the formulas of physics within one function. That is done in the code.When a game is developed and codes are written using C , then how fast will our main character run, what will be his acceleration? What will be the direction of the bullet that is being fired? What will be its coordinates? What will be the coordinates in the aqua plane? What will be the coordinates in 2D plane or 3D plane? All these formulas are written in the form of functions. In the code, functions are very important. In fact, physics is very important. If you want to go into game development, then the next question which is given to us.That is the right function to calculate the percentage of a student. There is a student for whom we have been given marks of three subjects. We have given marks of Science.Calculate Percentage Calculate Percentage takes the marks of three subjects, first of all it will take the marks of Science, then of Math and then of Sanskrit and after calculating the percentage in Int Ger, we will get it back. Now let s define this function Calculate Percentage, inside which we will pass our Science marks. Int Ger Science Int Math and Int Sanskrit. How to calculate the percentage? Let s add all the three marks.Let s divide by 3, multiply by 100, then we will return Science marks plus Math marks plus Sanskrit marks. Divided by 3 and we will multiply this entire value by 100, so in this way we will get the percentage. Now let s make Science marks here. Suppose in Science we have got 98 out of 100, in Math we have got even 95 and in Sanskrit I have got my percentage.I would like to write 99 marks here which came after my lot of hard work in 8th class in Sanskrit. Now finally let s print our percentage percentage e percentage d and call our calculate percentage function in which we will pass the marks of science, marks of maths and marks of Sanskrit and save it. We created a calculate percentage function in which we took the marks of all the three subjects and returned the percentage in this function.Here we have defined the marks of all the three subjects, we declared them inside the main function and we called our function, now after opening a new terminal window, first compile and run, the percentage is 970. Actually, we did not have to multiply it by 100 because if we are already calculating the marks from 100, then the percentage will be 97. So if you want to calculate the marks in this way, thenAlso of your college, you can make a function, you can calculate your percentage by adding all the marks you are getting in it. Next question which we will be solving is write a function to print some terms of the FINA sequence. This FINA is Italian word, it is not called FINA, it is called FINA. Now FINA sequence is a very famous sequence of maths, which is found in many places in our nature as well.Once you search for it, you can find the Fina sequence. This is a very famous sequence. In this way, if you arrange some tiles in the form of a square, you will see the Fina sequence or something like this. If you have seen a spiral somewhere, then it is also known as Fina Spiral. If you go to learn any programming language, you will get the Fina sequence there. What is the sequence of natural numbers?Natu 3 4 5 6 What is the sequence of whole numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 What is the sequence of our odd numbers 1 3 5 7 Even numbers 2 4 6 8 10 Similarly, there is a sequence in nature which is called Fina sequence, this sequence looks something like this 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 Now whenSeeing this for the first time, it seems that random numbers are written, that is, they have written whatever number they want on the screen, but it is not actually so. It was made by Indian mathematicians and the sequence was made with a lot of thought. In the sequence, first comes row, then comes one, then comes one, then two, then 3 5 8 13 21 and so on. After looking at this sequence a little carefully, it becomes clear that each number has its own number.This number is the sum of the last two numbers, like the first number is always zero, the second number is always one, the third number is the sum of row and two i.e. 0 1 1, the fourth number is the sum of one and one, this three is the sum of one and 2. This is five is the sum of two and three, this is 8 and the sum of five is 13, the sum of 5 and a is 21, the sum of 8 and 13 and the whole sequence continues in this manner, so here every number is the sum of its previous two numbers, so in a way we can say that fina, if we have to find out, assume any number, we have to find fina of two, this is fina of zero, this is fina of one.This is Fina of two This is Fina of three This is Fbo of four And so on So to find Fbo of two we can say Fina of plus Fbo of and Fina of three If we have to find it, then we can call it It is Fbo of w plus Fbo of two Fbo of fur If we have to find it, then we can also call it Fina of 2 PS Fina of 3 So from this we get the common function if any numberIf we want to find the fina of n then it is one number two numbers before it plus the number two before that i.e. fina of n 1 phonechi of n 2. In a way we have derived the recursion formula to write our recursion function that fina, make a function which calculates fina for n. Now we do not know the one of n but maybe he knows the one of n 1 and n 2. We are so confident that it will find out both of them.So call both of them. After calling both of them, add both of them and store them in fina of n. So in this way, we write the code for our different finaza numbers. By writing the code, we will understand better. The return type of this function is Int. At every level, it will extract its fina of nth number and return it to the upper levels. Let us name it fi and it will extract the fina sequence for int n. Now.Let s define this function int fina of number a then what is the rule of fina so this is Banachi s rule Fina of the last two numbers take out what numbers were in the sequence and add both of them then int fina of n e to fina of n myve plus fina of n 2 Now let s do this fina of n 1 and n 2 first then call int fina of n myve e fi for n myve thenThis function is calling itself i.e. recalculation is taking place. Here we had to calculate for n, so first we made a call for n might and stored it in this variable. Now we will make another call to get fina of n 2 as fia of n 2. So now we called for n might and stored it in this variable and finally by adding both of them we got fina of n. Now we print this fina of n and will write fina of n here.First percentage D is again percentage D. First of all we will write the value of n i.e. n, after that we will write the value of our fina of n and we will return the value of our fina of n. With this function, this is our recurse function and every recurse function is incomplete without the base case i.e. it is wrong. Now what will be the base case in this? We have FOB of row and fina of one defined, so if the value of n ever becomes zero.Or if the value of n becomes one in some case, then there we will know what will happen for n 0. If n 0, in that case then we have to return zero and if the value of our n is one then in that case we have to return no. Now this is our complete code, the recursive code to calculate FINA, this will be our base condition. What do we do in the base case? We write both of them like different conditions instead of off.Writing one condition if n becomes zero, anywhere n becomes zero i.e. fina of zero we have to return then it is row only. If anywhere we have to return for n 1 then fubo of one is always one. Now here for fina of one we will not calculate fubo of 1 and fina of 1 because for 1 the sequence does not exist. This is our base case i.e. the condition which we should know in advance in fina.We know that the zero term is zero, the first term is one, we already know this, we have calculated it, now what will we do inside the main function, we will get it printed, here we call our fina off, suppose we want to print six terms, we save it and run it, so we have a lot of terms printed instead of six terms of fina, this is why this happened, the reason for this, we understand a little from the diagram why this happened.So many terms were printed because when we try to calculate, say, Fina of five, it calculates first Fina of four and then Fina. What does off three and fina of four do? First calculates fina of three, then fina of two. Finna of three first calculates fina of two and then fina of one. So here this two and this two have been calculated twice, so they have been printed twice. If we talk about three also, then three will be printed once here. Three will be printed here, that is why fina will be printed as many times as the call is being made, so two second term is our one, third.Our term is two. Second term is called again. One, so this is a little complex. Let s run it once again and solve it. So the final of six is eight. Once again we have created the sequence and write the sequence. The sequence is like this 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 This is the required term. This is the first, this is the second, this is the third, this is the fourth, this is the fifth, this is the sixth term.That s right, we only have eight in our FINA sequence, so this is our code to write our sequence and we have written this code in a very simple way. There should be no problem at all. We have understood a complex FINA very well. Now remember this because a lot of FINA questions are asked before you. We have already solved the next question which was how to write a function to print the eighth term of the FINA sequence. We have asked that question now.End terms have to be done in the same way as we have done with recurs, we can do the same thing with loop also, so it will be easier to do it with loop but I would like to give it as a homework problem because I want you to try this question yourself that how can we do this question with loop, how can we write this series, so we have asked a lot of questions, we have read a lot of concepts, here I would request a little light.You have to take a break, you have to drink some water, you have to refresh yourself a bit and after that you have to do your homework problems, you have to sit and revise your notes a little, so now we are going to start our chapter six, which is named Points, now points are a very important topic whenever we talk about C or C , because the core of programming has taught us how the things are actually going on in the memory.At the same time, the topic is a bit complex in the points, some people find it very interesting, some people find it a bit difficult, but in this video we are trying our best, that is, I am trying my best to explain the points very well, after which all the questions should be easily solved. We will be covering all the basic concepts. We will take some questions which form the core of programming, so we will solve the questions well and along with that, we will also give some practice.We will also ask questions like whether the topic of points will get stuck in the mind, let us start with points. Points means a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Usually what happened was that we used to create any one variable inside the memory. Suppose we created a variable int A 22. This variable is storing a value and what is that value? That value is a number and this one.It can be any number, it is a data value, that is, someone is storing data, but if someday it comes to our mind, how all this work is happening inside the memory, we had already talked about that there are blocks inside the memory, inside the blocks some data is stored, wherever that data is stored, we give some name to that place, which name we call a variable. Now whatever is that block of memory, it must have some address inside the memory, like this memory.The address is 2010. The address of this memory is 2013. Here we are talking about the addresses of these blocks. How can we understand this? Suppose we have the complete meaning of the whole. That meaning is our memory. On top of that, there are different plots which are owned by different people. Now it makes us visualize each block. This is a plot on which we have built a house. We have named the house as Edge and the number living inside the house is22 and here is the address of that house 20110 Now in this house yesterday we could remove 22 and keep 21 or by removing 22 we can keep 20, anyone can live in the house i.e. any data can be stored inside any memory location and its name can also be changed. Now, the name of Shahrukh Khan s house is Mannat, the name of Ambani s house is something else, so here we can remove the edge and keep the name of any variable, but the plot above the Earth, which is the land, if there is a farm somewhere, then it will remain there, that land will remain there, that is why this memory block will remain there and its address is always fixed. When our mother comes to the computer, it is already fixed on it.Now the address is going to be, it is not necessary that it be 20110 or 2000, it can be anything, it is possible that addresses are written in a different way in your machine and addresses are written in a different way in my machine. It completely depends on which machine you are using, whether it is 32 bit or 64 bit, what kind of system is yours or what kind of system is mine, so don t worry about the address.Anything can happen, so it is not a fixed number. Whenever you are asked in the question paper, in any college test, there can be any address in it. If the interviewer is asking you, then he will also have to tell you what the address is because there is no fixed format, but I hope that here we have been clear that whenever a variable is created, a data value is stored inside it. The name of that variable is the memory location.And there is an address of the memory location, but today we felt that we should not store the data value i.e. these 22 in a variable, we have to store one memory location, one memory address, so in whatever variable we store that memory address, we name that variable as pointer, like if we have to store the memory address of this edge variable somewhere, then for that we will create a new variable, let s say this.We have given the name of the variable PTR which is short for pointer, now inside it will be stored the memory address i.e. 2010 which is the memory address of Edge but it will also have its own memory address because this location will also exist somewhere, this is also a variable, it is just a variable which is storing the memory address of another variable, so I hope that we have understood the basic thing, now the variable.That stores the memory address of another variable is a pointer. Now there is a syntax to write points. We cannot write points like a normal variable because we have to tell the compiler in advance that the variable we are writing does not store a normal value. It stores the value of a memory address. Which is a special value, so the syntax to write it is normal.We write the variable int as equal to 22. Whenever we create a pointer, we put an asterisk along with int, we put a star, then we write the name of our pointer variable, then we write is equal to end s symbol and edge, that is, this pointer is a variable which is storing the address of this edge. Here we learned two new things, one is this star, this is the star which is this.We call it value at address operator, value at address operator and this M percentage is what we call address of operator. Whoever we put this end in front of, we get its address. Whoever we put a star in front of, we get its value. What does it mean? Here we made a pointer a variable, created a pointer variable, how did we know that the pointer is a variable because the risk seems to be that of a pointer variable.In the syntax and what did we do to it, the address of the edge i.e. whatever address of the edge was now got stored inside this pointer i.e. this location came inside the memory where the pointer variable came and inside it got stored the address of the edge that is 2010 and now if we want to see what value is stored at the address where the pointer is stored, then for that we can use this operator i.e. here weWe are creating a new variable, Underscore Edge, inside which we are storing the value address PTR, that is, take out the value of whatever address is inside the pointer and store it in that new variable. What will happen? First of all, this new variable will be created. The name of the new variable will be Under Edge. It can have some other address. Suppose this is 2011. Now inside it, the value of whatever address is stored on the pointer.Value at Address Which is Stored at Pointer Address Stored in Pointer If the value is 210 then we will go to 210 and see what value is there, then the value stored near the pointer is 210 and what value is stored at 20110, then we will go to 210, the value is stored there, our 22, so we will pick up that 22 value and put it in the new underscore range. Let s do a little recap once.Original variable created int A 22 How do we declare our pointer? We write int star. If we write int star, we will get a pointer to store the value of int. We named it PTR, store it in it or the address of edge. Now if we want to access the value stored at the address of the pointer here, then for that we will use star operator which we call value at address.Operator i.e. it will take out the value of whatever address is stored in that pointer. So it took out the value of 2 10 i.e. 22 and we assigned 22 to our new variable edge, so it goes here and gets stored. So, in this way, our points work. Let s try it once by writing a small code of it. First of all, we will declare a variable edge in which we are going to store 22. Now after that.We are going to create an integer pointer int star path i m per edge. Now here we can apply this star with an integer or with our variable. Both the syntax are fine and after that what we will do is create a new variable underscore edge and write star ptr in it. What we will do once is print its value. Percentage d a a save and run. So here we have 22 printed and it is light.Let us understand what happened, we had created a variable Edge 22. For that, we created a pointer. What is a pointer? It points to that memory location. It has stored the address of the memory location of Edge within itself. Now if we have to access the value stored at that address, we will extract the value of the address that is on the pointer from it and we put that value in Edge. In the new Edge, when we got the new Edge printed,So the old value came back to us because we had stored the same here, so 22 got printed and came to us, so the syntax of our pointer works in this way. Now what do we do, let s talk in a little detail about how we declare the points. We are reading everything very basic and very easily. I am trying to explain everything once or twice because it helps in getting the things stuck in the mind.Then you will not need to revise again and again. We hear the same thing two three times and it gets stuck in our mind. Now first of all, when we declare pointers, the type of pointer to be declared depends on which variable you want to point to, meaning if you store the address of an integer variable then you will have to write int star ptr, if you want to use character.If you want to store the address of a variable, you will have to write character star ptr. If you want to store the address of a floating variable inside the pointer, you will have to write float star ptr i.e. int edge e equal. 22 If we have to store its address as edge, then we will use this. If we have written character star e equal to est risk, if we have to store its address as a variable, then we will write this and if we have written float price e.Equal to 1, so if we have to store the address of the price, then we will be writing this. The type of the pointer depends on what type you have stored the address in it. If you have stored the address of integer type, then you will have to write int. If you have stored it of character type, then you will have to write character star. If you have stored it of floating type, you will have to write float star. The next thing that we will talk about is the format. Now whenever we print the points, we will have to writePointers are not normal variables. If you write int star ptr, it is not that whenever you get it printed, you will be able to write percentage d because there is no integer value stored inside it, there is an address stored inside it and address has its own type. For the type of address, we have to write percentage p. Percentage p means pointer address inside c. Now this one is specific. Let us guess, but whenever you write percentage p, a strange value will be printed. We will write it and see how it will be printed, but the strange value that is printed, sometimes we also write it with the help of percentage y, that is, here we will usually get hexadecimal value. If the address of the pointer is stored in hexadecimal form in the system, but if we want it in the form of normal numbers, thenWe cast the type, this percentage is y for unsigned int and percentage is p for our pointer address, so sometimes the pointer address may not look strange, hence we get it printed by giving it percentage as u. We will be learning both, we will see by doing both, we will also understand the differences in both with the help of code. What do we do first of all, let us look at our little syntax. First of all, we will see this line written in it, print a percentage p.Meaning, we are going to print the value of a pointer, we are going to print a memory address, after that it is written end . Whenever we write end and after that we write the name of a variable, meaning end is the address of, then we get the address of that variable. Now what is the type of address? Percentage p, then we will print the address. In the next line, we have written ptr . Now the pointer will also do the same, if M is the percentage edge, we will get it.If we give an address then the pointer also gives us an address so the percentage p in that too and if we want to write the address of the pointer i.e. the pointer will also have an address like if the edge had an address then we have stored the address of the edge in the pointer but the pointer is also standing on some land and the pointer also has its own plot so it will also have an address. If we have to get that address printed then for thatWe will also use percentage p, that s why if we specify it here, then what we have done is that we have created a variable which has 22 inside it and have stored the address of that variable inside a pointer. Now we will get things printed one by one. First of all, we are learning the printing of the address, how to print the address, then we will write percentage p, after that we will write m percent as, let s save it and let s do one.Once run, this is some value that has come to us. Here, we also put a basilisk. This is the value, this is the value of the address of the edge. This is the format, it is called hexadecimal format. Now it is possible that when you print in the machine, you get some other different value, then there is no problem in that. Memory addresses are different according to different systems, so your address and my address can be completely different.There is no problem in it for variables, but the format is a little difficult to read, so what can we do? We can convert our entire address from hexadecimal to unsigned int. If we convert it into unsigned int, then it will throw a warning that this is not the right way to do these things, but to make it easier to read, that is why what it did is convert this address into this number.So if we look here, we can assume that this is our memory address. Now even if we print the percentage, the percentage will not make any sense for us. But one thing is clear that this is the address. Now what will we do, we will try the same thing. Let s do this percentage for PTR. Let s comment out. Print F, Percentage, A, and PTR. Save. These are some warnings being thrown, but we will ignore them.Will ignore Here we saw one thing that when we got the address edge printed then the value printed and when we got the PTR printed PTR i.e. the value of this variable, then both of them are the same because whatever address of the edge was now ultimately stored inside the PTR, hence both the values are the same and after this if we want to print the value of our PTR.What will we write for the address on M i.e. the address of PTR, let s save it too. Now let s run it. These are the first and second values, both of them are the same because both EDGE and PTR hold the same value, but whenever you print the address of PTR, this value is different. You will notice that the last two digits are different, they are the same, so both of them have the same address.value and its address value That is, the address of PTR is different, so in this way we get our address printed. Next let s talk about how to print the value of the address stored on the pointer, in this we will be learning about the value at address operator. Now first of all, if we have to print the value of edge, then we already know that we need to do percentage d because edge is of integer type.If it holds the value then we will write Percentage D. This is the most normal but if we have to print the point value at pointer then we will put star in front of it. This asterisk means value at address, so whatever address is inside the pointer, whatever value is above that address, it will be printed. So we know that our address inside the pointer is 1020 and stored above 1020.This is our edge variable in which our edge is 22, so what will it do, first it will go to this address, then it will go to the value at this address, then it will print this value, so 22 will be printed here too, 22 will be printed here too, now let s see the combination of both, here first of all we wrote the address of edge, from here we have the address of edge, then we wrote star Eric s value at that address, then edge sAddress has come 210 it will say give me the value on it then what is the value on 2 10 then it will come here first of all the address of the edge is the address of the edge is 1020 and it will say value at 1020 give me the value at 1020 what is this 22 so here also we will have only 22 printed, let us verify it with the code first of all we haveWe had learned how to print the address. Now we will learn how to print the value. So to print the value, first of all we will write print F Percentage D because every time we are going to print the value, every time our percentage will be type D. First of all we print the edge. Back sl a control s. When we printed the edge, we got 22 printed normally. But what are we going to do now? Now we will store the value of the address which is on the pointer. Infact thisLet s do Control C, Control and End Control. Here we will write Value at Address PTR and here we will write Value at Address Address ofWe are paying a plot, that is why every time we are printing the value of the people living in the same plot, that is, we are getting 22 printed, so I hope that this syntax will also be clear to us that ast risk ptr means pointer value, address, if we put it in front of the pointer, then which value is printed and if we put asteris in front of m percent edge, that means take out the address and then put ast risk, then which one?The value is printed. The next thing we will be talking about is a practice question which will make things more clear. In this question we have to find out the output. Our question is something like this, first of all, what we have done is that we have created a pointer with the name ptr and have created an integer x. Now inside the pointer, we have put the address ofA variable x, now the address ofWe have stored zero inside 2000. Here something like this has happened, this line of ours is very important which we need to pay attention to. What is happening in this line, whatever address is there inside PTR, we will go to that address and store zero there. If there is 2000 inside PTR, then we will go to 2000 and store zero there, so this is the way we have done the work here. Now what are we doing with x?If we are printing the value and the value of PTR, then what will be the value of x here? The value of x will be 0 because we have indirectly added Row has been stored, you will notice that there is no line here in which x is written as something but still we have assigned the value to x. How we have assigned it with the help of this line because here we have indirectly accessedNext, what we did is, we code this part and verify it. First of all, we create an integer variable in which we are storing nothing in the beginning and apart from that, we create a pointer with the name PTR. Now what we are doing inside PTR is storing the address of our X and then indirectly storing it inside the address which is on PTR.If we are zero then first of all we will try to print the value of percentage d b nWe have zero printed in both the cases because both the values are zero. Now let s move to the next line. The next line seems even more important to me. The next line is called Star PTR 5. Let s mark this line as important. Break it up a bit and it says Star PTR Star PTR 5. What does it mean to say that the address in the pointer means the valued address at the pointer?Means 2000, whatever is the address, whenever we are writing star PTR here, it means x star PTR. What is the address ofIt will become 5. Now the value ofSo five will be printed here and here also we will have five. Let us verify this also. Now we have both the values which were zero earlier, now they have become five. The next thing that we will talk about is the next line which is a little more important. Let s see how now here we are using increment operator. What is this increment operator doing? If we break it down then star ptr star ptr 1, this method means andWe discussed that whenever Star PTR comes, it means a variable. Star PTR i.e. x 1 x, then the value ofPTR is getting plus. If PTR is not getting plus, then the pointer is not plus. Star PTR is not getting plus. The value on the address on the PTR pointer is getting plus plus. Here we get our value printed, we should get six and here also six should be printed. Compile it again and run. So now we have finally got six and star. PTR is also six, so how do we write the pointer.What value is stored in the pointer, how to print it, how to get the address of the variable, how to get the value of the variable from the address, how to get the value from the address stored on the pointer, we have explored a lot of things and these are the questions that you should be asking about the pointer. Whether your college students are asking you or the recruiter is asking the same, there will be a similar form in this form which can be changed to give you an M somewhere.Will give it somewhere At some places they will give you a slip, at some places they will ask you to take out the address, at some places they will ask you to take out the valued address and mostly children go into this confusion. The best way is to look at the basics that we have just discussed and if there is even a slight confusion, then look at it once more. After that, ask a lot of questions on the points. Once we ask a lot of questions, especially a day before the paper or a day before our interview, then everything will be clear.Now the next thing we will talk about about points is pointer to pointer. Pointer to pointer is a variable which is storing the address of another pointer, so the variable that stores the memory address of another point, for example, our memory is inside it, first of all we created a variable A inside which is stored 22, the address of this variable is 210 now.We created a new pointer PTR inside it, what we thought was that let s point it towards the edge, the address of the edge is 20110, it will come here, now this pointer will also have some address, 20113, like we had seen after printing it, there was some value, now we want to store the address of this pointer in a new variable, how will we store it, we will create a new variable.Pointer to Pointer P PTR Inside this, we will store the address of PTR, so it will be stored here by coming to 20113 and it will also have its own address. Now this chain can continue, maybe we create a new pointer to pointer which will store its address, then create a new one which will store its address, then this chain will continue. Now we have come to the last level of the chain i.e. pointer.Pointer to Pointer We very rarely use pointer to pointers in real life programming but it is important to read them to build up some concept because recruiters can ask if they have seen the top five pointer questions from any website before the interview or your college professor can put it in the syllabus, then how to declare pointer to pointer, use it, let s talk about its syntax.Like we used to write pointers in the form of int star ptr and it has become pointer to pointer, so here instead of one star we will simply put double star, it means pointer to pointer, so if the address of an integer pointer is to be stored then int double star ppt r. If the address of a character pointer is to be stored then character double star ppt. If the floating pointer of a floating variable is to be stored then int double star pptIf you want to store the address, then float double star PPT. Now this PPT R is the name of a variable, which means it is not necessary that you keep PPT. For understanding, I have written it in this way to show it as pointer to pointer. Character double star double star star. This is also a pointer to pointer because its type is character star star. Now let s talk about a practice question. Now pointer toLet s actually create the pointer and see what we will do. Let s create a variable. First of all, the variable is of floating type. This time let s make the price. The value inside the price is stored 00. Now we will create a new pointer float star PTR PTR will store the address of price. Now we will create another new pointer. This will be pointer to pointer i.e. PPT R. We will store it inside PPT R. We will store the address of PTR then PTR.If we took the address of a and stored it inside P PTR, then I hope this chain will be clear to us that our pointer stores the address of the normal variable and the pointer stores the address of the variable, our pointer to pointer, so this change keeps going on. Now let s understand it a little more in the form of a question. Our question is print the value of a from its pointer to point. Here we have any one.Variable would have been given. Suppose int a i 5 y a variable has been given. Now we have been given its pointer to pointer, which means first of all we would have created a pointer to it int ptr in which we would have stored the value address of aa, after that we would have created a pointer to it p ptr in which we would have stored the address of ptr. Now we do not have both of these but we have this only with the help of this ppt r.If you want to get your number five printed, how will you get it printed, let s understand it a little with the help of a diagram. First of all, assume that you have There is a variable Aa which is stored at a memory address inside which the value is stored. Our five. Apart from that you have PPT R. There is an address stored inside PPT R. PTR also has an address stored inside it. Its address was suppose 2000. 2000 is stored inside PTR. Its address was 2010. So inside PPT R, 2010 is stored and its address is 2020.Some variation of this method is going on. Now whenever the value has to be calculated, first of all a bell should ring in our mind and we should remember an operator. Which is the value at address operator i.e. our est risk. Whenever the value has to be calculated, the est risk has to be remembered. Whenever the value has to be calculated, M percentage has to be remembered. How will Aris be useful? We know what Star PTR gives. Star PTR gives us i 5.Value i.e. five gives us, then if we do Star PPR then what will it give us? Star PPR will give us what is stored inside this address, that means from Star PTR we will come here and come to the value stored at this address, but if we do Star Star PPR, what will happen then a chain will run. How will the chain run? First of all, with the help of this first star, we will come here from 2010 and will come on this 2000 of the second star.From the help, we will come here from 2000 and then come to this five, then we have to do double double star means value at address twice, by jumping the values twice, after that we can print our i 5. Let s try it practically with the help of the code. If it is not so clear yet, comment out this portion. Let s create a variable int aa inside which five is stored. Apart from that, we will create a pointer variable.Int Star PTR It is the address of A and we will create a point to pointer P PTR inside which we will store the address of PTR Now what to do is to get the things printed, normally a single thing, we will get it printed Which is Star Star P PTR Terminal compile and run So Star Star PPT R We got it printed and it got printed for us Five I hope its logic is clear that Star PTR means I will get the value.Will give the address of PTR and if star is converted to star PTR then it will give the value of the address stud on PTR i.e. it will give the value of five which we got printed and it was very simple to understand. Always keep in mind the two operators, where to use star when value is required and where to use em percent when address is required. We will be given here and there combination of both of these everywhere. Now the next topic we will talk about is this.It is a very important topic whenever we have to understand programming and all the topics we have learned till now, C is usually taught in schools and colleges first because these concepts are not only in C, you will see them somewhere in all the programming languages, you will go out to study Java, you will go out to study C , you will go out to study JavaScript, let s say you are studying any other programming language like Go, you are studying C, etc.These concepts also exist inside which we are studying here, the concepts of our functions, the concepts of our loops, the concepts of our if else, even in some languages, you will be able to play with the pointer and now we are going to read about the function call which is an important topic in itself, our function call is when we write the calling statement, like we have created a function sum, for that we have written sum of a and b functions.There are two types of calls inside c, first is call by value and second is call by reference. First of all, let us see the example of call by value. We have already read call by value. There is nothing new in it. I will show you something which we have already read. And then I will tell you that it was called call by value, so let s write a normal program. Here you might be thinking that suddenly with pointer.How to jump into the function, but now we will learn how functions are related to pointer. So first of all we declare a function, we will name it Square Void Square Int A, we also write its definition Void Square Int n, what will this function do, it will store n in n itself and then we will print the percentage D. Here we write square e equal to b A and n What did this function do, it is an integer.took n Now by multiplying n by n, we stored the square inside the same variable and then we got the square printed. Now inside the main function, we take a number int number e equal to 4 and for that we call square. If we call square, we pass the number in it and then once after getting the square printed, we get that number printed again. Percentage D number is just a number. We made a number, got the square printed of the number and again.After getting the number printed, let s run it once and analyze the output. Then we got 16 in the square and the value of the number was four, but if we look carefully, inside the square function, we had changed the end. This number has been sent here. So, we had changed its value to 4 by 4 i.e. 16. So when our n went back, it should have become 16, so why is it four?Now we have already discussed this, this is four because whenever we pass a value, by default inside C, it is passed by value, which means copies are made. We had discussed this concept in the functions that this number is an argument. When we pass it inside a function, then what will the formal parameter do, that is, the parameter will make a copy of this argument and all the changes that happen inside this function.Changes take place in the copy, it is similar to that if your message remains the same, then after receiving the message, your friend can do anything with it, he can forward it, delete it, save it, but the message will not change from my side, I will have the message as it is, so what we have is the main function and the friend is our square function. Whatever we do with the square function parameters, he can take the parameters of the main function as arguments.That s why the value of the number remains the same, but if I say that we can pass the variable in a different way in which it is possible to change the value, then it will be a different type of function call, then by default the behavior is that the copy is passed to us. We call this concept call by value, which means we pass the value of our argument as argument.If we are calling our function, then its definition is that when we pass the value of variable as argument, so all the functions we have written till now were call by value, but if we have to pass the variable, then we can also call by reference. How to call by reference? When we pass the address of the variable as an argument, let s take an example of this, let s create another function which we will name.Underscore Squa This is our new square function, inside this also we will have an integer JAR A Void Underscore Squa Int n Now what we will do here is write int star n because we are going to take a pointer here, if we send the address then there should have been a pointer variable to receive the address and here we will write the same thing star n star n star n and here also we will write star n so this is a square function which takes the pointer.This means that it will take the pointer of a number, it will take its address, now all the things will happen directly with that address and here what we will do inside the function is that first of all we will call the underscore square and inside this underscore square we will pass the address of our number, after that let s print our number again and see what value will be printed of our number. Now let s run this code once and then we will analyze that code, so first of all here.So 164 was printed because we had called the first square but called the second square so the first square was printed as 16. When we came back our number had become four but this time we called the square as 16, so what it did was that it changed our number also i.e. it was four, it was made 16, so our points do something like this when we pass them inside the function. How to pass the points? First of all, whatever function we are creating, it is in its parameters.Will write star n means a pointer is going to come here. Pointer is going to come here i.e. we are going to give the address of a variable here for which we need a pointer variable to store it. So when we wrote the definition, we wrote int star n inside it. Now this is int. Star n, which is n, is a pointer variable. How to access the value whose address is being stored by the pointer? By ast risk i.e. from star, the value at address of n will be equal to the value at address of n multiplied by the value of address of n. So here what we are doing in a way is multiplying it 4 by 4 and storing it back at the same location which is at the address end.And then we stored that value, now what did we do, when we went back, that value got changed because we made changes directly inside the address, here we made changes inside the copy, but in this function, we made changes inside the address itself, so when we went back here, the value of the number had changed, let s understand this with the help of a little diagram and understand what happened to us, we had a variable whose name was number.The address will be, suppose its address was 2000. Now the value was stored inside the number. We made a function call. In the function call, we created a pointer. What did the pointer do? The pointer has kept its name as n. The pointer has stored the address of 2000 because we had passed the end number. We will carefully look at this function of ours. Inside the line, we gave the address of the number to the underscore square, so it gave the address of the number.Now whatever changes will happen will be above the address. If we have written star n added by star n then it means that we are accessing this four i.e. it means number and it also means number, so here we have multiplied four with four. Now when we stored it back in star a, it means that we have changed the address itself, so here we have cut the four and stored it as 16, so the address is the same n.The address inside is still 2000 because the plot does not change, the address of the plot is still 2000 but the people living inside it have changed, that is, now we have made 16 out of four. Now whether we are in the square function, in the main function or in some new function, now that value has changed permanently inside this address, now the old value will not come back, so in this way when we change the addressAnd we pass a pointer variable and stores it and we can make changes within the address itself, we call it call by reference, that is, the function call we saw here is called call by reference. We pass the address of the variable as argument. We will pass the address of our variable as the edge argument, it will be stored inside the pointer and when we can make changes inside the original value, that is called by.For reference, these are two types of our function calls. The best example to learn this and understand it better is our swap function. Swap two numbers a and b. This is our next question. Swap means interchange or exchange, like the value of a is three, the value of b is five, then at the end what will the swap function do? It will make the value of a five and the value of b will become three by interchanging.Will give the values of both. Now let s see once how we actually do the process of interchanging. We already have two variables inside our memory. The first is our A variable. The second is our B variable. The value is stored inside A. Three are five inside B. Whenever we have to swap something, we will use a third variable. To understand this, let s take another example like we have a bucket of water.In which 3 liters of water is stored, there is another bucket inside which we have five liters of water stored. Now we have named this bucket, we have named it B. What we have to do is that in A we need 5 liters of water. In B, we need 3 liters of water, so how will we bring a third bucket. This third bucket has arrived and the third bucket is empty. There is nothing inside it, so either we first pour the water of B in it, then B will become empty, after that, pour the water of A in B. Now if we do this, then our water will come inside B.3 liters of water, this bucket was empty, there is 5 liters of water of B inside it and we had emptied A into B, so now A is empty, now what will we do if we pour the water of this bucket back inside A, then finally 5 liters will come inside A, 3 liters will come inside B and this bucket will be completely empty, so in this way, whenever we have to interchange the water of two buckets, we bring a third empty bucket and Similarly here, if we have to interchange the values of two variables, then we will bring a third empty variable. Let us assume that the third empty variable is called temporary variable, that is, we have given it a name, t is temporary, it is empty. Now, first of all, what will we do, will we put the value of a in the value of t or the value of b, we can do anything, that means the value of a has been stored in t, now the value of a is stored in t.Inside we will put the value of b and inside b we will put the value of t, then either we can write this or if we write in this way, both of them are correct. Vergus basic point is this, either empty a first or empty b, then in that way we will be able to swap both the values, so we are going to write two verges, call by value in one of spring, call by reference in the other, let s see which one is correct, first try spring.Let s call by values, create a function void swap. There will be two variables inside it, int A and int B. Inside the main function, the value of A is three, the value of B is pa and we write our definition void swap int A, int B. What we have to do is to create a temporary variable t. We will put the value of A inside it. We will put the value of B inside A. We will put the value of A inside B and print it here.Let s make it so that after swapping, a is equal to percentage d and b is equal to percentage d and b. In fact, those who are using variables inside the main function, let s keep it asIf the value is changed then it will be spinged here but we do not want sping here. We need the spring to come inside our main function and get the values done. So here we will see whether the value ofActually there will be swap or not and if the correct answer comes out then it means that you have understood the points well. If not then it means that you need to go and see some of the concepts behind, then once we write the answer, we have made a 5 and b 5. This happened because here we should have written a temporary variable, let s clear it and if we compile and run once again then the value of a should be five.And the value of b has become three. Here in the beginning what wasWhat will we do, we will take pointer int star A, int star B, call by reference void under swap, inside this we are coming to points of and pointer of B. Now if we have variables in pointer, then whatever we make temporary, we can also make it in the form of pointer. Now here we will create a new variable called temporary T. Inside this T, first of all we will store the value of A and the value of A and then the key of A.In the value we will put the value at address of b. Now in the value at address of b we will put the value of t. So what we did here is the pointer which is pointing towards a. Where the pointer of a will take out the value of a and put it inside t. Now the value at address of a will come inside t. The value which is inside b will come inside a and the value at address.The value which is stored inside t will come in the value at address of b, so in this way we are doing address by address springing. Now let s check it again here, let us underscore it, now we have printed the value of x and y. Here we will have to pass the address ofGiven that the value of x is now five and the value of y is now three, it is possible to call by reference. With the help of this, because we passed the pointer, we passed the address and we created points inside our function, that is why the value which is at the address is interchanged, so our function can return only one value, but when we want multiple values, then what we can do is pass the address of a variable inside it and get the changes done there, store it inside that variable and bring it back.The function will not have to return anything and you will get your value, then in this way we use call by reference when we have to return multiple values from one function. We do not return those values with the help of return, we return them with the help of points. So I hope this concept will be clear now, the next question which we will talk about, the next question says will the address output be the same. Inside this question we haveFunction we have created a void print address in which we are passing int n and what does our function definition say print the address of n. We have taken a variable n inside the main function. We have printed the address of n here. So there will be a memory location inside our memory which we have named n. Value is stored inside n. Suppose the address of four is 2000 so whenever you have to analyze and not the output.Will it be the same or what should be the output of this question, then take an example and in the example, assign any of your addresses, so here we have assigned 2000 addresses, so here we will have 2000 printed, we know this, then we have called, passed the print address in it. Now when we have called the print address, let us look carefully, this is call by value, whenever call is by value.When a copy of a variable is made then this second copy is made, the name of this copy will also be n but its address will be something else because 2000 is already a variable so it will be 21, it will be 2010, its address can be anything, its address can be 5000, can be 10000, so this is a copy of n for our print address function and the value inside it has been copied, so itsOur char has been stored inside also by copying. Now here we are printing the address of this n, so the address of this n that will be printed will be 2000 months, so obviously this address of ours and this address can never be the same in call by value. Yes, if this call was by reference, when we are talking about the same variable, if we are talking about the same memory location, then our addresses would have been the same.Let s verify this too. With the help of code, first of all create a function with the name of void print address and take a variable n in it. Now what to do is store the value inside n inside the main function. We will call four more print addresses in which we will pass n. Let us also create this. Inside the print address print address, we have integer n coming and here we will print the value of integer n.If we are going to get it done, then the address of n is percentage Y B S A and here we will print the address of n and we will copy the same line and write here. Now when we will run this code, now open our terminal, compile and these warnings are coming because our pointer is printed with percentage p but we have typecast it in unsigned int, so do not take so much tension about warnings, now look carefully.First of all, if we call the print address, then the statement there will run, then the value of this integer n, its address is printed here and then the address of our original n, which is n inside the main function, is printed and both the addresses are different, this is our call by value here, if the call was by reference, that is, there would have been a star here, there would have been a star here too and here we print the value of n.Getting it done means getting the value stored in this pointer printed and from here we are passing it in the print address. So the address of n has become call by reference. Now let us analyze our output. Now both the addresses that have come inside the output are the same because call by reference has been done. It means now we are talking about memory location. Now directly we are talking about the plot whose address we know, now it is not about the name of that variable.If it is going on then inside the call by value where The memory address is different. Our values are copied. In call by reference, the values remain the same. We access the memory address directly. This is a very important distinction to remember. The last question in the points that we will talk about is Write a function to calculate the sum product and average of two numbers. Print that average in the main function. Along with the average, the product and the sum are also called in the main function.If you want to print inside the function, then we will create a function here which will take two numbers a and b and will calculate the sum of both i.e. a b will calculate the product a b and will calculate the average a b 2 will return three values to the main function and what we have learned is that there is only one value returned from the function but whenever a situation comes to return multiple values, then use the points there.Points come in the form of a save. Let s write its solution once and see how the points are useful in the situation. First of all, inside the main function, we will create two variables. The first variable is A. We take A. The second variable is BB. We take the value of B. Now let s create a function. Void does work. It is doing some work for us, meaning someone is doing calculations. In this we will take two values int A.And int b s parameters, now let s define what we will do do work int a int b we first calculate the sum of both int sum e a b then calculate the product of both int prod e a malla ba b then calculate the average of both to calculate the average we will write a b divide ba 2 so in this way we have written three variables but we cannot return these three so what can we doLet s define these three variables inside our main function and pass the points, like here we will make sum product and average of all three, but these three points will be passed like here, that means three points will be passed here, int star sum int star product and int star average, so here also same values will come int star product product int star, first sum will come then int star product and then int star average. Now hereWe do not need to define because this variable is already created inside the main function. We want to change the star of product because this is the sum, this is the product and this is the average. These are the three points and if we access the value at the pointer with the help of asteris, then we will store it there a p b. We will store it in this product.2 So now let s call do work, we will pass address of sum, address of product and address of our average. After that, when we come to the main function, we will print all the three values. Sum is equal to percentage, product i is equal to percentage d and average is equal to percentage d and here first of all sum then product then average. I hope this thing will be clear to us.That inside this function, we have passed by reference, we have passed by reference of these three variables, we have passed by value of these two variables, we do not want any changes in the values of a and b, inside the main, they normally passed by value but we wanted the values inside these three, so we passed them by reference and calculated their values, calculated and passed the values inside the main function.If we store it and get it run, then the sum of our three and five has come, the product of both has come to 15 and the average of both has come to four, that is, 5 3 8 and divided by 2 is 4. So in this way, when we need multiple values in the return, inside the second function, then what to do is pass by reference. You will pass by reference, you will send that empty value of that variable, store the value inside it and take it back.In this way, points are very useful. In our normal programming, I hope that the concept of points would have been clear to us to a great extent. We have covered all the basic concepts very easily. There are some one or two concepts but we will cover them in the next chapter when we will be talking about arrays. Now we will gradually understand the use of points when we will structure the data. Array is a structure of ours. About the array.We will be learning in the next chapter till then we will Or you can do some homework problems and ask questions, improve your skills and definitely revise the chapter so that we do not forget things. We have given notes for your convenience. And let s move towards our next chapter. Now we are going to start our chapter seven in which we will read about arrays. If we talk about classical definition of array then arrays are collection ofSimilar Data Type Stored at Contiguous Memory Locations Like if we have to store a value in a memory location, then we get it stored with the help of a variable. We take a variable, it reserves a memory location, inside it we store some data and give some name to that memory location which is our variable. If we have to store a lot of data of the same type, suppose here we have an integer.But if we have to store three integers, then we want those three integers to be stored one by one, in which we assume that we are able to store different dates and if we give a collective name to these three, then the structure of this type is called array structure or array. If we look at its definition, it is a collection of similar data types, that is, you can store three ints or five ints.Only two ints and one float can be stored together, five floats can be stored together, five characters can be stored together, but different data types cannot be stored together in the form of a collection. Stored at Contiguous Memory. Lock Continuum means continuous, so this data is stored inside the memory in a continuous fashion, that is, it is stored one after the other, so it becomes easy to access it, so whenever we have multiple variables.If we have to store them, then instead of giving them different names, we create an array, like if you see an example of this, by writing it in the code, suppose we have to store the marks of three students, then if we do not have any structure like an array, then we would normally be creating three variables, int marks one, we will store physics marks in it, then int marks two, we will store chemistry marks in it and then int marks th.Now to access these three, we need different variables, but if I say that I can access all three values from a single variable, then we will call that type of structure as array. How to write array, we will write the type of which we are going to create an array, then we will write Marxus, then we will put square brackets which show that the structure that we are creating is an array and after that ourWe will write the marks 97 98 89 in this way, this is the syntax of writing the array in which we have stored three values inside a single variable, then these values will be stored one after the other in the memory and all the data will go inside those three blocks. Now if we talk about the syntax of writing the array, if we want to create an integer type array, then first of all we will write the type int, after that we will write ourAfter that, we will write the name of the array in square brackets, then inside the square brackets, we write a number, that number is the size, that is, what size do we want the location, if we want three integer values, then we will write three, if we want five, then instead of this we can write 10, if we want 10, then we can write 100, then in this way we will create an integer array whose size is three. If we want to create a character array, then we will write character as the name of our array.Then square brackets and inside we will write how many characters we have to store in it. If we want to make a float, then we will name it in square brackets and inside we will write what should be the size. How many floats have to be stored. So as soon as we write this statement, int marks is three, then a memory location with the name of marks comes inside our memory where these one 2 3 three blocks are reserved for us and the size of these three blocks is equal to one integer. We had read the data types.That takes four bytes inside the memory, so the size of each block here is equal to four bytes, this is also four bytes, this is also four bytes and This location is also four bytes, so we get three blocks of four bytes each. Now we have by convention, we call this first block zero th block, the first block is called one, the second block is called one and the third block is called two. This is by convention. This is called zero based indexing. There are some languages in which there is one based indexing, but C P, Java are such languages in which zero based indexing is zero based.That is, we will not call the first position one, if we say zero, then we have to always keep this thing in mind. Now let s talk about how the array has to take input or output. So to take the input, first of all we have to write Percentage D, whatever type we are going to take the value input and we treat this mark of square brackets like a variable, that is, like the values of a normal variable, we write edge or marks one marks two, in the same way we write the value of the array.When we talk about a variable, we can write it Marks 0 Marks One Marks Two These will also be treated like a normal variable and inside this normal variable, if we have to take any value input then we will put address of operator in front of it. If we have to output its value then we will normally write the name of that variable. Now you will notice that we have written the name of the array, after that we have put these on the square brackets inside.A number is written in the input as well as in the output. This means that whenever we are talking about memory, suppose we have created an array named Marx which has three memory locations inside it, then we must have stored some value inside it. Now whenever we write row Marx square bracket 0, it means that we want to know this number or want to input it. If we write Marx of one, it means that we want to know this number eitherIf we are talking about or want to input, and we write marks of two, it means that we want to know this number or are inputting it. So whatever number you write inside that line tells us about which position of the number in the array. If we talk about which number in the array, then whatever number we write inside square brackets tells us which number in which position in the array we are talking about. What do we do once we input and output an array for example?Let us see, for example, there was a Marx array, we will talk about its syntax as well, but let s remove it from here for a while and comment it out. First of all, let s create an array with the name Marx, the size of this array is three. Now we will input the marks of all the three subjects one by one, so first of all we write print statement, enter physics, scanf, first we will put percentage D because we are scanning an integer, then we will put the address of operator end.Marks of zero, after that the same process will be repeated three times. Now the marks of Chemistry and here the marks of Maths and the second time when marks will be taken input will be at zero position. So already we have taken the input of Physics marks. Now we have to store the Chemistry marks at the first position and the Maths ones at the second position and now if we want to print it then we will get it printed in this manner Physics E is equal to the percentage of Chemistry E.Equal to Percentage D Math E Equal to Percentage D and here Marks of Zero Marks of One So I hope it will be understood that Marks of Zero i.e. a single variable, only the value of zero position is required, only the value of first position is required and only the value of second position is required, let s save and run, so first of all we will enter the marks of Physics, then we will enter the marks of Chemistry.If we enter the marks of Maths then in this way the marks of all the three subjects have been stored position wise. In Physics we have stored 97 at zero position, in Chemistry we have stored 98 at the first position and in Maths we have stored 89 at the second position. If we go here that we have declared an array of three and we are accessing 0, one and two and we are going to access if three.Suppose we access three or here we write three that we will store the marks of Math in three, so let s compile it once and run it, we have stored the marks of Physics 97, Chemistry 98 and now like Math, we Suppose we are storing 89, in the same way, our program has aborted, which means it has ended, because an error has occurred and this is an error which is a run time error, meaning the compiler will not be able to check. If you make such a mistake, when you are accessing something bigger than the size of the array, then the compiler will not tell you that you are making a mistake, your program will tell you in the run time that you have made a mistake and will stop there like here.But we wrote three, whereas inside the array, the size is only three, which has gone to 0, one and two. Now for three, we needed to increase the size of this array to four, so we cannot write it because it will give us an error, that is why whenever we are creating an array, we have to pay attention that we are not going beyond our maximum index as far as we can go. Next we are going to talk about the practice question. We can answer this question very easily.To solve the question, it says, write a program to enter price of three items and print their final cost with GST, that is, we have to take the price of three items, now we can keep this price as floating value and have to give the final cost with GST, with each value we have to add GST on 18 and then we have to print the final value that will come, so let s see how we will do it. First of all, we have to enter the three items, that means weWe can create an array because all three items have the same type. Whenever we have to keep multiple values and there are more values and the same type, then we have to create an array there. So first of all we will create an array of floats which we will name as price of size three. Now write the print statement enter three prices. First of all we will scan our first price from percentage F i.e. m percent price of zero and in the same way m percent price of one and then print every time after that.Will get it done in fact Total price one is equal to two Here we will write price of 0 plus 0.18 multiplied by price of G In a way, we have added GST on 18 here in this way, we will repeat the same thing three times inside the price Here price two Here price r 1 multiplied by 0.18 ofv 2 multiplied by 0.18 We will save it, so this is our final or total prices with GST.And once we run it, here the format is Percentage F Percentage A. Now first of all we have to add three prices, so 100, 200 and 300, then these GST values have come to us. First of all, 118, then 236, then 354, these three prices have come. For some space, we could have also inserted Back S, let s save it and run it once again, so these three prices have come with.Added GST and total price can be done in this way. So here the biggest benefit that we saw by using Array was that we did not have to maintain three different variables. We created a single variable and from that all our work is running. When we are talking about similar data types, now let s move towards our next topic which is Initialization of Array. Now we saw that we can declare the array.After that, elements can be inserted in it, but the array can also be initialized with declaration, like if we create an int, then we can write it as int x and then x 10 or we can write it as intName your array then square brackets. Now pay attention that we do not need to write the size inside the square brackets because whatever elements we write on the right side will automatically give us the size of the array. After that on the right side we write curly braces and all the elements inside it i.e. if we have written three elements then it means we are creating an array of three sizes. Now either we can follow this syntax or we can also write the size then thisBoth the syntax are absolutely correct when we declare as well as initialize our array that an array named marks will be created, what will happen inside it, the first value will come here, the second value will come here, the third value will come here, this will be our zeroth position, this is the first position and this is the second position in this first position. The size of the int will be four bytes, the second will also be of four bytes and the third will also be of four bytes because the integer takes four bytes. Now if yours is a 32 bit machine or you are working on some other system then it may be that the size of the int according to your machine may be two bytes or something else but according to my machine the size of the int is four bytes, so whenever someone asks you to do the calculation, tell me the size, how much does it take?So you can adjust the int to four bytes or you may have given it inside the question or you can also ask the interviewer or teacher to tell me the size of the integer. As per the machine, there is no problem in it because the size can be different but inside this class we will carry four bytes, so if we have to find out the total memory reserve, how much memory is reserved by this array, then it will be our 12 bytes because it takes memory to store three integers.Total 12 bytes will be consumed inside, so in this way, if we ever want to know that character, if we have to store any character array inside which we are storing 10, then we know how much memory the character takes one byte and how many characters we are storing is 10, then how much memory we are taking is total 10 1 i.e. 10 bytes. In the same way, if we suppose we have to store another integer array in which we are storing role.Numbers and we have stored the roll numbers of 30 children, so we know that integer takes four bytes and we are storing them, so for 30 children, we are storing 30 integers. So the total memory consumed inside the memory is 30 4 that is 120 bytes. So such questions come many times in our college exams in which they are asked how much memory will be reserved, we have to tell it.The calculation is done in such a way that whatever our data type will reserve a single memory, multiply the amount of space reserved inside the memory by how much we have to store, that way, our total memory consumed, total memory reserved will come to us. Once we initialize an array inside the memory, then like here we have created a price. Instead of entering the value of this price directly, if we remove the initialization size, then this syntax would also be absolutely correct.Also fits your use case, you have to use the same syntax to initialize any array. Now the next topic we will talk about is pointer array in array. By array array we understood that in which we play with plus minus multiply divide module. Here we are talking about pointers because arrays are related to pointers in some way or the other.After we understand, we will understand how they are related, then we cannot do all these multiply, divide, module within the points, but there are some arithmetic operations which we can perform, these include our increment operator and decrement operator, that is, we can plus or minus the value of the pointer, like first of all, if we look at the case, in this we have created an integer variable edge inside which we have stored 22. Suppose this edge variable is something in our memory.In this way, where 22 is stored and this is 2000, here the memory location is now what we are doing is we are creating a pointer which points to the edge, so this pointer must be created somewhere, that means there will be another location created in the memory whose name will be pointer where we have stored 2000 and it will also have its own location 4010. Now we have made the pointer plus plus, so now we have to tell where the pointer is pointing.By converting the pointer to plus we mean that the pointer is equal to pointer 1, but whenever we increment or decrement the pointers, there is a special thing and their value is not 1 or 1. Whenever and is written, it means to increase a data type, that is, if the pointer is of integer type, then it will increase by the size of the integer. If the pointer is of character type, then it will increase by the size of the character.If the pointer is of float type or double type, then it will increase by that size. Here our pointer is storing the address of an integer, so it means that four bytes will be added to it, like if the value of the pointer was currently 2000 and now we have made the pointer plus plus, then its value will increase. So this pointer which is 2004 will now start pointing here and not here because this memory is taking ultimately four bytes and the address of this memory location is also 2004 and the address of this memory location is 1996 so from here intuitively we can understand that if we did plus plus then it will move forward by one integer i.e. it will move forward by four bytes and if we did PTR minus minus then those four bytes.It will go back i.e. 2004, after that we again make the pointer minus minus, then it will come back to its original location that is 2000. Now let s verify it once by coding it. Inside our program, create a variable int age 22 and then create the pointer PTR by storing it inside PTR as the address of age. Now we have done this, first of all let s make PTR plus plus plus plus here.Got it done and before that let s print the value of PTR, PTR is equal to percentage unsigned int, we will show it in control C and again let s run the value of PTR, so first of all the value of PTR which was printed is 18 22802 and after that the last one which was printed was 156. Now if you look carefully, it will be within 152 and 156.What is the difference? If there is a difference of four, then we can understand that as soon as we did plus plus, what is the value. The integer increased by the size of the integer, that is, it increased by four bytes. Now here, if we again do minus minus PTR minus minus and then again print the value of PTR, then firstly the value of the pointer was this in which the last one was coming 112, after that if we did PTR plus plus then it came 116.It increased by four, after that when we changed it to minus, it came back to 112, that is, it came to the original memory location, because if we did minus again, then it has to be less than the size of an integer, that is, it is reduced by four bytes, so this is how our decrement and increment operators work. Let s take the second case inside the points. What is happening in the second case? We have created a floating variable, price inside which we have stored 20.00. Now what did we do?Made ptr point towards price and then made ptr plus plus, so this time when we will make pointer e equal to pointer pw, the size of this float will be the bytes of our float, so it will be increment and decrement according to the size of the float. Once we code this also, we will write here float price e equal to 100. Now this pointer which is making the price point, first we will use the pointer.We will print the original value, then the plus plus one and then the minus minus one. Then let s run the code. The original value was 904. As soon as we did plus plus, it increased by four bytes, four bytes of the float were added to it and as soon as we did minus minus, four bytes of the float were subtracted from it. In this way, the pointer also changes according to the size of the float. And if we take case three, then this is the case of our character. First of all.We created the character star, stored asteris inside it, after that created a pointer which is pointing to the star and then made PTR, so what is there in the character, there is one byte, the character is of only one byte, so whenever there is increment, it will actually be by one because one byte is incrementing, like here it is 2000, here it is 2001 and here it is 2002. If we created a variable named star in which star isIt is stored i.e. Asteris is stored and the pointer is pointing to it, so as soon as you change it to plus plus, the pointer will start pointing. If you change it to minus, then the pointer will start pointing. Let s verify this by coding it too. Here we will make care star equal to ast risk. In this we will store the address of the star and then again the values of the points. So first of all the value of the pointer should be the end.If you changed from 0 to sane to plus plus then it came to 0 to 8 because the character will be increased by one byte and if you did minus minus then it became 0 to s. So in this way if you have questions whether points have to be incremented or decremented then do not get confused in those questions. Just add the size. If 1 is written in the integer then it does not mean 1, it means 4.If it is written in float then it also means 4. If it is written in character then it means 1. Now there are two more things inside the pointer or matrix, the first of which is that we can denote one pointer from Other means from one pointer we can subtract the value of the other pointer like if we have written int ptr and is pointing to some integer edge and int ptr2 is pointing to some integer edge two then if we do pt2 pt1 then this is the operation which is lid. Along with this we can also compare two points i.e. the value of one pointer with the other pointer.You can compare it with the value, the answer will be either true or false. Let s see an example of this. Int A E 22 Int A E 23 So this is the underscore edge which is a separate variable. We make points according to this Int Star PTR. First we will print the difference Percentage Y B N PTR PTR and after that we will print the comparison. What do we do for comparison?Underscore PTR is there and we store the address of the edge in it. So now we will compare here whether both are same. How will we compare? Now the pointer which is normal PTR is storing the address of the edge and in Underscore PTR also the address of the edge is stored, so logically both of them have the same address value, so I is equal to I, then both of them will be equal to each other.Whatever the comparison is, it will return true, that is, if it returns one, then let s see the output. Save it once and run it. The difference is one and the comparison is also one. Now in comparison, one means true and in difference, one means by one integer. Like let s print their values too, percentage u, percentage u and here we will print PTR and under PTR. So first of all is the value of PTR.18700 which is ending under 264, the value of PTR is ending under 260, so when we did PTR PTR underscore PTR, then it is 260 minus from 264, then the difference should be of four but one is printed because it will not show four, it will not show the meaning in bytes, it will show the difference of how many integers there is between the two, so there is a difference of one integer.Which is equivalent to four bytes and it had to return true in the comparison because both are pointing to the same address, so obviously the value of both is the same. Now let s do a small thing and together here let s make the pay edge a character and make it a character pointer. Now this is a character pointer. In the comparison, obviously both will not return true. But analyze the difference once.If we do this then here we will see that the error came in the beginning itself because we cannot take the difference of an integer pointer from a character pointer. These two are not compatible types, so whenever the difference has to be taken, that is, one pointer will be minus the other pointer, then they should be points of the same type and not of different types, then this thing has to be kept in mind that whenever the difference of points is taken and the difference number does not come, it means the difference of the numbers in both.The difference comes in the data type, how many data types are there, we will talk about the next topic. The next topic says that we read in the pointer array, why we read it because the array is a pointer, the array we were reading is actually a pointer, how if we create a pointer int star pointer and make it point to the first location of the array i.e. the address of the array of zero, if we read the array of this pointer.If we store it inside, we would be doing something like this. We have already learned the syntax, but if we want to replace this whole part on the right side with an array, we can also do this, that is, the location on the first index of our array, the name of the array, is actually a pointer, where does the array need an index, like if I have an array, suppose there is an array named Marks which has a lot of numbers.Marks of the students are stored 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 So if you see the type of these marks then it is actually a pointer and where does it point? It points at the desired location of the array. So whether we write this line meaning the address of the desired location or we directly write the name of the array, both are equal, the syntax of both is different, but both mean the same, so in this way.The name of the array is a pointer and it is a very important thing which we have to remember because it is asked in the questions. Now if we have to travel on an array, i.e. go from one place to another, if there are 100 elements inside the array, then we have to move them one after the other. If we want to print a value, then how to do it? First of all, now we have learned something new that Er is a pointer and we have also learned that we can plus or minus the pointer value, so simply what will we do, we will run a loop, after running the loop, if our values, if our pointer is at zero in the beginning, then by adding plus plus to it, we will take it to the end and in the same way, minus minus.We can also bring it back while doing and here we will get our pointer printed from row to n. How to do it. Suppose you have stored the Aadhaar card values of 10 people. First of all, if we have to access things i.e. Scan F or Print F for input output, let us understand it with an example. Suppose you have created an array named Aadhaar which stores the Aadhaar cards of 10 people. Now for that you have to put a loop which will input the Aadhaar values of 10 people and thenIf we give the Aadhaar of 10 people in the output, then make a pointer for it. Where is the pointer pointing at the first index? So our pointer here is pointing at this location and in all the indexes, we have stored our values, so for the 10 values, we have created our entire array and named it Aadhaar. Now we have made a pointer which is pointing at the first location. Now what will this pointer do? First of all, the first location.But whatever value is there, it will be printed, then we will do pot pointer plus plus, then it will come to the second location, it will print the value here, then again we will do pointer plus plus, then it will come to the third location, it will print the value here, then again plus plus will come here, it will print the value. So in this way, we can run a loop. If we repeatedly plus plus a pointer inside that loop, then it will access the further memory locations.It will remain the same whether we are taking input or output. If we try this then we will understand better from the code. First of all, let us create an array named int as the base. Let s keep its size here because entering 10 numbers will be a bit inconvenient. Now first of all we will input the value of this array. To get the input, we have to input it with the help of a pointer, so let s create a pointer which is pointing to the first memory location.We put the address of the location in it, after that we put a loop int aa e will go from 0 to 10 aa p plus we print every time which index s value we need, percentage d index i, we need the value of the index and we scan that value, percentage d will give the address here, pointer plus aa ka, so here we have put a for loop and this for loop is going from 08 index to our ninth index.The value will be from zero till the last 10 days. We have started from zero because indexing is zero based. According to the array, now here we will print first which index we want the value of. So i is our index in a way and whoever has to be scanned, we will write in it pointer p a i.e. the pointer is pointing to the index.On the second position we will do t, on the second position we will do 3, on the third position it will keep on increasing one by one data type in this way, then scanning will be done here, then let s put another loop for the output i take 10 i print f d, the value is in the index, percentage d. Now here first we will print the index, after that we will print the value. To print the value, we can also do ptr aa, so let s do this once and then one more.If you see a slight change in the syntax, then we are putting 12 13 14 15 and 16 on the index. Here, if the size of our base is five, then we need to change it to five instead of 10 because this time we are making our array not of 10 size but of five size. Let s run it once again. 12 13 14 15 and 16, so now 12 has come on the first index.13 has come on the second, 14 on the third, 15 and on the fourth. 16, so all these values have been stored inside our array. Now here on star PTR 1, this is done, the way to do it with pointer. Here, we could have also done this on the basis of our index, so this is directly on the index a, whatever value is there, it is on the basis of If we calculate the address as per the address then we save it as well and while taking the input we could have done the same thing i.e. if Aadhaar is off then this Aa will keep changing and if we keep sending the address as per Aadhaar then this would also be the correct format to do things 12 13 14 15 16 So from this also we are able to take the same input and output whether we use points or we use these things normally i.e. square brackets.The output input will remain the same in both, we can just use whichever is more convenient for us, but one thing that we always have to remember is that the first index of the array is a pointer in itself, that thing should never be forgotten. The next thing that we will talk about is array as function argument. Now just like we can pass normal integer array, float, character as argument in the function, similarly we can also pass the array inside the function calls, i.e.We can create a function that prints the value of an array, then you put any array inside it, it will print its value, then in its argument you will have to define an array in its parameter. What is the format? First comes the function declaration. How will you declare such a function? Either you have written a normal function inside the argument, but inside the parameter you will write int array and then square brackets.Inside you do not need to give the size, meaning it can be of any size array, that is why for the size we will have to pass a separate integer n which will tell what is the size of the array or we can also pass it as a pointer. This is the method with square brackets and this is our method with points and both are correct. Here, int is the risk array, so it can be passed as a pointer also and inside the function call, you just have to write the name of the array, then we have toAlready know this is equal to m, but the array is of zero, so the value will be stored in this pointer, so the array itself is a pointer, it will be stored inside the pointer, so let s try it once, first of all, let s create a function, declare the function void print numbers, there is an array inside the print numbers and its size comes, so this array we defined with the help of square brackets and the size.Made a normal integer, now let s also define it, void print numbers inside which we have int array and int n. Now we will run a loop according to the size of the array which will run from zero to n, so here is the condition of less than n. Every time we are doing i p and will print the elements of the array, then print f percentage d b s t and here we will write a r r of i like in the next line.It is called bull t, it gives us the space of one tab, so whatever numbers will be printed, they will be printed after some space, so it will look good in this way and in the last, let s print the next line from B. Now inside the main function, we create an array in which there are some numbers 1 2 3 4 5 and 6s and let s print the numbers. Inside the call print numbers, we wrote the array as A as the first argument and wrote the number as six.There are elements inside it, we save it and run it, then our numbers written one after the other have been printed to us and here if we wanted, we could have made it a pointer by removing the square brackets, start PTR and here instead of int star PTR or infact PTR, if we keep it as AR, we run the code again and this time the same output has come to us, which means you can point to the array.If you want to keep it in your function parameters or you can keep the notation with square brackets, we will get the same output in both the notations. The next topic which we will discuss is Multi Dimension Arrays. That is, the arrays we have studied till now are wide arrays. They work in one dimension. What is dimension? Linear. In this way, we had our array but suppose we have to keep two arrays, then keep them one after the other.After that, if you want to keep three arrays, you can keep one array one after the other, so here we play with dimensions, that is, we need three arrays and the size of each array is 10, so I create a 2D array. In this way, we define the 2D array, first of all we will write its type int, after that we will write Then we will write its name as array, two square brackets, the number of square brackets inside the multi dimension array will tell how many dimensions it has, now till now we were writing int a a a of 3, so it meant that it has one dimension. Two square brackets means it has two dimensions and how will we define it on the right side. The outer square brackets will tell how much total data is stored inside. One square bracket means one array, the other square.The meaning of bracket is the second array, the elements in the first array are one and two, the second array is three and four, so this array will actually be formed. Now how to visualize it inside the memory, there are two ways, the first way is that we should visualize it in such a way that our one is stored here, two is here, three is here, then this is our array, this location inside this will be called 0 0, this will be called 01.If we say 10 and call it one one, then we can imagine it like a matrix. In 11th and 12th, there must be a matrix inside which we had some parts, so here it used to be Row here, one here, two here, row here one, here two , then in the same way, if one is written here, two is written here, three is written here or four is written, then it becomes 0, this becomes 0, and this becomes 10, this is done.There is some system of this type, so here also it means there is something similar inside the memory that we will call it zero zero, this will be called 0 and this will be called 10, this will be called and but how is it actually stored inside the memory, it is stored in this format i.e. first one will come then two will come then three will come then four will come then this zero will become zero this row one this one and this 1 1 Now if we have to accessSo how will we access the elements? If you want to get one array of 0, then it will be this value. If you want to get one array of 1, then this will be this value. If you want to get two array of 0, then this will be the value. If you want to get 1, then this will be this value. Then whenever we have to visualize a 2d array, we visualize it in the form of a matrix. Here this one will be our first array, this one will be our second.If there was a third array, it would come below it. This one would become our third array and the size of each array remains the same. The size of this array is also two. The size of this array is also two. The size of this array is also two. But we can make as many arrays as we want. We can make n arrays, we can make n 1, n 2, we can make as many arrays as we want, but the size of all will remain the same with us. And how to visualize the matrix?Now let s try one question from the help, now here we are talking about 2D arrays, we also have 3D arrays, there are 4D arrays, there are 5D arrays too but these are not used that much in programming. Mostly the questions you will get are going to come from 2D arrays. Now let s make a 2D array. We will make an array in such a way that we are storing the marks of three subjects of two children.This thing has to be kept in mind that if we have to store the marks of three subjects of two children, then let s create a 2D array named Marks, the size of which will be two and three, that is, two arrays are being made. In what way will it be stored in the memory, first three locations will come, after that three more locations will come. In this, the marks of three subjects of the first student will be stored. In this, the marks of three subjects of the second student will be stored. In this way, our array will be created in the memory.We write the marks of the first student i.e. Rote index. Here also there is Roe index. Here we can write the marks of the first subject of the first student. We can write 90 integer. If we will not write, now again the marks of the second subject of the first student is 89. Again the marks of the third subject of the first student are 78. In the same way we can write the marks for the second student also, so the second of the second student s second subject isWe can change the value of marks in the first subject of the student and in the third subject of the second student, then we will input these values in the same way and will output them in the same way as we were doing, like if we want to print the marks of the first subject of the first student, then we will just write print f percentage d marks of 0 zero, so this is telling that row e student i.e. our first student is zero of his eighth subject i.e. first.If we look at the subject marks it is 90. Once we get this value printed, in this way we can play with 2D arrays also. It depends on the use case, whether yours is such a case in which you need to create a 2D array. Mostly we are learning basic programming in C, so we will play only with large arrays. There will be a few questions on 3D arrays. We will not be going so much on 3D arrays. That is also possible.We have learned a lot in complex, so let us practice some of its questions. The first question we will talk about is write a function to count the number of odd numbers in an array, create a function, what will that function do, take an array as a parameter, pass it as an argument, and come inside the array and function and we will count how many odd numbers are there inside that array, like for example, for example, we have aThere is an array inside which some numbers are stored 1 2 3 4 5 and s Now there are odd numbers inside it th and 5 So the count and function that will be returned will be rr Let s write a function for that int count odd In this function we will pass an array of numbers and its size So the size is always to be passed Whenever we are passing an array, let s define the function count odd int array int size endLet s create a variable in which we will store the count. In the beginning, our count is zero, after that we run a loop. This loop will go from i 0 to i n. This loop will traverse the entire array. Traverse means it will travel and see. Through the loop, we will go inside the elements of the array one by one. We will check for each element. If array of i, we have got the value of that element from array of i, how will we check it? Module 2 is not.Equal T What came from here? First of all, we took out the element from the array of i and looked at it. Is it being multiplied completely? If it is not multiplying then it means reminder. If zero does not come then it means it is an odd number. So as soon as we get the odd number, we will count it. Plus plus count was zero in the beginning, that is, in the beginning we did not have a single odd number. We will check for each element whether it is odd, whether it is odd, whether it is odd.As soon as there is an odd, increase the count by one i.e. count plus plus and what will we do in the end, we will return our count, we make an array inside the main function, int array is equal to 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 and print the count, count dot, we will pass our array and our size which is s, save and run, so we have three returns, that means three inside our array.Odd numbers are present. In the same way, you can make a function to calculate even numbers. In the same way, you can make a function to calculate the multiple of three. If you calculate the multiple of five, then different types of functions will be written in the same way. If we have to perform functions on an array, then the next question which we will talk about is that we have an integer array given, numbers are stored inside it. 1 2 3 4 5 The question is for the given.Array what will be the following, so first of all we have to extract this value. For this array, let s visualize this array once. There will be some structure inside the memory, inside which we will have five values stored and there will be a pointer A arr which is pointing to the zeroth index here. We first extract arr2, so its value will be this is ar01 and this is aa 2, so its value will be what we have.Thr because here we are using value at address operator so it will print us three and then next we do ar5 so this is ar3 this is AR 4 ar5 will not exist in this array because it is only a five size array so there will be memory on some but it is not a part of our array so here we will get an error. Let s verify it by coding it once. Let s make an array of only five size.Inside this, first of all, we will print the percentage DB n, our AA 2 and then AR 5, three is printed in arr2, because there is three at this position, but row is printed at five, that means there is no valid value there, it is not a part of our array, hence row has deleted whatever value was lying there, now we will do next Practice Question 44 Practice Question 44 tells us right.Function to Reverse an Array We have been given an array. Suppose we have been given an array of size four. The values inside it are 1 2 3 4. We have given the value of this array. The values have to be reversed i.e. a final output array should come to us, there should be 4 3 2 and one inside it, so this is a very important question. There are many ways to do this question and we will discuss one of them classical way. The classical way is to exchange the first and the last, then exchange the first, then the second and the second last. If there is something in between then exchange the third and the third last. If we keep exchanging then our array will be.It will be completely reversed. How does one come in place of four? If one comes in place of four, one comes in place of four. One comes in place of two. Three comes in place of three. If two comes in place of two, three comes in place of three. If two comes in place of three, then our array is reversed. Now this same is the strategy. Now we are only talking about the strategy, not talking about the code. Now we will discuss the code in which way it will be written if we have an odd sized array.The pass array would have been like 1 2 3 4 and five. In this too, the same strategy would have been used. If you had exchanged one and five, here would have been five. Here would have been one. If you had exchanged two and four, here would have been four. Here would have been two. And if three had been exchanged with three, there would have been three. What was learned from this that the final array that came was 5 4 3 2 and 1, so our array should be completely reversed.So whenever an array has to be reversed, a list of numbers has been given to reverse them, then what to do is exchange the first with the last, exchange the second with the second last, exchange the third with the third last, exchange the fourth with the fourth last, then the first one will go back, the last one will come forward. Now how to do this in the code, now we know that first of all we have to run a loop so that we can go to each element, then we will put a loop, what will that loop do?If we take the example of our array again, it will start from row 1 2 3 4 5 6. If we take the example of this array, then the loop will start from row and how far will the loop go, the loop will go till the half of the array, that is, if it will go till here, then we will exchange this element with this.So the loop will go to half of our size less then n will be divided by 2i and what will happen inside the loop. The values of the array will be exchanged inside the loop. So first of all, what will be the first value? The first value will be the value of our array of i i.e. whatever value is on the rectangle index is our first value and the second value which has to be exchanged is how to find the second value. Second value is for rows.Meaning zero will be the second value for the eighth index. Five will be the second value for the first index. For four second index the second value will be three. So we are able to see that if this value is i then this value is our n i 1. I hope you have understood this thing. Let s make it a table and see what we will do in the table. We will write the value of i. We will write the value of n i 1. Now we know that i is starting from our row.And the value of n is constant. Which is six then the value of i. If it is row then the value of n i 1. We have 5. If there is one then the value of 6 i 1. We have 4 i. If it is 2 then the value of 6 2 1. We have 3. So the pair is formed. The index for row is five. The index for one is the index for two. The index for two is three.If you are not able to think on your own how to find the second value, then it is not a problem because these things come with practice. In this way, you must have reversed an array six times. After that, you will remember that it is reversed from n i 1 because this is the classical way. Whether you are programming in c or in Java, you are doing it in c every time whenever an array is created.If we have to reverse n i 1, we will have to use n i 1, then here we will write second value is array of n i 1, so the first value has arrived, second value has arrived, now process the exchange, how will we do the exchange, we will put the second value in the array of i and the array of n i 1, we will put the first value, so this is our value exchange and here we will end the loop, then finally our array will be inverted. This will be done by creating a new array and let s dry run it. Dry run is done in coding where you analyze the output of the code before running it. Suppose there is an area of size five. Now the first thing we will do is start the loop. How will we start the loop? In the beginning the value of our i is 0 and the value of n i 1 is 4, so this will be the first value, this will be the second value. We will remove the second value in this position i.e. put five.We will remove this and put the first value i.e. one, then i will become plus plus i, here this will become the first value, this will become the second value, after this we will remove this and put the second value, after that we will remove this and put the first value, after that it will be i p i, our i will come. If earlier it was one then this time it will become two. Now we will see that the value of i which is two is less than our 5 2 5 2 integer.If there is 2 then 2 2, whatever is there will be false, so the loop will end here, we will not be able to reach three, so three will remain the same and if we look at the final array, what will come in the final array? First five, then four, then three, then two, then one. This is our reverse. Now let s write the code for this in the code. We have already created an array T 3 4 5. Now what will we do simply, let s create a new function int reverse, inside which we will have one.We will take the array and take the size int reverse int array and the size of the array n Now let s run a loop int aa i will loop from 0 to aa lesson n batu and aa pps and every time what we will do is first of all we will take out the first value first value was array of s and our second value was array of n i 1 it will not be zero it will be array of i Now put in the array of i our second value and array of n Put our first value in i 1, so we have exchanged both these values with each other and this has become our array reverse. Now what will we do, we will get it printed inside the main function, first of all we will call reverse, we will pass the array in it and its size n is the value of n. After that, we will create a function to print our array. A void print array print array for int i 0. We will already write this code.So, I hope that here you will pause the video and this function has to be completed by itself in which we are printing the values of the array A R R of A. Finally, we give a next line, let s do this, we call void here, print the array A R R and F. So first of all reverse the array, call reverse inside the main function, then print the array, save it and run the return of this function.The type is also kept blank because the reverse would not be returning anything, so what is our reverse? 0 4321 Here we made a small mistake when we wrote the second value, we did not write it as n i 1, if we wrote n i i, then we write it as n i 1. If this mistake is not to be made, then there is no one, let s run it again. This time it is printed, our reverse is 5 4 3 2 1.Our array has been reversed. What did we create? 1 2 3 4 5 is printed. 54321 and how to reverse it. Looped through half the array. Interchanged the first value with the second value. Interchangeed the first value with the second. Now one thing we will notice in this is call by value or call by reference. The function that we called is call by reference. Why is one called an array?Whatever the array is, it is our pointer, so the call is made by reference from the pointer itself. Secondly, we saw that when we called reverse, reverse reversed our array, but even inside the main function, the array got reversed, so this shows that whenever we pass the array inside the function, it is always called by reference. So, you will give the array to some other function and then if that function makes some changes in it, then those changes will remain with you.They will also be reflected, that is why the values of the arrays have to be changed very carefully inside any function because they will also be reflected inside the calling function. Now the next question which we will talk about is how to write a program to store the first and fobo numbers. We have already talked about the fobo numbers, so the sequence created is something like this 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 Our 21 And so on nowThe special thing about Fina number is that if Eth number comes If you want to find out, then add n 1 p n 2th number, then first of all we have to create a phone number in which we can store n numbers, then to make it we will take the help of an array. We comment out this entire code. Comment out this too. First of all, make an integer, A. This integer A will tell how many numbers are required, then we ask the user to print A, enter A, scan the value of A, percentage, D andNow what will we do now that we will create an array, let s name this array as Fina and we will give its size equal to n i.e. n numbers will be stored inside this Fina. Now we know that Fina of one row is row and Fina of one is always one. Whenever we enter this n, we will keep in mind the value of n. If the value of n is greater than one or greater than two then Fina row is zero, Fina and one is one.This is always true, we have to always write it down, so we have written them down. Now we have to calculate further FINA, so let s put a loop for that. What we did last time was to calculate FINA from recurt. This time we are doing it with a loop and it is even easier to do it with a loop. How will we run the loop from two and take it till n, so that s done for row and one, now we will start calculating FINA for two and calculate till n 1.So every time fina of aa what will happen fina of aa 1 ps fina of aa 2 I hope you must have understood this line, it is a very important line when we talk about the topic of finaz, what was the n one used to be n 1 p n 2 then what will be the aa i 1 p aa 2 is just a simple concept and then we will get it printed percentage d b t fina of i is printed thenFirst of all when the value of i becomes two then it will be calculated here 1 then the value of 2 will come to us and after that if we calculate for the value of 1 then it will be i then it will be 1 1 then it will come to us 2 after that if we calculate for the value of 4 then it will come to us 2 1 so this value will come to us 3 Now if we calculate for the value of five then it will beThree means this one will be three and two, then its value will come, we will have five and so on. Now let s run it and see that we have to enter 10 FINA numbers, so these 10 FINA numbers have come to us. In this, the first two have not been printed, that is, we have not printed Row and One yet. For that, we can put a separate print statement here. Apart from Row and One, there are remaining eight FINA numbers. First one came, then two came, then three came, then five came.Then came eight, this is our five, then again came sixth, 13, seventh came 21 and eighth, we have 34. So in this way, we can print the extra number of fobo chi numbers for the different difference which is the value of n and I hope that how we did it with recursion and how we did it with it i.e. loop, we must have understood the difference between those two. The next question which we will talk about is create a 2d.Array storing the tables of two and three means we have to store the tables of two and three, so for this we have to create a 2D array. Our array will look something like this in which here we will store the table of two and here we will store the table of three. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 So to store the tables in this way, if we want to see what will be its size, then we need two arrays and the size of both is 10.If we want to store multiplication table up to 10, then we will have to create an array, let s name it tables, an integer 2d array whose name will be tables and its size will be 2 times 10 in which two arrays will be created and the size of each array will be 10, so this is the first array whose size is 10 and the second array whose size is 10. Inside this we will be storing the values in this manner. Let s write the code for this. First of all create an array named tables.Let s take number 10, now let s create a function to store the tables. We will pass the void store table inside it. We will pass D array and its size. First of all A and then A. So here two loops are placed. The first one to put two loops is for int a i 0 a less a a a plus plus.You write A here because A is our row and A is our column. Whatever column we are talking about, the array of n is equal to the number whose table we have to store. The number will be multiplied by a pv, here we add the int number in the declaration, now we will call the store tables inside the main function, inside which we will pass first our array, 2d array, after that we will pass the number of rows, for which row do we want to print it, first of all, zero is for the row and the column in it is 10 and the number is which table is to be printed, let us copy this and again what to do in the first row.We have to print a table of three, here instead of the array, we will pass our 2D array of tables. So first of all, what we did was create a 2D array named tables whose size is 2 10 i.e. there are two arrays inside it and the size of each array is 10. Then we created a function called store table which stores a table of one number. This D array will take which array are we talking about i.e. our row and which column, we mean which one.Are we getting the table of second number printed? Is it on the number of third number or on the fourth number and which number table is to be printed on the table of two? Three has to be printed. Five has to be printed. We have started a loop which will go from row to m. Here the value of m which we are passing is 10. So this is the loop. It will go from row to 10 and after doing all the multiplications it will get the table stored. Which number s number here, we passed two first.After that, first of all two which will be multiplied with i 1 because we have done zero base indexing so the value of i is zero so first of all it will give us the value two then four then six then eight then 10 and so on. So all these values will be stored one by one in the array of tables in our array in which our row will remain constant because we have passed constant n. The column on the row will keep changing so first of all.The value which will be there will be array of 00, then there will be array of 01, then there will be array of 02, then there will be array of 03 and so on, so in this way our value will keep changing in which our zero which is there will remain constant, when we pass zero to n and if n is passed one then we will have one everywhere. I hope this part is clear with us that our n is constant and the value of m will be from zero to 10.The number that will go up to is also a constant. The number has told us whether we want to print a table of two or three. So now we can actually write our tables inside the main function. We copy the same loop once. Here we will write zero print a percentage d b tables of 0 to a. So this one will print a table of two and this loop will print a table of three. Here in place of m we will replaceThis is done with 10 and let s save it and then run it. Here, instead of m, it is going to come every time because m is not our constant, it will keep on changing, the value will come from zero to 10, so it will come here every time. Now here whenever we are looking at this code, we are constantly seeing a red line at the bottom of the array. This is happening because whenever we pass the 2d array, which is the first dimension.Ours is treated like a pointer, but the second dimension is treated like an actual array in which we need to give the size, so like there is a second array, inside it we have to define our size, which is 10, otherwise this red line will never go. From here, if we do not tell the size, then it gives us an error that there are no compatible types. Now if we run this code, the output we get is something in which the table two key is printed first.This is 2 4 6 8 12 till 20 and after that the three key table is being printed. Lad, we should have printed this in the next line, so here we give a statement print f b a. So first of all the two key table has been printed, then the three key table has been printed and how we printed the tables, by storing them inside a 2d array i.e. tables, we called our store table function, calculated the tables and stored them inside it.Printed inside the function and what we got to learn is that whenever we pass a 2D array inside the function, the second dimension has to be always mentioned, so we have read a lot of things about the arrays, we must have given you some questions inside the 2D arrays, we must have given you notes, you can go and see them and I hope that we have a strong grip inside the arrays, that will be coming next increase. We are moving towards our next chapter which is named Structures and Strings. So now we are going to start with our chapter which is named Strings. If we talk about strings then string means a character array terminated by a null character. This is the bar sl 0 that we have shown. This is a null character. Like we write back sl a, it means next line. If we write back sl, it means tab space, then back sl means zero.What we have talked about till now is that we have characters inside C and what a character does is it stores a single letter or a single symbol but suppose we have to store a word, then how should we store the word or how should we store a sentence, there the strings come into our picture.What do strings do? The words in English or the sentences or paragraphs, we can store them in the string data type. Now it will be a normal character array. Suppose we have created a character array named, inside it we will define a few things like A.B.C. These three characters are written inside it. So we will call it a character array on the character array in which if we add a null character in the last, then it will show that it is A.B.C.They are not different, they are joining together to form a word, so this means adding the null character at the end. So what does the string show? The string shows us that it is representing a word. Character Array Now let s look at some of its examples, we have a character array whose name is Name. Now inside the name, we have stored a lot of characters, but at the end, we have also stored null from 0 to 10, so this isIn a way, it represents that the name is not a combination of different characters. The name forms a complete word and the name actually points towards this value. After that, if we look at the class, then the class is not separate. The class forms a complete word by adding all these characters and that word looks like this. Whenever we write strings, we ignore this null character in a way, but at the time of declaring, we use this null character.It is important to show the character because the compiler should know whether it is creating a normal character array or a string of words, then once we declare the string, we see the character name inside our main function and inside this we can write our different characters, H R A D H and A and in the last do not forget to put this null character because if we do not put it then it will be a normal character.Now, what is the difference in taking normal characters like an array? Whenever we talk about strings, there are some special properties associated with the strings and we also get some good functions automatically to run on the strings, but they are not on the normal character array, they are only on the strings, so those special characteristics, those special properties are there to access those special functions.For this, we need to use null character, so here we have initialized a string named name and stored it inside it. There is not a single way to initialize the string with a null character. There are two ways. We have already seen the first method, in which what we are doing is by concatenating different characters and putting a null character at the end of it, but we also initialize the string like a whole word.We have put initialism quotes and inside we have written our complete name. Now here you can ask Didi, the back slash 0 i.e. null character has not come in it, so I would say that if we like this in our string, the C compiler automatically inserts the initialism null character, that is, you will write this much and what will C do? It will automatically insert the back slash zero. Now one more thing to notice here is that whenever you write the character, there are single codes.But we use double codes to write the string, so this distinction should always be remembered if Yes, if we write single quotes then we will be getting error because this method is wrong. Now in this way also we have to create our string as initialism variable. If we want to create the same string then we will create it like this. So we have got a string whose name is name and inside which is stored our actual value and inside it we do not need to enter the zero which is 0, our compiler will automatically put it for us. See another example of this.So like we have created a class variable, we have created a class string inside it, we can put our characters differently or we can put them in the form of same words like character class is equal to our college, then here the space will also come to us automatically, that is, we have given space in between, so this space is automatically coming inside our string and the base 0 which is our null character, our compiler will add it. Next we will talk about that whenever weWhen we define a string, what happens inside the memory, that is, we have defined a normal character array and defined a string. What is the difference between these two? What is the difference in the form of memory? Suppose we have defined a string of ours in this format, then what will happen inside the memory? All the blocks that we have taken as characters will be saved. We will name these blocks as name, whatever is the name of our variable. Now save a single character inside each block.This will happen because the size of each block is one byte, within which we can save a single character. Each block will have its own address and all these addresses will be contiguous, because if the string is a character array inside the memory, then the memory of the character array is continuous, that is, it is continuous, so the memory of the string will also be continuous and inside each memory block, we store an individual character but one.The special thing in this is that a null character is also stored at the end, i.e. if 2006 is the last letter at the memory location, then 2007 will also be a part of our string, inside which we will be storing the base 0, which is our null character, so in this way our string which is stored inside the memory, now let s try a practice question. Our question says that cut a string first name and last.Name i.e. two strings have to be created here, one has to be named first name, one has to be named last name to store the details of the user and print all the characters using a loop, that is, we have to create a string from the first name name, inside which we can store any value, like suppose we have stored Shraddha, then we will create another string from the name last name, we can also store any value inside the last name, suppose we have stored Khap and now we print both these values.We will get it done in the form of a loop. How will we get it printed in the form of a loop? If we keep getting each character printed, then how long will our loop run? The condition inside the loop will come that as long as our character is not equal to the null character, till how long can we repeatedly traverse a string? First of all, until our null character comes, like if we have taken our string as S H R A D H A, then automatically in this, at the last, there will be a back.If there is a slash, then first of all we will come to this character and get it printed, then we will come to this character and get it printed too and in the same way, we will move forward one by one character and will keep getting the characters of our string printed and will do this work until our character becomes a null character i.e. we will create a C pointer or an I and what will this eye object or eye object do, it will traverse it by putting a loop and likeThe value of s becomes back s i.e. null character, similarly the loop will end and we will not get the null character printed and at the end we will have got our entire string printed. Let s visualize it once with the help of the code and let s see how it will happen. First of all, let s create two variables. First our first name will store its value in it. Then we will create our last name. We will also store our value in it. Now what will we do? Let s create a separate function.Void print to print strings Null String Now, how to pass this string to the function, pass it like a normal character array. Here we write the character array and here we do not need to send the size of the line because a special thing about the string is that the string ends where the null character comes. Inside the normal array, we do not know how many elements are there inside the array and till how long it will continue, but inside the string we know that as soon as the null character comes i.e. ourIf the string is over then we will not pass the size here. Let s write this function void print string inside which we will have our string. Now inside our function we will create a loop. We will start the loop with an integer aa which is starting from zero and every time aa will be our plus plus. Now let s postpone this condition for a while and what will we do inside. Every time we are going to print our characters by doing print F. How will we get our characters printed?With the help of array of aa, now we know how to get the value by going to any specific index in the array, we give it by array of aa, that is, we put square brackets, this is our array notation, we can also do it with the help of points, but to me, the array notation for the things with arrays seems more simple. If we compare the edges to points, we will get it done with the help of arrays. Now what is the condition here?The condition has to be kept that whenever the null pointer appears at the index of the array, you stop the execution there, then this loop will run till the null character does not appear at the index of the array, then we write the condition for it, until our array of a is not equal to our null character, then this condition is most important, for how long will our loop run if we want to print all the characters.So until the null character comes on our index, as soon as the null character comes, it means that our string which is there is finished, what will we do at the end, we will get a next line printed because here the characters which are there will be printed one after the other in the same line, after that we are getting a next line printed. Now let s call this function from the main function. First of all, we will call. For the first name, we will pass our first name in the print string, after that we will call ourFor the last name, we will pass our last name in the print string. One thing we must have noticed is that here we have passed only the character array i.e. our string. We did not pass the size of the string because the size is not required. We know that our string will end where the null character will come. If we did not know this in the normal array, then we save it and get it run. So first of all our string first name is printed, after that our string last name is printed, then something like this.From this we can get our string printed character by character. We have to put a loop in it and the special thing that has to be remembered in the loop is that until the null character does not come, the next thing which we will talk about is that our string format has been specified, we have got the string printed in percentage C i.e. character by character and if input has to be taken also, then how will the string take input? We have to take input character by character only, so we do not know anything else but there is a special format in the characters.The specification is percentage s. This format is a specification string in which some value is stored. Now we have to print it. Instead of printing it character by character, a very easy way is to write the percentage s. It means that this format is specified, so all this is done for our print F, but if we want to scan F, then we can do that also automatically with percentage s. For example, suppose we have defined a string in the name of character name.We have given the maximum size of the string from 40. Now if we have to scan it, then scan f percentage s and here we will write name. Why name is written here? Address of name is not written because name is ultimately string. What is character array? What is character array? Array is always a pointer, so the name of the string is a pointer in itself, that is, name is a pointer, so there is no need to write end name here, only name is enough, so in this way. We can also scan f from percentage s and print f. Let s see the example of both. What we will do inside our main function is that we will create a string called character name and give some maximum size of this string, let s say 50. Now first of all we will take this name as input from scanf, then we will output this name from print f. Scan f percentage a and then the name and after that we will print f percentage a. Your name is and here we will write the name, now just this.The entire print string function comes in a single line with the help of print F. When we specify the format with percentage s in it, we save it and run it again. So now first of all we have to enter our name, so we entered the name and now the entire string that has come for us, your name is appended and here is our string. Inside our output, percentage s is to be used always whenever we scan the string. F andWe have to do input and output with the help of print F. Now one special thing in this, you can ask that when we entered the name Shraddha, here when scanf took a name, we did not put ba s 0 in it, then how come back s 0 did it take the string. Now here we can ask one thing that Didi, when we entered our name, we did not put ba s 0 in it, then how did C know that it is a string, so what does C do automatically whenever you put percentage s?Whatever you enter, after that it will automatically insert back 0 i.e. null character. It will seem automatic, so we do not need to take tension. We just have to input our characters. Next thing we will do is solve a practice question. There are two parts in this. From the second part we will be released some new things. So first of all let s start with the first part. Ask the user to enter their first name and print it back to them. This is very much.This is easy, we have already done it. I think, now here we just change the variable a little, name it first name, copy it, then this will also become our first name and this will also become our first name, save it and run it once again. Suppose this time the first name we have entered is Aman, so it gets printed here, your name is Aman. Now the second part is more interesting, it is written in the second part.Try this with your full name. Till now you have entered the first name. Now enter the full name i.e. first name as well as last name. Let s check that part. Comment out this part and create a new string. Character full name of 100 characters. First of all we will scan the full name as percentage. A full name. After that we will print it. Your full name is the percentage of full name. Now let s save it and run it. First of all, let usYou have to enter your full name, but here you will notice one thing that in your full name, only the first name is entered, that is, whatever is after the space, it is not input at all, so here we learn a special property that the scan which is F, cannot input multi word strings, that is, if you put more than one word inside a string, like you put this is a sentence, then it will be able to input only this word as soon as a space comes and the thing after that.If this part is not entered inside our string, then this is the drawback of scan f. Its weakness is that it cannot enter multi word strings which have multiple words because it will not be able to track the spaces. So here we will use two special functions, first of which is get s and then put s. So these come into our picture. Now gate s which is a little depreciated, so instead of this we will use f gates.If we read these three in detail, we have three functions for the string. Whenever we want to input and output the string, percentage s is our format specification. Scanf has a weakness that it cannot access multi words. Suppose our string is a complete sentence or a complete paragraph, then it will never be able to be entered. It will never be able to be entered by the user, so there we use a function which is called gets.What does getus do is take a string as input This means we will define a string character ST whose maximum size we will give is 100. Now if we write that string here, then getus will input our string and what put s will do is put s will output our string i.e. simply we have to write put s SR, this will output our string and if before this we do get s atr, this will input our string but here the get s function is not a dangerous function andIt has an outdated function, due to which many softwares get hacked because Get S does not track what is the maximum size of the ATR, hence, Gets are not used nowadays. In the 11th version of Even C, Gets have been completely removed. There is no use of it, so I had installed the latest C on my system. Now let s try it once and see how our gates and puts will work.We made a name of 100, now what will we do, take its input, first of all we will just write get s and atr, then we will write put s and atr, save it, let us change this name to atr, now run it once, as soon as we run it, a warning came here that this program uses gets which is unsafe, so get s should not be used, but still we put something in our string, hello world, we entered it and we have hello.When the world came back to one, what did Gates do? It took the entire Hello World, that is, it also took the thing after the space. Now what will we do here after entering our full name, we will see how to enter the full name. First of all, we will write our first name, then we will write our last name. I am a good student, in fact, we write the entire line. So now what did the test do, it got the entire line printed with us. In this way, whenever we had to take multi word sentences.If we have to take multi word strings then we will use get s and put s. Now get s because it is dangerous and is a little outdated, so in its place there is another function named F Gets.First of all, we enter our string, whatever string we have to enter, then we put the size of the string, maximum number of characters we can input and after that we put the name of our file, now what is the name of this file, what should be put here, forget it for now and in place of the name of this file, we will put STD I A, just this many lines have to be written, this is called standard input, so what is this, why are we writing this, do not pay attention to it right now, just SDD IWhenever you want to use F get S, put A. What does F get S do? It stops when n 1 characters are input and the new line is edited, that is, you will keep writing your entire word as it is. You will keep writing different words as soon as you press enter or as soon as your n 1 is one less than the size given here. If you enter letters, then your sentence there, your string will end, let us see an example of this here too.Instead of Gets, we do Na F Gets, write ATR, then in ATR we will write 100 and after that we will write STD and save it and run. This time again enter our complete word, it has come back. Now what does this put S do? Push automatically gives a next line. After printing, you have printed whatever you had to print. Now your cursor has come to the next line and since then press return.Once this is done, our programming is over here, so whenever we are putting put ast, we do not need to do back slash and because the next line will come automatically, so in this way our get s, put s and f gates work. The next thing we will learn is a very learned thing. Just as our arrays were points, similarly our strings are also points because there is a very logical answer behind it. If array is a pointer then what is a string also?String is also a character array, so ultimately it is also a pointer. Very easy thing, like what we used to do for our array, we called an int. We made it an array, we can make it like this, we will write the size in it or we can make it like this, similarly, we can make our string with array notation and also with pointer notation, if we have to make the string with pointer notation, then what to do for it, for this we will simply write character pointer and then write atr or whatever we want to name our string and after that our entire string, then it stores the string in the memory and theThe assigned address is stored in the character pointer SDR, so this Hello World, our entire Hello World will be stored inside our memory, at the end of which we will have the number 0 and then its address i.e. the address of the first index, the address of this index will be pointing SDR towards this address, so our string is ultimately a pointer because it is a character array in itself, now the character array andThere is a fundamental difference between pointers. What does that difference say? What does that difference say? If you define a string with the help of a pointer, then you can re initialize the string, that is, you can change the value of that string, like today if we have stored Hello World inside the string, then tomorrow we can store only Hello inside the string and after that by changing its value, we can store only World also, but if we have used array notation.If you use it, it will always be Hello World inside it. Let us define the initialism first. So we will make it a string. So, we will make it as Hello World according to the character pointer. We will put Hello World in it. Now we get it printed, we write here with Can Change and after that, we change this string also. So as soon as we change the string, let s assume that we have made it Hello , after that we push it again, Can Change and save it.Let s run it, so first of all our string was Hello World. What did this line do? It printed Hello World. Then we changed it to Hello, so what did it do? Then it printed Hello because the value of points can change. Now let us create another string. If the character cannot change then we can define it in this way. We will put Hello World in it too. By putting Hello World, we can test it. We can not change it ifIf we want to change the value of Can Not Change yesterday, then hello, now this C compiler will not let us do it and will show a red line because the expression must be a modified force value which is our character array, when the array notation comes then we cannot modify it, that value will remain the same but if you wanted to modify or change then you should have used character pointer, there is a slight difference whenever youWe declare the string with a character pointer or array notation. The next thing we will talk about is that we have to solve question number 49 in this. Make a program that inputs the user s name. Inputs the user s name and prints its length. We have to take a string from the user whose name will be the user s name and then we will input its length. Like for example, we create a string called character name. Suppose the string is 100 in size.First of all, we will take input of string from F gate and write name 100 and after that std in or for simplicity, we will enter only the first name, we will not enter the last name because there is a space in between, so we will not have the hassle of space, we will enter only the first name. Now we have to print its length, so suppose the user has inputted us S H R A D A and the compiler has automatically put back slash 0 behind it, so what should we print?We have to get it printed, we have to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 If we do not count this backs last zero, then the length that should come after getting printed should come to us. If the user has entered aman, in this also back slush zero will come, the length should come to us. What should come to us is the length. We should have four, so the null character should not be counted. We should print the length of our user s name by adding all the other characters.If you want to get it done, let s make a program. First of all, make a string named name, after that do this F gets name 100 std in. Now make a function above. Which will count the length, we will be passing count length in it. It is not necessary that we say our character name or character array. It is not necessary that tomorrow if we have to find out the length of any sentence, then we can use this function for that also, so it is not necessary that we just calculate the length of the name or we can calculate the length of any string or the length of any character, then let s define void effect here.From this our length will be returned, so we write int as int count length character array. Now we have to keep counting the characters for length till our null character comes, so we have already made the loop in this way. When the string was printed character by character, what was done was in a way, we went to every character till the null comes, then here also every character will be counted till the null character comes, then a variable.Let s create a count which will start from zero and then write a loop for int aa 0. As long as our array of aa is not equal to our null character, we will keep doing i as plus plus. So I hope it will be understood that we will start i with zero and will keep increasing aa till the null character comes. Now what will we do every time? If we make the count also plus plus then we will make the count also plus plus every time because.Till the time the null character comes, the count will also be plus plus because we are counting all the characters and at the end we will return our count. Let s call it from our main function. Print F with the percentage D. Length is the count length in which we will pass our name. Let s save and run. First of all, we have to enter our string. After entering the string, we got the length. What did it do to the length? Now count the null character also.How have we counted the null character because the count which is already there is already becoming plus plus, meaning whenever we are sending the count inside this function, the value of count is increasing in the same way as the value of i is increasing. Now the i at the end, which is plus plus, already counts the null character, that is why in the end we need to return count 1, so we will return count 1 only then the correct count will come to us, now the name.Now if we send a different name then length seven is printed. Now if we send a different name then length four is printed. So in this way we can calculate the length of any string we have. We can create a function of our own. We have to go character by character and check things. If suppose inside this string, we have to check that whatever name the user is entering, how many times i comes in it or h comes in it, we also apply character by character loop andLet s check which character is equal to h and then add that count, then in this way a lot of cases can be made. A lot of questions can be made which your interviewer can give you in a different way or the college students can give you in a different way but what is the method? Go character by character. What condition has to be put at the end of the loop until it is equal to the null character. Almost all the 80 questions are solved in the string in the same way in which we have toSome particular thing has to be checked. Next let s talk about standard library functions. Now already we had read about a class named Method A in which we had read a function named pow, which used to do power, it used to return m to the power of n, so in that, this methodIf you want to use a function then it has to be included above. The first function which we will talk about is String Length. Now we have written a big function in which we went to the boxes one by one and calculated the length. This is an already made function. We do not need to create it again. So String Dot Length is a function in which we write our string and it counts and gives us the total number of characters. Now it counts the number of characters.characters but excludes the null character, just like we haven t counted the null character yet This also does not count the null character, so this is an important thing that we have to remember that our string length does not count the null character, it returns the total number of characters and gives us the total number of characters. We count our length once and check it. This time we define the name here itself. In the name, we put Shraddha and this time we will call ATR in place of count length. We include the string length above in our header file include the string D.Let s save it. Here we have called string length in which we have passed our name. Now let s run the code. Actually, this is STRL, it is string length. It returns us unsigned long, meaning it does not return the integer value, it returns unsigned long of length, but we can also type cast it, that is, we will create a variable length and store it in this length. The output of the string length will be an integer.It will be of type and then we get this variable named length printed, compile and run again, so the length of seven has been output to us. Now if we change our string, suppose we write another name here, then what will happen again is our length, that is, the number of characters, all of them will be added, that is, the length will now become four. Now the next library function that we will talk about is our string copy. What does string copy do? It is called ATR.Let s write CPY, two arguments are passed in it, the first argument is our new string, the second argument is our old string, so it copies the value of old string to the new string. Suppose we have created two strings, the first is our character SR1, inside it we have written hello and the second is our character SR2, inside this we have written world. Now this is our new string, this is our old string. If we call SR CPY, first pass our ATR one.And then pass our ATR 2, then the value of our SR and key will change to Hello, that is, the old value will be copied inside it. The value of the second string will be copied inside the first. Let s see how it runs. We will create two strings inside the code. The first will be our old string. We will store the old string in it. Then let us create our new string and store it in it. New string. Now call STTR CPY in which we will first pass our new string andThen the old string and now we will print the value of the new string, we save it and run, so as soon as we got the new string printed, we have the old string printed, the new string is not printed because what the string copy did is that we took the value of the old string and copied it into the new string, then the value of the new string got changed ultimately and now we have that changed value printed, so this is how our string copy works, the next library function which we will talk about.That is String Concatenate here. By the way, we are talking about all the important library functions, so we will discuss only four. However, there are many library functions inside the string D, so the homework for you will be to go and explore all the other library functions on your own. Google translate No Space Yes, if you have left space after Hello, then there will be a space in between, but no space is added on its own. Both the words get stuck completely and a new one is added.Let s create a string, we call it con concatenation, you will hear this word again and again, if you are a programmer or a coder, if you are going to learn new languages after C, then don t forget the word, then string concatenate is a function inside which we will pass the first string and pass the second string and it concatenates the first string with the second string, like if we have created the first string, suppose we have created hello and the second string, we have created world, then if we call this function, then after that first string.The value of the string will change and become equal to Hello World. So in a way, what happened is that String Concatenate took the second string and added it after the first string, then the value of the first string will be equal to this. Now one special thing we need to keep in mind here is that the capacity of the first string should be the To store both the strings, that is, if the size of the first string is equal to the length of the first string, one plus the length of two or is greater than this, then only we will be able to store the value within it, otherwise an error will occur. So, whenever we declare this string as the first string, we will have to increase its size. Once we actually write it in the code, let s comment it out. First of all, let s create a character string, the first string, whose size we give 100.Inside this we are storing hello with a space, then we create another string second string, we do not need to give size in it, we store world in it and now what we will do is ATR CPY in which we will first pass the first string, then we will pass the second string and then we will print our first string to the user, we save and run, then after running, we have only world in the output because we have called STTR CPY whereas we had to net the concat, so ATR CT for concat.Let s call, now we have the complete Hello World printed. How did Hello World come? This Hello was already in the first string, now we have concatenated the world after the first string, appended it, but suppose here we do not write 100, what would have happened if we had written just this much, then once we run the program, we get an error and the program never executes. Because when we declared the first string without a size, it took the size equal to it.In which 1 2 3 4 5 6 So the size of the first string is currently six. We cannot fit the world inside the six, but when we have given the size of the first string as 100, then now it means hello, it is inside it, after that, there is also some free space lying inside it, so inside that we can add the world by bringing it, so whenever we have to create a problem, we have to ensure that we have some free space inside the first string, inside which the second string can come and join. Next LibraryThe function we will talk about is ATR CMP. Here by mistake CPM is written. This is CM. This is for string comparison. So we can also compare the strings whether one string is equal or not equal to the other string. In fact we can also compare whether one string is smaller or bigger than the other string. How will we compare? We pass two strings inside ATR CMP, a first string and a second string. Now this is the function.It returns an integer, if it returned zero, it means both our strings are equal, so like if we passed hello and also passed hello in the second string, then it means that this is our function will return us, we have zero. Now if it returned any positive value, it means the first string is greater than the second string and it will depend on one of the values. Its example is in the first string we passed banana, in the second string we passed apple, so this one.Now Banana and Apple will return positive values. Whenever we see Esc values, a comes first, then b, then CD. In this way, the S values keep increasing. So in Banana, which is an S value, first of all, the value of b will be compared with a. If both of them were HH, then the value of both would have been the same, then the next character would have been compared, but that is not the case, here only the first character is different.So the value of b will be something in numbers. The value of a will be something in numbers. If we calculate the difference between these two, then the Esc character of b is bigger, that of A is smaller, then Esc characters will be minus, like if we look at one character of b, character b b, then the character of b is 66, so here 66 will come, so a should be 65, so what is happening internally, it will be 66 65, which meansDifference will come 1, that is why a positive value will be printed, that is, we will subtract the Esc of the second string from the Esc of the first string. Whenever our letters are different, that is why whenever the first string is bigger, if the second string is smaller, then a positive value will be printed and vice versa, i.e. if the first string is smaller, if the second string is bigger, then we will have a negative value printed. Let us see an example of this.are as if Lee is string, we have L and second string, we have banana, so in first a will be equal to 65, b will be equal to 66, so 65 66 will give us negative 1, so since this is a negative value, then we will know from string comparison that our first string is shorter than our second string. Make sure to verify all these once with code key, then we learn any concept in programming.Always verifying should not happen that we have just read the theory theory and we have not tried its code. So first of all we create a character string, the first string inside which we store L, then we create the second string inside which we store it and now we print the percentage D because it will be printed as an integer. For comparison, we will print ST R C M P in which we will first pass the first string and then we will pass the second string. Save and run. So it is printed as 1, which was expected because aWhich is 65, unit of b is 66, then 65 66 will be a negative value which will show that the first string is smaller than our second string. Now if we change these values i.e. first pass our second string and then pass our first string then what will be the output in that case. In that case the output will be a positive value i.e. 1 1. This is because b a is here now and by doing one more small thing.Let s see, this time we change the string to h A A A and here we change the string to h H A B Here again we pass the first string and here we pass our second string Save and Run Now if you want to discuss with yourself before running, what will be the output, then inside the first string is H H H A, in the second string is H H H B. The different character inside both of them is which is the first, that is a and b. So again the esca of a will be minus the esca of b, then that of a.Escay is 65 Escay of b is 66, so this will also return a negative value to us, let us verify it, it will be printed and will come 1 and here if we remove a and b and now compare both of them, then now we are going to get zero because both the strings are the same, so if we want to compare the strings, then we can do that. This is a string comparison function. If we look at real life cases, then where can it be used?This can be used if we create a function that is forming our dictionary. What happens inside the dictionary? The letters come first in the alphabet, which means they have less values, so they come first inside our dictionary and the rest come after us. So, we can sort them according to the negative value, which has the least negative value, meaning the more negative it is, the sooner it will come inside the dictionary, the more positive it is.That much will come inside the dictionary later, so in this way, whenever you have to compare the characters, which character is smaller at the beginning of the dictionary, the bigger one is at the end of the dictionary. We will talk about it next. Our question is that take a string input from the user using characters, meaning till now, how were we taking input of the string, either we were taking input in the form of percentage s or doing F get S or get S. Now what we have to do is percentage.C means it has to take input character by character. For this, we create a function. We name the function. Instead of creating the input string or in fact function, we create the entire program. Inside our main function, first define a string ATR which can hold 100 characters. Then we will define the character and this is the character which we have to input again and again from the user. We will input this character set and keep adding it inside the string one by one, then a loop will run.What happens whenever we input any string from our console window, we enter a character, enter a third character, enter a fourth, enter a fifth, finally hit enter, we have to keep inputting the characters in our loop inside our code until we enter the character of the next line, that is why we make the same condition until our character isNot equal to bad That is, next line, until we press enter, what will we do? We will scan F, we will do percentage C, our C, let s take another variable i which will track our index, so we will initialize i with row. Here we will take characters one by one and store them inside our string one by one, then AT of i S, then we will do i Now let us understand this loop a little more deeply. First of all, we created a string, after that we created characters.Our goal is to take characters from the user one by one and add them inside the string and how will we track the index of the string. Now with the help of our variable, we will create a loop. We are creating a while loop. The condition inside it is that till our user does not press enter, put all the characters given by us in the string. So, we will keep taking input from the scanner one by one. After that, what will we do, we will add them inside the string and the index of the string.We will increase it by one, let s save it and now what will we do with it finally, we will have to put the null character inside the ATR of aa manually because the null character will not be inserted automatically compiled now because the null character is not automatically inserted in the percentage c, if the percentage is put in s then we will have to insert the null character separately to show that it is a string, after that we will print our entire string. From put s, ATR will save it.And now run is giving us this warning because here we had to enter the address of CA. Now we can enter any string of ours. Suppose we have entered Hello World, for us it is Hello World, after getting printed and coming back, it has also counted the spaces in it. So this is the function which we have created by ourselves. This part acts like our gates or acts like our F gates, it will take the entire sentence as long as our size isWe are putting less than 100 in it, whether you put space, put special character in it, put letter in upper case, put letter in smaller case, put numbers, everything will take input but as soon as you press enter, it will stop taking input and it will append null character in our string. The next question which we will talk about is a special one. This question has been created by myself. There is a concept called salting. Whenever we do hacking, neither our password nor our password is secure.In companies, how are passwords secured? The technique by which they are secured is first saltis. Suppose you have set a password. The password is yours. Test 1 2 3 This is your password and the company has a string. The string is the ABC of the company. So saltis is that the company will take your password and add its own salt inside it. Just like we sprinkle salt inside a vegetable, similarly whenever a company saves the password, there is no salt inside it.If she sprinkles her salt, she can put her salt anywhere in the middle at random and then 1 2 3, then when your password is saved, it will be saved in this format in which there is a salt in the middle, then if the hacker will hack it, then he will not know what the salt of the company was, he will think that the entire password is yours, so he will never be able to enter inside your account. Even if the company s system is hacked, then what is the salt?What happens is that our salt is a string which we put inside the normal password and put it randomly somewhere, that company decides, like I have to put it on instagram2 tomorrow, google3, which I have to put on my index zero and index five index inside the password, then the salt of the company can be anything, the position at which it will be put inside your password can also be anything, our saltis remains this, now the question is our saltis, the question says that to the user.Get a password entered, the user has entered his password and inside it is our salt. Add it at the end i.e. we will enter the password from the user and at the end we will add the salt tooth and after that the new password has to be printed back to the user, then how will we get it done. Suppose the user has entered his password, his test and salt is our T3, so now we have to give a new password, the new password should have its value, we will give the test and salt at the end.If we add that means tooth then this is our new Password will be created for which we have to give it back to the user, so we will write a program for it. We are going to create a function. What will this function do? It will take our string and then create a new string. New password in which it will copy the old string plus add our tooth behind it. So inside the main function first of all we create a character string. The password can be of 100 characters. Maximum, we will take input of this password from the user i.e. Scan F Percentage S. Our password is now inside this password.We are going to make sure that there are no spaces, so we can use percentage S and then we will call a function saltis, let us also create a function, this function will return nothing, it will just print the new password and give it to you, then its return type is void, salt, inside this we will get the character password. Let us create this function, void sorting character password. First of all, we define our string which we have to add, so our character is salt to 3, now one.Create a new character in the new password and double its size. So, first of all we have to copy our password inside the new password. Then if we want to copy our salt, then first of all we use the string copy function. STTR CPY. What will we pass as the first string in the string copy? First string will we pass our new password and the second string will be our password. So what will ATR CPY do? It will copy the value of our password by putting it inside the new password and after that we will call STTR CT. Now we will connect.That is, inside the new password, we want to concatenate our salt. What did it do? We put the old password in the new password. What did the test and concatenate do? It made the value of the new password test plus 123, so this test will become 123. Now we will get this printed. The new password is a small function for the saltini and you are able to write this very complex function yourself, which means you have a good level of logic.Things are coming and programming is coming, so inside this function we have used two library functions, one for copying the string and one for concatenating the string. So much of our work became easy and within two lines we simply did it. So this is the power of our library functions. So finally we will get our new password printed. What will we do inside the main function? Let s call this function and pass the sorting in which we will pass our password. We will do this.Save it and run it, enter your password, test it, we have a new password, the test tooth is printed, run it once again, so this time suppose we have entered the password of our college, this time our college tooth is printed, so in this way, by using many library functions, we can create many interesting functions, we can do many interesting things and the code will become very easy because you are getting the entire function in a single line, so our question is something like this.That is, write a function name slice which takes a string and returns a slice string from index n to n. Let us understand this with an example. Slice is a function. Its work is to take a string. Suppose we have taken a string. Hello World and inside it we will be given two indices, one will be n, one will be indexed. The value of our n is given to us 3. The value of m is given 6, so we have to return a string which will start from n 3. 6, that is, if we talk about this string, its index is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and neither. Our slice function will take the string as input and will give us the output from three to six, i.e. from A to O. L O W O. So, Hello World, the string was H E L L R L D. This AOD part will be returned to us from inside it because it starts from n 3 index and ends at m 6 index.So the work of slice is to slice this string from here. Slice i.e. cut the first slice that comes. The first cut will be made at n 3, the second cut will be made at m 6 and the middle part will be returned to us. So let s create a function for this too. Let s name the function. What will this function do? Will it return to us? Will it get its slice? RT, so let s name it Void Slice. Inside this we will pass our character. We will also define this function. Void Slice will pass character SR in it. Along with this, there will also be an index n and an index m, so let s write them as int n int m. Now let s create a new string inside the slice function, carry new a. Well, we know the size of this string as m n 1, but by default we keep its size as 100. Now let s run a loop.Where will the loop start? The loop will start from i n and our loop will go until our i is equal to m and here we are assuming that no one will do any mischief while calling the slice i.e. n and m which are n and m are valid values. It is not like that a, so g has given the value after the null character, n has been given a negative f. It is not like that, only valid values have to be given which if it comes somewhere in the middle of the string then from n.Here our loop will go till m and what will we do inside the new string, let s create one for the new string also, starting from j 0 and j will be our bar plus this j which is the index of our new string, new string of j is equal to at of aa. I hope this thing will be clear that j is the index inside the new string and i is the index inside the string. Let us see this in the form of an example to see what we want to do. Here we have passed a string atr whichSuppose inside we have given Hello World and now we have created a new SDR, the new SDR is empty now, that means a lot of space in it will be empty, here we have passed n 3 and m 6, so this loop is 0 1 2 3, our loop will be starting from this l and for new s, it will be starting from j 0, here it will be starting from i 3, so first of all we will copy this l here i.e. bring it here and copy it.Bring this here, bring this here and bring this here, our loop will run in this manner, so first of all we will copy for i 3 and bring l here, then it will become j and i will become 4, then we will copy o also, then j will become two, then we will copy w, then j will become 3. By then, i will also become our six, so we will copy this o here, so as soon as i6 happens, our slice is finished and the final string which we will return will be in that.Aod inside our new string, one by one the value of j is increasing from row and the value of i is increasing from n and will go till m, so let us try to achieve this thing from this line and and in the last, what will we do in the new attr, we will append j, here we will append it here ba s 0, now we need this j here, so we declare j outside int j 0, so hereYou will not have to initialize it, let s save it. Now by putting S in the last, we will also print our new string. Inside the main function, we will create our character SDR, inside which we will write Hello World. Now we will call the slice, we will pass our string in it along with n 3 m 6. Let us save it and run. So there is a space here because in Hello World, we have given a space without any space. If we try again with Hello World, then this isOur string from index 3 to index 6 got cut and came back to us after getting sliced, we got it printed, so we have created a slice function and all the questions we are practicing, more than this, our logical thinking is getting built up, that is, C programming programming is not about syntax, we have learned how to declare a string like this or we have learned how to declare an integer like this.This is how we print it. Programming is about the logic. Whatever language you use, the logic remains the same. Now you can write this slice function in C P, you can also write it in Java, you can also write it in JavaScript, you can write it in C, in Go, in Python, in whatever language you want. The logic will remain the same, you will have to put a for loop, inside it you will have to copy things like this and then you can get it printed.Or we can get it returned. The logic will remain the same. Our programming language may change. The next question we will talk about is to write a function to count the occurrences of vowels in a string i.e. how many times the vowels are there. Others are adding that in a string, we have to count, as if we are given a string, how many times do vowels occur in Hello World, Hello World? One, Two, Three. Now, for those students who do not know what vowels are, there are vowels in our letters A, E, I, O and U. There are five vowels in the English language. If any of these five appears, then we will count plus plus. We have already discussed how to do this for loop.How to apply it and for how long, till the null character appears and we will analyze the characters one by one. If the verbal character appears then do plus plus. If it does not appear then leave it and move ahead. This is going to be a simple method. Let s create a function for this also. We have created many functions. Inside this code, do not get confused that we are talking about the latest function which we are discussing. In fact, what do I do? Rest of the gist of the code is not there.I comment it out for simplicity so that we know what we are talking about. I also comment it out int count wobbles. Inside this we will be passing our string int count vals character SR. Inside this we will have string. Let s take a variable count which will start from row. Now let s run a loop in which int will initialize with i until our string of i is not equal to null.character and now let s do i p then we will compare every time i.e. we will write the condition if at of i is equal to equal to another and or string of i is equal to our e, after that we will write string of i is equal to equal to a and and string of a is equal to o equal to o and and string of a is equal to equal to y So have we checked whether our rectangle is index p which is the string of ourThere is a character inside the string, whether it is A or E or I or O or U, that is, if there are any of the vowels, then at that time we will do count plus plus and what to do at the end, we will return the count. So inside the main function, we call up for this string of ours. We will pass the count vowels in count vowels. We will pass our string and whatever is returned, we get it printed. Percentage D Vowels R. So we have written the line to print the vowels.For this, let s save and run, there are three vowels inside Hello World, E is the second, O is the second, O is the third, this is the second, apart from this, if we write any word here, let s say Shraddha, then we save it and run, so there are two vowels inside it, that is, two edges come, so in this way, you can count the vowels inside your different words, if we subtract this number with the total length, that means as many.Vowels have come to us, take out the total length from STRLN and count minus the count of vowels, then we can count the total consonants, that is, we can count the letters which are not Vavlu, or we have to count how many times it comes with this word, how many times it comes in this word, if h comes twice, then here the condition of if will be changed, we will compare it with h and count them.Take or how many times D comes or how many times A comes, then we can create different types of functions according to different conditions. The next question which we will talk about is check if a given character is present in a string and not like we have been given a string, Hello World, now we have been given a character along with the character C which is D, we have to check whether this character is present inside this string or not, yes and no, if D is present inside it then print.It will be yes, if character S is ours, suppose A is capital A then capital A is not present, small L is present then in that case we print no or if character S is ours x thenIs equal next one i 1? Is equal as soon as it becomes equal? Print S, otherwise print no at the end. If we work with simple logic, let s make a function, comment it out, make a function, int check, infact let s void check carry. We will pass the character in this, first of all we will pass our string and also a character see void check character in which we will pass the string and our character C. Now how will we check the character, we will put a loop for int aa equals 0 aa till or atr of aa till not equal to our null character aa will keep on happening plus plus if our atr of aa becomes equal to seech then in that case we have to print it, the character is present and print.Get it returned from here itself, that is, end the function right here. The function will end as soon as we get the character, so there will be no hassle. If we get the character, get it returned in the same way and after that, what will happen. All the further checks to be done will not happen because the character has been found here and if it is not found, then nothing has to be done. All the checks have to be done and if the loop is over and the return has not been made yet, then at the end we will have to print thatIf the character is not present then we will print it here. Then we will be returning it from here. We are checking the character one by one whether it is equal to the string or not. After that, if any character of the string is found anywhere then we will print it is present and will get it returned from there. If it is not found then we have to write at the end that the character is not present. Let us save and run this in the main function.Inside also, let s create a string of our character. Suppose we have created a string, our college character seach which we want to send is E in the beginning and we will call check character F R E here on C. Now if we save it and run it then it is written character is present but here if we had replaced e withWhat remains is the logic? We will traverse the string one by one. We will keep removing the characters and keep checking our conditions. So I hope that we got to learn a lot about the string. There are some additional questions inside the class that we can solve. The next chapter we will talk about is going to be our Structures which is a really important chapter whenever we talk about C programming because structures are there right.Let s form the basis. After reading the structures of c p, we will start understanding some of the things that exist inside c p. So now we are going to start our chapter nine, whose name is Structures. Now before this we have seen many collection data types like we have seen a collection of integers, an integer array, a collection of characters, a string. In the same way, if we want to create a collection which has many different types of data.Let s say we have to store an int, we have to store a character, we have to store a float and also we have to store a string. Now we cannot form an array by combining these four because what is an array? Array is a collection of data whose data type is the same but here we have to create such a collection in which our data types are different. To form such collections, we use structures. If we look at the definition of structures then structure isA collection of values of different data types i.e. you will take different data types and then if you want to keep them within a collection within a structure, then we will call it a structure. What can be an example of a structure, for example, if we have to store the information of a student, then to store that information, first of all we will have to store his name which will be of a string type and we will not have to store his roll number which will be of an integer type.And its CGPA will have to be stored for which we can take a floating value, so when we have to store any information in this way, then we do it with the help of structures. Now what will be the syntax to create a structure? In the syntax of creating a structure, first of all we write the structure keyword. The structure keyword tells us that we are going to create a structure, after that we write the name of the structure, like if we want to store the information of the student, then in it weStore different values If we were storing the information of an employee, we would have named it Student. Suppose, if you were storing the information of an employee, then we would have named it Employee. If we were storing the information of a bank account holder, then we would have given it the name Bank Account in which we would have been storing the account number, IFSC code, bank name, bank address, all these things. So here we have named our structure Student and inside it we have stored three values.The first one is the character array i.e. our string name, after that we have an integer variable named roll number, then a float variable which we named CGPA and we write this entire structure inside the parentheses, meaning all the elements that are going to come inside the structure, we write them inside the parentheses and at the end we put a statement terminator. Usually we forget to include children due to which an error occurs, so we should not forget the statement terminator.Now let us discuss once that data types are of two types, one is our inbuilt data types which already exist within our programming language like we have integers, our floats or our characters or in fact arrays also come under this category. Now on the other side we come to the user defined data types. User defined data types are created by the user till now if we wanted an integer then it was.Already exists in the memory, that integer character means that four bytes have been saved for you in the memory. If a character was required, then it was also already existed. C programming tells that if the character already exists, then you need one byte. If you want to store any character, any letter or special character, then already exists in C programming. But suppose if we want such a data type in which for float inside we need four bytes of integer character.For example, four bytes are required and if we want to store characters in it, then the user will have to create such a custom data type himself, it is not already available in C. Now such data types are called user defined and our structure comes in the category of user defined data type, that is, the user can define it himself. So, like we have an integer array. What is an integer array? Suppose we have created an integer array A RR whose size we have given.Three, now what will happen in this, memory equal to one or three integers will be saved for us in the memory of the computer. Similarly, whenever we create a student, as soon as the student is created, we have memory equal to one string, memory equal to one integer and memory equal to one float is reserved. So now we have a new data type in which we can store three different values together and how to create it. So, we have defined our data type as follows.Once we have to write that our data type will look something like this, after that if we have to use the data type then just like we used to use integer int n 5, in the same way here we have to write structure student, this is our data type student structure, after that in place of n we have s1 and now if we have to access different different parameters for s1 i.e. for student, like for name we will write s1, for name roll number we will write s1.For roll number and CGPA, we will write s1 cp7 5, so in this way we will be declaring it, using it and then also accessing the parameters inside it. Now let s actually create a structure inside the code and see how it is written. First of all we will write struct keyword struct, after that we will write student as the name of our structure. Now inside this we are going to define three things, roll number CGPA and name, first of allWe write int role after that float CGPA end after that character name of 100 characters and at the end we will put statement terminator so this is our data type defined structure is our user defined data type now inside the main function we will create a variable of structure type structure student our type and after that the name of the variable is s1 which we have not initialized yet but have just declared it as initialism and this is itsproperty Yes, now if we want to access the roll property of s1, then we will put dot operator in the middle i.e. s1 and roll number, we will make it equal to 2, then after our value we will write s1, we add some value in this also, then now we have to write s1.n If we start writing it normally like we simply wrote s1.n Shraddha So this is the syntax for declaring your string and passing it on as s1.Why is it wrong because inside the strings we had already read that you cannot change the values of the strings which are defined by array notation, you can copy the values in it, you can compare that string, you can use the functions of inbuilt string but you cannot change its value directly from is equal to. Yes, if it was a character pointer then that thing was possible but here this array.It is defined from the notation, that is why here we have to use our string function string copy, for that we include the library above as string da and what we do below is let us do common doubt and write s pva, whom do we want to copy to whom, we will change our name as s1.If you want to copy in the name, then first you will write s1, name will be the second string, our, now, this second string will be copied inside our first string and after this, what will we do, we are going to display all the three properties, first of all we write student name is equal to percentage s s1.n Now even when the value had to be assigned to s1 .And even when we have to print the value, we have to name it as s1. If we directly think that we will simply write s1 here and will not use dot, that is, along with this, we will print only the value of s1, after that we are going to print the roll number of our student, percentage D to s1 dot roll end and after that we will print the CGPA percentage of our student as f s1 sj p and at the end of all we will put back sl n. Do this.Let s save it and run it, first of all we have the name of the student, after that we have the roll number and after that we have the CGPA of the student, so in this way we declare our structure, first of all we create a variable for it, then assign value to the parameters in the variable, then we can use that value anywhere, that is, we can print that value.You can also change that value and assign it to any other value. The next thing we will read inside this is that when we declare the structure, what actually happens inside the memory. We had read that when we declare an integer array, then three continuous locations are stored inside the memory, like if we created an array of integer type, then 1 2 3, these three are our memory.Key locations are saved. Similarly, when we create a structure, whatever data types we define inside it, according to those data types, there are some areas inside our memory which get stored, that too in contiguous fashion, i.e. continuously, just as there are blocks one after the other inside the array, similarly here too there are contiguous memory locations, like if we created a student structure in which first of all we kept a character array for a string, then first of all it is equal to a string.The memory location will be stored with us to which we will give a name. Now inside the name, all the characters that we want to store in our name string will be stored. Now here the size that we have given to the name is equal to 100 characters, so the next integer will be allocated after 100 characters, so 21 will come, after that 2110 will come, then the roll number will get space, if the roll number is of integer type.It will get the space of four bytes. Now after four bytes, 2114 will come where CGPA. CGPA is of our float type, so it will be getting the same amount of memory, so in this way, in contiguous fashion, i.e. in continuous fashion, we have memory locations stored one after the other. Whenever we create a structure, obviously, this format may change slightly according to some compilers and some according to the machines.If someone asks, then by default this is what we assume. Next is a practice question. Let s not do it. The practice question says, write a program to store the data of three students. We have to write a program and we have to store the data of three students in it. So for that, we have already created a structure, that is, we have created our student structure. We have also created the information of one student. Now what will we do? If we create another student, we will copy all the information to create it.You can do this First of all, we will write s2 here, now we will write the roll number of s2 as 1660 88.7 Here we change the name and make it everywhere s2, now by copying it similarly, we will create another student, we will name it s3, inside s3 also we will be changing the values, above, let us change s2 here also, s2 or here, our s3 and s3 are done, so the initial ones.There are questions in it, I want that instead of copying, if you are writing this syntax yourself for the first time, then you have to write it by typing, not copying. In the beginning, if all three students learn a new thing, then do it in a very basic way instead of copy pasting, so it will be remembered for a longer time. So in this way, if you make three students, then how to use our structure, how to access its values, how to declare it.We will remember it, so if you are learning the structure yourself for the first time and are questioning yourself, then you have to write it basic, that is, do not copy the values of all three students. Now it has become S3 in all three. Here we change the roll numbers and our CGPA. We save and run it. So first of all we got the values of the first student, after that the values of the second student came and after that that of the third student.Now the values have arrived, we can change its formatting as per whatever we want to display. Now here many interesting problems can be solved by using Pe Na Structures, like suppose you are making a system for your school or a system for a college which stores all the information of the students or you want to calculate the entire percentage in which the semester wise marks of each subject is stored, now such data isTo store the marks, they are of the same type, but students have many different types of data. If you want to create a system to store it, then you will have to use structures in C, in which you can store many different types of information and can create your own project which handles the data of the students of your college. Talking about the next topic, the next topic is Benefits of Structure.We have seen that yes, it is okay, we store different types of data, but actually there are some limitations. If a question comes in your paper or interview, ask what are the benefits of structures, like the benefit of array. We had understood that what was the benefit of array, that to store the same type of data, first of all, you do not have to create different variables. Suppose you have to store 100 integers, then you have to create 100 different variables.There is no need to remember, we have to create a single array and we have to remember each variable integer, we will access all the rest from it and all the activities like even sorting are done on it, like sorting in increasing order, sorting in decreasing order and when we do different complexity algorithms, they are solved by using many arrays, then there we get the benefit of arrays, similarly we use structures.One can ask the benefit, the first benefit of the structure is that it saves us from creating many variables like arrays, now here if we do not create the structure for the student then first of all we would write this s2 roll number, write this s2 roll number, write this s3 roll number on s3 CG, then there would be so many different variables which we would have to declare, then we would not have to declare many variables because structures.The second benefit has come into the picture, this is good data management and organization. Now we know that for every student, name has to be stored, CGPA has to be stored, roll number has to be stored. It is possible that instead of CGPA, percentage can be stored somewhere. Name of parents can be stored for every student. Their Aadhar ID can be stored for every student, which means all the information will be common, so instead of creating same type of variables again and again, it is better to do good management. Data management is also a very important core concept. When we do programming, then how to manage the data in a good way. If there is same type of information thenFor that, create the same data type which we create with the help of structure, hence all the data comes to us in structured format. Next if we talk about it, we will read next about array of structures. Now we had read that we can create an array of integers, like if we want to store the roll numbers of students, then for 100 students, we have created an array of students roll numbers. Similarly, if we want to store the price in float, thenNext we will write float then price and then price of 100 items, so here first we write the data type, then the name of the variable and then the quantity, first the data type, then the name of the variable, then the quantity. The same happens in structures too, we can make similar arrays of structures, first the data type i.e. our structure student, then the name of the variable and then quantity, first the data type, then the name of the variable, then the quantity. So here we have the array of structures.If you want to understand what has been declared, then first of all we have told the data type that the structure is Student, the data type of all three arrays is then we have taken EC, here we will store the information of 100 children of Electronics. Inside the structure, we have given the number 100, then we will store the information of 100 children of COE, then we will store the information of 100 children of IT, so these are three different arrays, now Student.We have already created the student structure when we used to do Agist. Now here we want that there should be separate information stores for the 100 students of EC, the 100 students of COE, Computer Science and the 100 students of IT. So now you will create different arrays for them and how to access them, we will access in this format that first we have to write the name of the array, then we have to write the index and then dot roll number. So what will happen with this is that we have stored our data inside the memory.100 structures have been created in this, this is our row student of EEC, this is the first student of EC, this is the second student of EC and so on, inside this student he has his own name, one roll number and one CGPA student also has his own name, one roll number and one CGPA and same three information for this student. Every student has his own individual information and if we consider this information asEC 0 A of the student, if we want to access the roll number of the student, then what will we write? EC of 0 dat roll number. Now, if we want to assign a roll number to it, let us assume that by assigning 1664, then that assignment is possible in this way. So, first of all, we will write the name of our array, then we will write the index, after that by putting a dot, we will write the name of our property which we want to access, similarly I0 roll number and I0 CGPA.Now let s actually create an array of students and remove the old code, then we have already created Structure Student. Here we write Structure Student. Now we are going to give the name of the array as EC. We have 100 children inside EC, so if we have to store the roll number of the second child of EC, then we will write it as 1664. If we have to store the CGPA of this child of EC, then we will write it as CGPA.99.2 And if we want to store the name of this child, then again we will write ATR CPY first, 0 name and then we will write our name. Now we can print this information also, first we will write name percentage S in the form of print F. Now we only print the name. If you are writing the code for the first time, then you have to print all three. Dot name and run it once. So the name has been printed here. Is the syntax coming normal?First you have to write the data type, then you have to write the name of the variable, then the name of the array and then the size of the array and you have to access the values in it only with the same indexed format. Whenever you are assigning values or printing values or using them. Next let s talk about the initialization of structures. What we did is, we declared a structure and then made it a variable. Then we assign the properties of the variable one by one. But instead of using the dot operator again and again, we can assign all the properties together. This is called initializing structures. So in what format do we initialize the structures? First of all, we will write the name of our structure i.e. data type, then the name of our variable and the right side.We will write all our three values inside , like if we want to write name, then name is written first, then roll number, then our CGPA. If we talk about student s2, then for that also we have written name first, then roll number, then CGPA. Now if we write row inside the parentheses on the right side, it means that all the three values for s3 will be null values, meaning zero will go to all automatically, so here we are declaring but automatically.Zero will be assigned to them, then the advantage of initializing it in a single line is that you do not have to write four different lines. First, what do you do, declare s1, then make s1 roll number, then make s1 CGPA, but now we are able to do all these things in a single line.I am going in the format in which I have defined the parameters inside the structure and I suggest that whenever you declare things, you should always go in the same order so that if a new person comes and is reading your code or any other programmer then this is a very good programming habit that assign values to them in the order in which you declare things so that it looks systematic. Yes, if the roll number is written first then it will be his roll number.After that, if we want to write CGPA, then we write our CGPA and after that we write the name and save it. Now we will be able to access the values like before, like if I want to print F, student s roll number from percentage D, then here we can write s1 dot roll number, save it and run it. So what is happening is that it is running normally, that is, like before, inside the single line, we have created the variable of our structure and thenWe assigned the values inside and after that we used those values in the next line. In the same way, if you already know all the values for a structure, then it is best to assign it in one go. Next let s talk about points to structures, like our points are to arrays, points are to strings, points are to characters, we can create a pointer for each variable.Similarly, we can create a pointer for a structure also because ultimately structure is also a data type. If we have declared a variable of structure type s1 then how will we declare the pointer for it. To declare the pointer, first of all we have to write the type like we write int star ptr and above we wrote int a and then we write ptr m but a the same format will remain only here pe instead of int.Structure Student will come, then inside our star PTR and PTR, we will assign it on m i.e. the address of s1, so all the format has to be kept the same, just int float care in the data type, in its place we have to keep the data type Structure Student so that we can tell that this is a pointer to the structure, let s check this also once, we have created a pointer to the student s1 above, we will create a pointer for it, Structure Student Star PTR and this PTR.Inside we assign the address of s1. Now if we want to print this same roll number then how will we get the same roll number printed? First we had written s1 roll. Now if we want to print it with the help of pointer then what will the star pointer give us? Here the star pointer gives us the value of the pointer like if I have written the star pointer here, asteris pointer or value at address of pointer then this is whatThe value is this is the value of the entire s1, that is, right now I am pointing towards it but I specifically want only the roll number, so with the star pointer I have got the entire s1, now I will put the dot roll in front of it and get its roll number, I hope. This thing will be clear to us that with the star pointer we are getting the points paid on the entire s1 and when we are rolling the dot, we are getting the entire roll number, so this is our entire variable and this is just a way to display a single parameter. Now let s save it and run it. So the first time the roll number was printed for us, the second time also the same value of the student was printed for us but this time we got it printed with the help of points.Let me make a small change and try this, if you are writing the code by looking at my screen, then it is possible that many of you students may make this mistake. What mistake do we make? We put this parenthesis here after the star, that is, in some way, we do the thing that the parenthesis has come here and here it has come here. What does this give us? It gives us an error because the star has to be always kept with the pointer because now what is happening is this pointer.Dot is taking the roll and after that we are applying star operator in it but first we have to apply star operator with the pointer and then we have to take the dot roll number of it, so always remember this format that whenever there is a star pointer, for structures it means a pointer which is pointing towards the structure, then it has to be put in parentheses first and then we have to use dot operator. Next let s see one of our arrow operators. The structures that we have talked about till now are structures.What do we do inside s1 roll number or s1 name and if we have to write the same format in the pointer then we will write star ptr dot roll number or star ptr name but if we follow this pointer format then it gets too complicated then instead of this dot format we can use arrow operator i.e. if we have written star ptr dot code somewhere then we can change it to ptr arrow code thisHow to write arrow The operator of higher fun and greater than will appear on your screen, so it forms an arrow in itself, so whenever you write this arrow in the middle, you convert this syntax into this syntax and the syntax with arrow operator is very easy, like if you are using it in points, then sometimes people get confused after seeing the asteris as to which star is associated with which value.We are talking but from here we are able to see very clearly that if you bring me the code of the value the pointer is pointing to, then with whom to assign the star, where to put the pencils, our problem gets solved and simply we are able to put only one arrow, let s try this also, what we did now was get the pointer dot roll printed, copy the same line and paste it, this is ourStudent Dot Roll with Pointer Now we will get Student Arrow Roll printed. To get this done, we will write PTR arrow here i.e. sign of smaller and greater than and after that we will write the roll number, then we save it and run. If we did dot roll number, then the same value is printed. Same with the points and when we used the arrow operator, we have got the same value printed. Our name and our CG are also printed with this arrow operator.We are going to get it done so that whatever is there gets settled in the mind properly, here we will write name name percentage S and here we will write our CGPA. So now we have roll number, name is also here, our CGP is also here, so whenever you are using points, the suggestion for you is that for the sake of simplicity, in the code, it should be easy for the reader, it should be easy for you too, so next time you are reading, use the arrow operator, otherwise you can use the normal agar structure.If you are creating a variable, then dot operator is also fine. It gives preference to different things, that is, it gives choice to the programmer that you can write your code in the format as per your wish, then what happens when you have the choice, then two three formats are visible. Neither does a programmer think that the dot one is looking simple to me or I am finding the best risk one of the pointer good orI like the Arrow one the best. If I want to use it, then a feeling of personalization starts coming in my code. Yes, we have chosen the syntax as per our wish. Let s talk next. Passing Structures to Function In the same way we can pass variables of different data types, we can also pass variables of structures to a function. Just as we used to pass a number of integer type a and integer type b to a function, in the same way, the variables we create here in structures Student One Student Two Student Three, we can also pass them inside our functions.For example, how do we write the functions which have a structure inside their parameters? Normally, we write the type of the function i.e. the return type and then the name of the function and if we have to write the parameter structure inside it, then first of all we will write the type like we used to write int a, then here in place of int will come structure student and in place of a i.e. in the name of the variable, we will have s1. So if we have to pass on the function as a parameter, suppose we have created a structure student with the name s1.From inside the main function, now I have to call if print info, then inside print info I can simply write s1, so that s1 will go to this function of mine, so now let s write a function to do the same thing, here we will write void print info and then we will write type struct student s1. Now if instead of writing here, we had written this same line above and got it saved, then we would have got an error. The error would have come becauseWe have not yet defined the student. What the compiler does is that it starts line by line from the top. First it read this line and then read this line. Here it got confused that integer is a float character. So I knew what this struct student is till now because it has not read the struct student, that is why the structure is declared first and after that we can use it in other different functions or in fact in our main.Inside the function also, here we have declared our function, let s define it here. Inside this function, we are going to print all our three values. If we ever want to print student s information, then we will call this function. Here we write another print F statement above student information. This time we will use dot operator, we will not be using arrow operator, here we write dot roll number s1.Let s call this print info function for the name and our s1 cp1. Here we have already created a s1. Now we will call the print info and pass it to our s1. So here we passed the edge argument to s1 and inside this s1, our argument will be copied. The structures which are there are called by value, meaning the structure we have created here is not here, this s1 is another structure in which we haveA copy of the argument will be being made, so when we call print info, then two structures will be created inside the memory, both of which will be named s1, so let s save it and run it, now the complete information of the student has been printed to us, now call by value has been done, call by reference, let s check that also a little once, by changing the value of s1 i.e. its roll number, we do it here 1660Earlier it was 1664, now we have changed it to 1660 and now we get this roll number printed inside the main function. What happened after the function call? The roll number printed by the main function is 1664, the original one has not changed because the structures are passed by call by value. Whereas if this change is made, we would have done it inside the main function before this line, then in that case we will have the roll number printed.If it comes to 1660, then it can be changed inside the main function but cannot change the value of the other structure because the parameter there is a copy of the original argument. In the next topic we will talk about, we are going to read the type def keyword. We have read many keywords till now. We have read the case keyword. Int is one of our keywords. Float is a keyword, apart from that, switch is a keyword, break is a keyword, continue is one.Similarly, there is another keyword in C whose name is type def. The work of type def is to create an alias for data types. Now, like our name at home, the name by which we are called is hardly our real name. Everyone has a nickname. It is like suppose your friend is Suresh and his nickname is Chintu. Now we would like to call him by the name of Chintu. It will be better to use his name. If we call him by his official full name then the same work is done. The work of our type deaf type deaf is to create nick names. Nick names i.e. aliases are when there are spies for a person, just like you must have seen James Bond.The alias is whether it is 007 or James Bond, we don t even know whether it is his real name or not, so all the movie actors who have played that role have their name James Bond, so we can assume that James Bond is like an alias, that is, it is a nickname for that character, it is not necessary that it is his real name, so what are aliases? Alias is an alternative, a different name by which we call the same thing, so if weIf we have to create an alias for our data types, then we use our type def keyword. Now we can create this alias for our integer data type also, we can do it for float as well, we can do it for our care too, but these are already small data types. What else can we create a small variable for them? At the most, what we will do is that we will start calling the character by the name of sich, we will start calling the float by the name of fl.You will start calling int by the name of I but you should not call it because I already use it in a lot of loops but its real usage i.e. the real usage of type def comes when we talk about structures because you can give any name to the structure like here I have taken the example that we have created a structure and we have given it a name. But every time we declare a variable of the structure, we will call it computer engineering student.That s why I don t want to write Student instead of Computer Engineering Student , every time I write Structure Computer Engineering Student , I go for a simple name instead of that, so I took that simple name as COE, student s1 in COE and this COE means the structure of the name Computer Engineering Student, so how will this thing be possible, it will be possible with the type def keyword, so whenever we define the structure, we first type in it.Def after that structure and after that the full name of our structure. Then normally we have to define all the parameters of that structure, close the parenthes and then write its alias i.e. this is the real name of our structure and this is its nickname by which we will be calling it. We will write the alias and after that we will write the statement terminator and now if we have to create a variable of the same structure then simply write the alias i.e. we will just write COE here.Student one then a computer and an engineering student one. So let s try it once. First of all, what will we do? Let s remove our code in the main function. Let s create an alias for our assisting student. Here we will write type def. So in front of structure student, simply write type def and in the last its alias is the alias for the student. We have created stu and let s save it. So earlier what we used to do was earlier we used to write structure student s1.Instead of this, now we have to simply write s2 i.e. this entire structure student has been replaced by AU only. Now we neither have to tell the structure nor do we have to create student. Simply we can write ST U. If different, take an example, then we can write type def struct Computer Engineering Student, inside which we will be writing the same three values and we have made its alias COE, so now we will also call it by the name of COE.Instead of this long name, we can create a variable of COE, COE s1. Now in this s1, we assign all the values. Roll number is equal to 1664 s1 CGPA is 9.2. There we can also do ATR CPY in which we will pass s1 name and after that our name. We can also print these values normally. How to print student name is percentage s s1 name then that is complete.Instead of the strict Computer Engineering Student, we simply had to write a small and cute name which did not take time to write nor did it take time to understand and then we defined all the parameters. Or let s run it once and see that after running it we have the correct output. So, if you are creating a structure and you want its name to be Man, now I will have to write Computer Engineering in full. In this case, a new programmer comes, here I cannot just write COE, because COE would be understandable to children, teachers would understand it, but a new coder would not understand it, then there you yes, write the full name while defining the structure, but whenever it is used in other places in the code,If you have to do this then what is the point of writing it again and again, then give a small nickname to your structure there. We can do the same thing for different integers, we can do it for floats as well, we can do it for characters too, but we do not do it because they already have very short names, so there is not much point in giving them aliases in mostly cases, that is why whenever we use type def, mostly in the cases of structures, we use it.Now let us solve some questions based on structures. The first question among these is, enter the address. Is the house number in the address your block number or it can also be called the street number? Our city and our state of five people. Now the first thing we will notice here is that we have to store the address of the people in which house number, block number, city and state are these four parameters. Now the four parameters are same for five people. The house number in it is anyBlock number will be of integer type, this can also be of integer type, city will be our string and state will be our string, so here basically we are being told that you group different types and make an address, then here it will flash in our mind that we will need a variable of G structure type and in this structure, we will need five such variables, we will need five structures to store the information of five people, so what will we do in this, an array.We will create the structures. First we will define the structure named address and then create an array of it and then we will store the information of five people inside that array. Let us go a little deeper into this once and see what we will do first of all, first of all we will write the structure, then the name of our structure, we will write the information of our structure inside it. The first thing in the information will come is our integer house number, after that will come the integer block, then our character string will be our city.Let s make it of 100 characters and after that our character string will come. Let s make it of 100 characters too and here will be our address. So in this way we have to create a structure named our address. After that we will create an array of the same structure i.e. what will we write? Structure address. This is our type infact. What can we do with it by type def? We can also create aliases. We will write here type def. Here we will write ourSo we can write ADD everywhere instead of writing on the structure address. Here for now, let s just look at the structure address. Then we will write the name of our variable. Addresses. For how many people. For five people. In this way, this will be our array of structures. Now in this, either input the information of the five people from the user or by assigning whatever value ourselves, we can get it printed. Now let s code and check the same thing.Let s put this code from here and now let s create a new structure named Structure Address. First of all we will store int house number inside it, after that int block, then we will write character city of 100 then character state of 100 and here we have created a structure named pe statement terminator toy address. Now let s make an array of it. Let us shorten the name of the structure address array, then give it the name AIDS and keep its size five one.Let s create a function to print the address information and take input from the user inside the main function. So first of all, to take the input, enter print enter info for person one. For person one, information will be entered. We will scan that information. First of all, we will get the house number, then the ads of 0 dot house number will come to us in the same way. So, we will write here das d0 d block. Now we will get our string i.e. our city, then d. Then city and then our state and here because we are writing integer, here we have to put m so that we reach the address of block or address of house number. In the same way we will enter the information of four more people. Here we write to and to print all this information we also create a function. We write its name as print address in which we will pass the structure address and in this function we write the addresses this.Now let s get the address combined and printed. How to get it combined and printed? First of all, we will write the house number, percentage D. After the house number, we will put a comma. After this, we will write our block number, percentage D. After the block number, we will write percentage s, our city and then percentage s. Our state. Here we write add dot. First of all, our house number will come, then add dot, our block, then add dot, our city and then finally d dot, our state is completed in a single line.We have to store the complete address of , just like in our normal daily life, we write the complete address in a single line, then we save it and run this entire code. First, what do we do with our main function, we call the print address function for the value. First of all, we will call the add of zero and four more similar calls. We are going to apply a little formatting which will fix it so that good formatting gives me the code.Now if we save it and run it, we will have to add a lot of information, so let s add this information quickly. First, we have entered the house number, then we have entered the block number. First we have to enter both the integers, then we have to enter two strings. First the city, then our state. We have entered the information of five people and we have got the address of all five. Address One, we have entered this address.This was entered in address two, this was entered in address three, this was entered in address four and this in address five. We are entering all this information in different ways. In this same question, we have learned a lot of concepts. Firstly, how to define the structure, secondly, how to use the structure inside the function, thirdly, how to create an array of structures. Obviously, there is input and output in a single question.Many of our concepts have been revised. Next question which we will be talking about is Create a structure to store vectors and then make a function to return sum of two vectors. First of all, let s talk about what is a vector actually. If I search for vectors, then in the list of vectors, we have some such figures. So, vectors are geometric entities. Those who have studied mathematics or mathematics, they will already know this.What are vectors? We have some entities which have a direction and along with it a magnitude, our y axis is now how to define vectors, vectors are straight lines on our 2D plane withLet s call it y capital y and it will have some distance from the y axis, let s call it KapiThe formula remains, this helps us programmers and coders not to get into the math thing. The simple concept is to remember that whenever a vector has to be defined, there will be anHow to calculate vectors in math, suppose we have the first vector x1 a cap y1 h cap and the second vector we have x2 a cap y2 h cap then the sum of these two comes out to us x1 x2 i ca That is, it will be stored inside a separate variable. y1 y2 j cap and it will be stored inside a separate variable, so the value of one variable goes to the same, the value of the other variable goes to the same, so in this way we will sum it. If we do it with the help of code, then we will understand things in a better way. First of all, what do we do, let s create a structure for the structure vector. Now a vector has two components.There will be an x component, there will be a y component, so here we will write intBut if we create theDon t forget here that we have to calculate a sum vector of these two vectors. For the sum vector, first create a strict vector sum. Initialize the sum with zero, that means there is no value in it right now and we have to create a function to calculate the sum. So we write void calculate sum in it. Three vectors will be passed inside it. The first one will be the strict vector, that will be v1, after that will come the strict vector v2, after that will come the strict vector sum, to create this function.Let s define here, what we have to do is that the x component of the sum will be theWhat we are missing out here is that whenever the function is called, it is passed by value, so here the sums that we have assigned values will not be reflected inside the main function, that is why to reflect them, we either pass a pointer or get our sum printed inside this function. Print sum of a is percentage d sum d x and sum for our component sum of y is sum dva put here.Let s give a bus and call inside the main function, pass the calculate sum to the calculate sum v1 v2 and our sum vector save and run, so in v1 we passed 5 aa cap 10 h cap, in v2 we passed 3 aa cap 7 h cap so what is the sum?Actually, here we do not understand how to use them well, when we initially learn the concept, suppose you are making a shooter game, C and C are very similar, just like there are structures inside C , similarly we can create classes, they do not exist inside C, so when you read C , or Java, then we will know what a class is, but the structure is similar, there when we create a game.When we use C P in development, many times what we have to do is to define the velocity. At what speed are we going to fire the bullet? At what speed will we show the speed of our main character? What will be his velocity if someone has thrown something or let s say like in our Angry Birds, what will be the vectors in it, what will be the direction, what will be the Magni Doodle for throwing stones or birds.In all the work that is done, similar structures are used. This type of calculation is done which comes from the formulas of Math and Physics but we convert it into coding. The next question we will be solving is create a structure to store complexity. What were complexity numbers? There was a number whose part is real. And some part was imaginary, some part of it would be real, some part would be imaginary, just like a vector, we have to create a structure, we will name it of complex type and our inner part is also of integer type, we will be creating some structure like this and we have to print the value from the arrow operator, so first of all, what will we do above, let s create a structure above the structure complex term terminator, then this is our done.Inside the complexation, we will create the actually complex number. First of all, we will write that we want to keep the strict complexation part and now how will we get it printed. It has to be printed with the arrow operator and for the arrow operator, we need a pointer, so first of all let s create a pointer. What will be the type of pointer? Structure complex of number one. Now we have to print the values, so we can get them printed. The imaginary part is equal to percentage d.How to print from pointer, first of all we will write parenthesis or here we will use arrow operator, then PTR arrow will be real here, real will be there and here PTR arrow will be imaginary and base sl n, so let s save it and now let s run it, so the real part is printed with us, five and the imaginary part is printed with us, and in this way, even with imaginary real numbers, like if you have Magni Doodle, then it is under.The score is the square of the imaginary part plus the real part. So now if we have to calculate the magnitude of the complex or the magnitude of the vectors, then that is our under root, the square of the imaginary part plus the square of the real part. So we can calculate that also and get it. So, we have the full capability to complicate it a little based on these structures. Next one of the theorems is to test your concept. You have to storeThe marks of 30 students. We have to store the marks of 30 children. Our marks will be of either integer type or float type. Now what will we use? Float type marks are what we are learning here. Either make an array of 10 floats or make a structure. Now if we have to store the marks of 30 children here and each value is of our float type, then the smart decision here will be to make an array of 10 floats.What will be the benefit of making floats of 10? Above the structure, first of all, the major use of structures is when we are collecting things of different types together, but here we have to collect 30 things of the same type, i.e. of float type, so for that it will be better that we can make an array, we can make both, our question will be solved by both, but it will be smarter, more experience. The decision will be that you will make an array of 10.Or in fact, here you are making 30 floats. Next question is, make a structure to store bank account information of a customer. It is ABC Bank. You have to store the information of the bank account in it and also create an alias for it, that is, here we will be using type def. Now what information can we store for the bank account, it can be one, the name of the account holder can be one, the account number can be one, apart from this, our IFSC code can be one, not in so much detail.For now, we will just store the name and our account number. Let s create a structure for this, Struck Bank Account. What will be stored inside the bank account? First of all, the account number will be stored. Int account number. After that, our string character will be stored whose name will be name of 100 characters. Now here we have to create an alias for it. So to create an alias, first of all we will write type def and instead of bank account, we will write ACCC. Only account and we will write it as account number, then in the name of ACC, we will create ourYou can declare the variables which are in the structure. First of all, we will create account one of ACC type. Values are already assigned in it. Account number will be tooth and name will be ours. Shraddha will come. In the same way, if we want to create another account, then second we can open account two. In this, the account number will be increased by one. Our name will be changed. In the same way, we can create account three. In the same way, it will also be increased by one and our name will be changed. So what happened?We can change the account number. We can change the name. And only we had to write ACC. We did not have to write this entire structure of bank account. Values can also be printed in the same way. Print A account number is equal to percentage. A1 account number and name percentage. A1 saves and runs it. So, our account number is 12 2 3. Our name is Shraddha. And this whole thing is printed on the screen. So in this way we can create Alice. We can create them with the help of type def.And by using our structures, we can do many interesting things in C. So here I will give a special homework problem. There are no separate problems here. The homework problem will be that either for our school or for our college or for any company. We have to create such a database with the help of structures in which we can store the information of the people living there. For example, we will give an example here.If you are taking a college then you will have to create a structure in the college to store the student s formation, a structure will have to be created to store the teachers information and we can say that we will create a structure to store the information of the rest of the staff, the admin staff, then with the help of these three structures, before you will save the information, you can also do different different segue guns in it, like we have taken the information of the student in that also.You can make different arrays that these are COE students, these are first year students, these are second year students, third year IT students, these are fourth year mechanical students, in that way you will have to see that according to which you want to store the information, then this homework problem is that for your particular college, whatever branches are there in your college, according to the way the system is maintained, you will get a complete array.The system has to be created with the help of structures in which you can store the information, the user can also enter the information in it and you can also get the information printed. Now we are going to start with our Chapter 10, whose name is File Input Output. Now to understand this, first of all, let us understand the memory of our computer a little. There are two types of memory present inside our computer, one of them is volatile memory, that is, as soon as the power of the computer is switched off.You unplug the laptop, the battery gets discharged, similarly this memory evaporates and there is another type of memory, our non volatile memory, this memory stores such data inside itself which does not change due to power failure, it remains the same as whenever you open your computer, maybe you have downloaded a game, then every time you will see that game, you can open it or you have the power of the cutter gets exhausted. If your laptop is switched off, what will happen when you come back?You may not be able to see that file or the new changes you made in it may not be visible to you because they were stored in our volatile memory. Now the volatile memory inside the computer is RAM, we also call it random access memory. Now in the basics of computer science, we will know that there is a RAM, there is a ROM, there are many types of memory inside the computer. Here, we are assuming that whenever we are talking about volatile memory, we are talking about RAM and whenever we are talking about non volatile memory.If we are talking about hard disk, you can store a lot of data inside the hard disk of the computer. In fact, after extracting that data, you can give it to someone else and then give it to your friend. You can go to another computer and transfer it. So what do people usually do? They backup all their data inside the hard disk, then remove it and install a new hard disk in the computer. In this way, many people keep storing a lot of their data for years. Now here s the thing about our work.This will happen that the data keeps getting transferred between the volatile memory of the computer and the non volatile memory, just like your computer program is stored in our memory, the program becomes a part of the volatile memory and it is possible that there are many such files lying in your computer system, they would be lying on our hard disk. The computer program inside can write those files and can also read them, then any part inside the computer program i.e. RAM wants to access the files which are stored in the non volatile memory i.e. in our hard disk, so this process is done with the help of C. Different different programming languages have different ways to access the files and in this chapter, we are going to understand the input output in the file i.e. come file.How is it performed inside the computer? So first of all let s talk about what a file is. There is a container inside the file memory in a storage device to store data. Here our store device will be our hard disk. So there are different containers inside the hard disk. We can also call them chunk of memory. A lot of data will be stored inside each chunk of memory and we file the same data. Just like in schools, we will have some files stored in colleges which will be with our teachers.Some of our personal data will be stored in those files which will be with our admin department. Suppose I have a file whose name is Shraddha Khapar. I may have a classmate whose file may be in her name. In this way, just like there are files in real life, similarly there are different files inside the computer system. In fact, if we have ever used a computer before, we must have seen some or the other file inside our system. Now whenever we talk about files, we always have to remember this.r is volatile, now its contents are lost when the program terminates, that is, as soon as the program ends, as soon as our C program ends, our data gets automatically cleared because our program is inside the ROM, the program is inside the ROM, which means the variables of our program are also inside the ROM, that is why we write the code of C, in which we create a variable of int n, create an array, create our string, all of these are inside the ROM.Come and all of them are in the volatile memory. As soon as your program ends, these variables will also be cleared from the memory, that is why files are used to pass the data. So what to do that if we want our variables, our data should not remain in the memory and should go to some permanent storage. If we are able to store that data in some way or the other, then for that we use files. Just like suppose you had created a program, we have just told you in the structure section thatThe data of school or college students is to be input into your program. Now as soon as your program ends, that data will be lost. Next time to get your data back, you will have to run the program again and ask the user again. But if you want to ask the user only once to store it somewhere, then where will we store it? We will be storing it permanently inside our computer system in the things called files. Now first of all let us talk about what operations we can do on the files.We can imagine the file in the same way as we have files in real life, just like the file is inside our computer system, the first operation is that we can create the file, secondly we can open the file, we can close it. To read the data of any file, we have to first open it and after reading it, we have to close it. We can read the data from it and can also write the data in it, i.e. we can write the data. First of all, let us talk about the types of files.Within our system, we will mainly talk about two types of files, the first of which is our text files. The data inside the text files is textual, that is, if you open it and look at it, you will not see the real data, ABC, D, A, sentences will be written in it or some numbers will be written in it, which means when the opened data will be visible to you, it will make sense. The second type of files for us are our binary files. The data inside the binary files is stored in the form of rows and keys.Or there will be a big sequence in which there will be days and ones and that will not be making any sense to us. We call that type of file a binary file. Now the binary file also has different types. There can be formats like if we talk about extensions then our binary file is d mp3mp 4jp which contains our photos etc. all these are extensions of our binary files and if we talk about non binary files then d txx.com is also a TT file. If we talk about dot java then it is also a TT file because we will understand the data written in it and if we edit it then those changes will be visible to us and they will be visible to us.If we make sense, then we have one text file and one binary file. Now here we will mostly work on text files because we do not know how to code in binary. But if we go to write C code, then with C we can edit binary files too, we can read, write, close, open everything, but from the exam point of view or from the interview point of view, mostly the things that will be asked to us will be from the text file.Will be related, first of all let s talk about how do we access the files, we said that we have a RAM inside which we have our program and variables and he wants to create a permanent data storage and input and output the data from it i.e. read, write, open and close that file, but how will all this work be done? All this work is done with the help of our file points. Now the file we have inside C inside the computer, it is a hidden structure structure.A file is hidden from us, meaning it is hidden from us, we cannot make any changes inside that structure, we cannot bring any changes, that is why the entire declaration of that structure is hidden from us and according to every system, it has its own separate file structure, like whenever you go to read the data from the pert storage, all the data is read in a structure and it is necessary to create that structure whenever we are opening any file.There is a file pointer which points to the structure, so the file pointer that points to the structure and is used to access the file is called the file pointer. File pointer is a special type of pointer whose type is our file because we have created the structure of the file. So with the help of that file pointer, we can open a file, close it, write things in it, read things from it and in factYou can also create files. Now the syntax to write it is something like this, first of all we write type, here our file is typed because file is a structure, after that we wrote ast risk i.e. star, after that we can write any variable here because it is a pointer to a file, so we have written F PTR. If you write PTR or fp4 is a kana name for us, we will use F PTR so that there is some distinction that it is normal.The pointers of variables are PTR and we are calling the pointers of the file as FPTR, so first of all we create this FPTR inside our code. We will write FILE which means our file type and after that we will write star f patti aa, so what have we done about the file type, we have declared a pointer to FPTR. Now how to use this pointer, that is, how will it open the files, then to open the file and to close it,If we talk about syntax, first of all let s talk about opening the file, once we have created F PTR, after that we have a function named F Open. Now mostly we will discuss the functions of files, there will be an F in front of them, which makes it very clear that a file has a function, whether it is to open, to close, to read characters, to write, or to do many things, but there will be one common thing.That there is F in front of the function of the files so that it can be seen from a distance that it is the function of the file, then to open the file there is a function named f open. It takes two parameters, the first parameter of which is the name of the file. If suppose we have created a file called txt.gz mode, it tells us whether we have to read inside the file or write inside the file or do some other work because our program should know to our system that if we are opening any file then what is it.With what intention are you opening it in this mode because there are some changes at the system level? There are things that have to happen if you have to read, then some things are going on internally at the buffer level which for now we will not go into that much detail. Basically our system should know what is our intention to open any file so that it can make our work a little easier. If we tell in advance that we have to write, then it will make the work easier and will make it easier to read. So, from this perspective, we would have accepted it.Now here we have assigned it to the file pointer. Have we opened our file by passing two parameters in it and finally assigned its value in F.PTR, that is, what this F.Open would have done is that it would have returned a pointer to the file which we would have stored in F.PTR. So this is the statement to open the file. Now to open the file, it is necessary to have the file first, so we create a file, inside our same folder we will go here.This icon will be created from a new file.The first parameter inside txt.gz f open is the name of the file i.e. test d txt.gz. You will also practice or you can see your old questions of any college. There are many easy questions from this topic, that is, from a topic like array, you can ask very difficult questions, but files are such a topic which is a little complex in itself. If we ask questions from here, they will be easy to us, so let us recap the file named FPTR.Created a pointer, opened the file inside FPTR and assigned value to it. We used the F open function in which we passed two parameters, one is the name of our file and one is our mode. Now we can close the file in the same way as we opened it. The function to close is ours. F close. The syntax of writing F close is very easy. F and then close and inside just put the pointer of the file which we have to close. Now the logic behind closing.This is that whenever we open any file, our system comes to give us the resources that you will need this much memory, you will need this resource, you will need that resource because you are going to do an important thing because reading any data from your permanent memory is an important task for the system, so it has given us the resources, but now if the work of our file is finished for us once, that is, we have read it and also written in it, then the work is finished now.We should give those resources back to our system as per our wish. However, even if we do not close the file, there will be no problem, but whenever we write big codes, it is highly advised in it. It is a very good practice that at the end of the program, when you have finished working with the file, then you must close the file because the resources of your system are being lost. If your system is getting slow by opening the file, then the system sTo increase efficiency, you have to always close your files so that the compiler knows that the work on the file here is finished, so now we do not have to do any work but we close our file and write here pay f close and will pass the file pointer f ptr inside. So what happened here, the file was opened, we did not have to do any work, so we simply closed the file here with pay f close. Next let s talk about what is in the file.In what modes can we open any file? Now the first mode we read was the r one, that is, we are opening the file to read it. The second one is our RB. If we open it in RB mode, then the file is read in binary format, so it will usually be for binary files. It is not of much use to us right now, but yes, if in your question paper, in the test in your college, a question comes that you should open a binary file.Or if you open it in binary form, then you have to keep in mind that we have to use r as mode. No, now there is no special thing about both of these functions. One special thing about these two functions is that if suppose the file does not exist, you want to call h and load s, no one has ever created it, then what will happen, then null will be stored inside the pointer, so in write mode, in read mode and in read binary mode, both. If your file does not exist then a null pointer will be created inside the pointer i.e. it will be stored next, let s talk about our write key, your intention inside the write mode is that you want to write something inside the file and write binary i.e. you want to write something in binary format inside your file. Now here also a special thing comes here whenever you go to write the file na and a. Suppose you have reloaded the file again.If you try to open and write the things in it, hello dot does not exist, then both these functions i.e. write and write binary will create that file. If it does not exist, you have not created the file but you want to write, then let us create it for you. This type of system exists and if the file already exists, suppose you have a file in which you have stored some data and you want to write it in write or write binary format.If you open it in these modes, then first your file will be opened, then the data inside it will be deleted and after that, the data that needs to be written will be written, then the data of your entire file gets overwritten. If you open it with write or write binary, but you want the old data to also be saved and my new data below it gets stored, then in that case we use append i.e. use A as a mode.Append means adding locks to the old one, then your new data will start getting added after the old data. So, these are the five most important modes which we can use. Whenever we open a file, now first of all let us look at a best practice. Our best practice is that if we are opening a file for reading, then before reading the data from it, first of all we should check whether our file also exists, then the file exists.We write the code to check whether it does or not. Suppose we are trying to open a file whose name is New Test. Now if New Test does not exist, then we just discussed that if F is in read mode inside PTR, then what would have come inside F PTR. If NULL would have come, then we can put a condition in it that if A PTR is equal to E is equal to NULL, in that case we will get it printed on the file dozen asist if it is not so.So it means that our file has been opened and now we will close the file, so we did a very simple thing, we had already read that if we open the file in read mode, if our file does not exist then what will happen, there will be null inside F PTR, so on the same we put a check that if F PTR is null then get it printed, the file does not exist and if there is any value in F PTR, then it is okay, there is no work right now, so let us close it.If there was any work to be done then here we would have written a statement in this way to get that work done, then save it once and run it, let s see what is the output. File creation exists because the file named New Test does not exist yet, we have not created it. Now here, if we had written w instead of r, then what would have happened for us in write mode. If we want to open this NewTest d txt.gz t EXT, then compile and run, then at the end, what happened is this suddenly.A newly created file has come for us and we can also open this file. Now the file is empty because we have not written anything in it, but that file has been created for us. Next let s talk about reading from a file. Now you have learned to open the file, you have learned to close it, you have learned how to read the data from it. So we have opened it. Now how to read its data, so we read the data with the help of file pointer. First of all, let s say, to read the data, we scan F and print F.Instead of F scanf and F print F, we use two functions, with these we can read different types of data, it can be string data, it can be character data, it can be integer data, it can also be float data, so in F scanf, like inside scanf, if we talk about scanf, what scanf used to do, first of all it used to take the format specified of the variable, then there were two parameters inside it, but inside our F scanf there are three parameters, out of whichFirst is our file pointer, second is our format specified of variable, so first of all we will tell which file. If we want to read the data, then we will write F scan F, inside it we will write the file pointer, after that we will write what kind of data is being read, suppose we are reading a character from that file and after that where we have to read that character and store it, then for that we have already created a variable named character, so for that we have already created a variable of character type C in which we will read our data by characterizing it. Now how is this data being read like?What does scanf do? We press different keys from the keyboard and scanf keeps reading them. There is a similar system. All the data is written inside the file of fsnf. We have to learn that it is also being pressed like the keys of the keyboard and as we keep getting that data, in the same way it keeps getting scanned by f scanf i.e. it keeps getting input. We can check it once with the code also in our test.L is what has been written and saved and we want to read a character from our file, so what will we do first of all, let s create a character C, now we will scan F, in which we will first pass the file pointer, after that we will pass our specified format i.e. percentage C and after that we will print the address of our variable, the address of C. Now we will print whatever variable we have read, the character is equal to percentage C and we will print this character C and at the end.What we will do is close our file by F PTR, save it and run it once, nothing is printed here, something is not printed because we have opened a new test, we have to open the test and here we say clear compile , then after running it, we still have the value of the character not printed because we have it opened, it is still in write mode, we will have to open it in read mode, compile it once again.Let s compile and run and then we have got our character e equal to a . What it did is, we get it scanned and store it inside the same variable, like we have already printed the value of s , now again we read the next character in s itself and get it printed here and we will do this same thing again and again five times because we have to read the entire l , let s save it and run it too, so pay attention here.If we look at our output screen, first of all it read A, then it read P, then again it read P in the character and then the fourth character which it read is L and the fifth character is E, so in a way we go character by character and our entire word has been read. Now suppose here, we do not store characters, we store some numbers like 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 8. So now we have stored these numbers.Now we do not store the characters, they also take the case text. This time we have to read the data of integer type. Let us keep it constant and for the integer type here, we will have to change only the percentage D and SI. We have written only three numbers, that is, there are only three numbers inside the test, so we will scan and print it only three times. Let s save and run it once. First of all, 1 2 3 has been read for us and it has come.What did you do with 12 and 23? We stored 456 inside an integer and got it printed. Then we stored 898 inside a single integer and got it printed. So here, if the floating values were strings, we have other types of integers, then we can scan all the things that are there with scanf and print them on our screen, not with scanf, but with scanf.Which is used exclusively for files. Now just as we can read data from a file, we can also write the data. Our function used for writing is F Print F. Inside F Print F also we have three parameters which are passed. The first one is our file pointer and the second one is our format. The value of the variable has to be printed on this format specifications. So let s try this also. What will we do with our file i.e. test file.If we are going to write something stored inside, then let s remove it here, then first of all we write F print F F print F. First of all the argument will go inside the file pointer, after that our character will go inside the character. First of all we want to send our M and in the same way we will keep sending different different characters A N G and O. Let s save it and now let s run it. Let s test it once in the beginning. Now there is L inside the D .The text was the complete data, we replace it whenever we write, but this time if we want to append, that is, if we open this file in append mode, then what is the mango? Now let s see what is the output. After this, another mango has been added. Now in this case, when we appended, our old data is not erased. We have added some additional things to that data. Next let s talk about what if we read a file only character by character.One thing you have to do is to apply format specification by applying percentage C and then do F print F or F scanf, otherwise there are two special functions for this inside the files, the first function of which is F get C and the second function is F put C. What does F get C do? Get C means get character brings the character from inside the file and F put C puts a character inside the file, so it is used to read the characters.And this is used to write the characters inside the file. The syntax of both of them is quite simple. What you do inside F get s is simply put your file pointer, that is, earlier our syntax was going on, what we were doing with F scanf, first of all we used to put the file pointer, after that we used to put percentage C and after that we used to put the address of the character in which we have to read and store the data. Now we have done this step here andIf this step is removed then things will become easier. Here we simply have to pass a file pointer and what this file pointer will do is simply go inside our function and this function will return to us and give us the character which it has read from inside our file, similar thing will do our put s, what put s will do, first it will take the character which has to be written inside the file, then it will take the pointer of the file in which it has to be written and simply read that file.Going inside, it will write that character, that is, we read our data from these two as well F Put C and F Get C. What we did earlier was print F. This time, first of all, we will open our file in read mode and will write here F Get C PTR. Now from here the character will be returned to us but we will have to get it printed as well. Along with that, we print F. Percentage C This E F PTR. Now we copy this code five times.Let s get it done, whatever is inside the test, reinstall the L which is there, now save our code and run it once. Output, we will analyze whether the same will come and the output will come i.e. our character by character which is read from the file has been printed for us on our screen using F Get C. Similarly, if we open our file in write mode and this time we want to write, we comment out this also, simply we have to write f.Put C inside it, first of all we will write our character and the pointer of our file. We will try to do the same thing. L is stored inside our test file. We want to replace it with Mango. So, we are going to open this file in write mode and write Mango. With the help of Put C, save it and run it. So now look at the test file, Mango has come for us instead of L. So if you want to do it for the character, then you can also scan F for the character.Or we can also do F get C, but if we have other data types like string, integer, float, etc. then for all of them we know that we have to use F scanf or F print F. Next let s talk about EOF. EOF is a special thing which is also called end of file. Now this EOF exists in different languages. EOF of C is capital EOF. It is also small in Java.If EOF occurs then EOF is the end of file. When we read characters from F gate C, then as soon as inside our file By reading characters one by one, all our characters are exhausted, then our F get C returns EOF and returning EOF means EOF is like NULL. If NULL was returned, we knew that the file does not exist. Similarly, when EOF returns, we come to know that we have reached the end of our file, which means we have traversed all the data and read it. Now there is no such data inside our file.Whenever we read the data through F gate, the advantage of reading the characters is that after reading the data, we get the EOF. For example, suppose we have stored a lot of data inside our file, this is a random string of words, so we have stored a lot of data in this manner and if we want to read this entire data, then to read this entire data, we will have to read it character by character plus at the end we add aYou will put a limit on how long you have to read till the EO comes, then write a simple code for it, you will notice that inside each code, these two lines of opening and closing the file are constant. After declaring the file pointer, now we are going to open this file in read mode and read it character by character, so first of all let s make character C which is going to read all the values, now inside C is the first one.Let s get the first character read. How will we get the first character read? F gate C will put F ptr inside it. So by putting F ptr inside F gate C, we will read our character and store it in a variable named C. After this, what will we do? We put a while loop. Why while loop because we have to read the characters one by one in the form of a loop again and again, like if we go inside the test, then first of all we will read t.Then we will read H, then we will read I, then we will read A, then this is the space, we will be reading it, then again I will be reading A in this way, the whole string of words will be affected, here the paragraph would have been completed, you have google2, percentage C, the same character which we have just read and read it again, that is, inside the stitch, now we will take the new value f from gut s inside it, f ptr and finally we will print the next line.Let us understand this code very carefully on the console. Character CA. We have taken a dummy character, after getting the data read inside it, we will get the data stored here from the file. Got the first character read and then put a loop. Inside the loop, we have to keep reading the characters till the end of the file comes, then it shows the condition till the character is not equal to the end of the file. Now we will keep printing the same, then read the next character again and then print it.We will get it done again, we will read the next character, we will get it printed again, we will read the character again and again until we come to the end of the file inside this character. As soon as the end of the file comes, we will get the next line printed on the console and close our file, save it and now run it from the terminal, the entire same sentence has been printed on our screen. This is a random string of words which we had inserted inside our text file, so wheneverIf you want to read the entire file, use F gate C and how to track it. Now let s ask the first question with the help of end of file. Our question says, make a program to read five integers from a file. We have to take a file and read five integers from it. So, let s write five integers inside our test file. 1 2 3 4 and 5. Let s save it. Now let s make a program. In fact, this is the program.What will we do, we will create a file pointer from the beginning, we have taken it, now we will open the file, then f ptr e f open, first of all we will pass the name of the file f is test dty, after that we will pass our mode, we have to read, now we will create an integer variable n in which we are going to read the numbers f scanf percentage d, before that f ptr and store the number in n, after that we will print that number on the screen number e is equal to percentage d and thisSame thing repeat for number five If you want to do this then we save this entire code and in the end we do not forget to close our file and write inside it F PTR Save and Run. This has generated some error for us because here we had to put the address of n. We will pass it in our F scanf. Save and now run. So the numbers are read one by one. One, 2, 3, 4 and five are read in the same order in which we have written them in our file.Next question was written inside, let s make a program to input student information from a user and enter it to a file, then what will we do with the user, we will take the information of the student, in this information we are going to take the name of the student, after that take the age of the student, take the marks or call it CGPA so that we can also make float type, then we take these three information of the student and thisIf we store it inside a file, then we delete it. First of all, we open a file.To get the information, first of all we write print F, enter name, make a string, character name of 100 characters, percentage s and write the name here, now let s scan our name, percentage s and our name, what will we do after that, after that we will get the age of the student entered, let s make a variable for that too, int age and float CGPA, so there are a few different parts, this is the part with the file, this is the part with our internal variable.Here we are taking information from the user Control C Control v Here we will enter CGPA percentage f Now what we have to do is to write all this information inside our file i.e. we have opened the file with F Open and if we want to write all the information inside it then we will use it for that. How to do F print F? First of all we write F print F and pass it inside F PTR. Now we first want to write our string then we will write name and after the string we want to put comma end.After the comma, we want the information that is in the next line to go or in fact, we format this information with tab spaces, then we will write F print F F PTR, after this we want to display our edge and pass our edge F print F F PTR Percentage F. Save our CGPA once. First of all, the name will be printed, then the tab space will come, then the edge will be printed, then the tab space will come, then CG will be on, all this will be inside the student file.This is the one which we will create a new one and at the end we will close the file. Now run the code once. The array which is in itself is a pointer, so this character array which is name is itself a pointer, so there is no need to put em percent here, let s clear it and now run. So, we have entered the name, we have entered the age, we have entered the marks i.e. CGPA and now automatically the file has been created for us which is Student, our name.Then the tab space has come, then the edge has come, then the tab space has come, then our marks have come, in this way we can format our data. If we had to format this data in a different way, then here we would have written the student name, after that, we have written the student age and all the information which is there, in the next next line, we have to do it and here we write student CGPA. Let s save this once, let us run it again, we have written the name.Entered our age again. Again we entered the marks. This time our file was already created whose name is student. If we open student then now our data has come to us in this format first name then age inside the next line then CGPA inside the next line then different ways. If we have to do formatting while writing inside the file then we can do that also. Next let s do our question number 63.Our question says, write a program to write all the odd numbers from one to n in a file, that is, we have to create a file and inside it all the odd numbers from one to n. Come here, we have to write in it and whatever n is, this n will be given to us by our user. So the user will input n and run a loop from one to n. We will extract the number d and write it inside the file. So let s close it. There is a new file inside our program and try to open it. Right se f ptr it f open the name of our file odd dt xt end and we are opening it in write mode.Even if it does not exist, it will be created automatically. Now we read it from the user. Integer and print enter a scanf percentage d and n. After this we run the loop int aa 0 aa until lesson is equal to n. In fact start aa from one to n. Now to check the odd, we have to write if aa modelo 2 is not equal to 0 when i divided by 2. Cry in reminder.Will not give meaning if our number is odd then the number is odd so now we have to write it in the file. How will we write it in the file? With the help of F print F we will print F. The first parameter will be pass our file pointer inside which we have to write. After that we will pass the type format specified and will separate these numbers with a tab space. We will get them printed in the next line. Let s save it and finally we have closed the file.Let s run it. Suppose we want the first 10 odd numbers, then automatic odds.All the numbers which are odd till tx1 are printed for us 1 3 5 7 and 9. Let s do the next question. The next question says that there are two numbers written inside a file. One number is a, the other number is b. These numbers are already written inside the file. Now write a program to replace them with their even. What do we have to do? Suppose this is a file, there are already two and three numbers written inside it.We have to read these two from the file a, we will bring two in b, we will bring three and after cleaning this file from inside, that is, after deleting its data, we have to write the sum of both the numbers in it, that is, there should be only five inside it, at the end, our system will be something like this, so what will be the logic behind doing this, first of all we will read the data, first we will open the file in read mode, after that after closing the file, we will open it in our write mode and as soon as we open it in write mode, then what will happen automatically?If it gets overwritten, the old data will be deleted. Till then we will store that data in int a and b inside our local variables, so for this also we write the code. First of all, create a file like txt.gz, inside it we will pass f ptr end and then int b and address of b for the integer jr b which specifies our format. Now we have read a and b and now we close the file. After closing the file, now we will open it again.You can open it again with the help of the same pointer. In your write mode, we will open it in write mode and print F inside the file. We will add the data A PTR Percentage D. Our sum i.e. a and b. Now we will close the file again. So first of all we read a and b. We closed the file with the file and opened it next time. What did we do in write mode in write mode? Now we overwrote inside the file a b i.e. both.Sum the numbers and close the file again. Now let s run it. What did txt.gz do? Replace two and three with five. We have discussed many of the functions which are on the top of the file. You can solve different questions with the help of files and there are very simple questions, just what has to be done, three four functions have to be memorized. The best tip to memorize is that already.For egistify you put F and it is a very easy syntax, meaning F open and F close are very easy. I would say that these are the functions which get stuck in the mind and now let us read towards our last and next chapter which is Chapter 11 in which we will read about Dynamic Memory Allocation. So now we are going to start with our Chapter 11 and our last chapter which is named Dynamic Memory Allocation now.Before talking about dynamic memory allocation, let us understand how memory is allocated. Whenever we write a program, one is static memory allocation and one is dynamic memory allocation. Whenever we write a C program and inside it we make some When we create a variable, what the C compiler does is that it checks the data type of that variable and already allocates the memory accordingly, that is, reserves it, but sometimes such cases may come in which our requirement of memory may change in the middle of the code, like if suppose you have created an array and in that array you want to store how many children are enrolled in your class, then suppose there are 30 children in your class.And you have created an array according to 30 children, but in the middle of the year, three new children enroll in your class, then for that, will you create a new array whose size will be 33, in it you will copy the old values and also copy the new values, then this becomes a bit tricky situation in which a lot of energy is wasted, that is why we need dynamic memory allocation because there is a way by which we can decide in the middle of the program.How much memory do we need? If we had taken less earlier then we can increase it. If we had taken more earlier then we can reduce that memory in the middle of the program to save resources. So in dynamic i.e. run time we will be able to decide how much memory is to be allocated. So dynamic memory allocation is to allocate memory to a data structure during the run time. So there are two times, one is our compile time and one is our run time compile.That is, when the C compiler is running and it is analyzing how many memories an integer variable will require, how much memory a float variable will require, how much memory a string will require, and then there is our run time memory allocation. Run time means when our code is actually running, when the console window is open, the user is inputting something in it, some output is being produced. The time between the start and end of the program is called run time.We want to do dynamic memory allocation. For this, we need some functions. By using those functions, we are playing dynamic with the memory, so in this topic we will be talking about four functions in this chapter. Majorly, the first function of which is our Malac Malac stands for memory allocation, the second is our Calc, Calc is continuous allocation, the third is our free function and the fourth is our Re Alloc i.e. Re.Allocation Now we will be reading about these four functions in detail in this entire chapter and all four functions are very easy to write. In fact, if I talk about a computer program, out of all the 10 chapters that we have read till now, this chapter should be the easiest because it has only four functions and we are going to understand it in a very easy way. First of all, let s talk about the function. The first function is our Malac. Now the work of Malac function is something special.Allocating the amount of memory Suppose you need 14 bytes of memory or 30 bytes of memory, then Malak will lock and give that memory to you. In the middle of the code, it takes the number of bytes to be allocated. The terms in which it measures the memory are the terms in bytes, that is, you have to tell it in bytes, I need so many bytes of memory and it will return a pointer of type void. What will it do to us?Within the total memory, assume those particular bytes will be x bytes, it will take a chunk sent by you and will assign a pointer to it, PTR, whose type will be void and through this pointer, now you will be able to access this memory, then it will take x number of bytes, accordingly it will make space inside the memory ofWhat is the syntax to write this? First of all we write malac, our number of bytes will go inside malac. Now here number of bytes, we have given some interesting thing. First we have written five and then we have multiplied it with size of int. Now this size of is our function and what does this function do? This function returns us the size of any data type. If we have written size of int then it will return the size of int. If we have written size of float.So it will return the size of the float. If we wrote size of character then it will return the size of character. Now according to my machine, I know that it will return four floats and one character. May be your machine is 32 bit or you are working on some other system. In that case, what is the size of integer. Should it return two for you or return any other size of any other data type? It depends on what is your system. According to your system, if you want to know how many bytes of memory does this data type take for me, then it will return this size of function.So once we see the size of int, first of all, how does it work? If I want to print the percentage, size of int and along with it, size of float and size of character, once I save it and run it, we have to ignore the warnings. Yes, so the size of int has come to us in four bytes, the size of float has also come in four bytes and the size of character has come in one byte. So this is the size of operator with the help of which we can print any data type.You can bring the size to yourself, so here what we have done is that inside the mallac, we have multiplied five by the size of the integer. Now what is the size of the integer. The size of the integer is four, so what will it do, it will bring 20 bytes of memory and give it to us. If suppose you want to take 14 bytes of memory, then what will happen for you, 14 bytes will be reserved. Now what can you do in this, within 12 bytes, you can store four integers and twoYou can store two characters inside a byte, but I had to store only five integers in this memory, that is why I took a memory which is a multiple of an integer, that is why 5 multiplied by 4 is 20 bytes of memory. Malak will bring it to me. Actually, he has given me a pointer to this memory whose type is void, so it is a void type pointer, but I wanted an integer type pointer, that is why I used it here.This has been typecast and for this typecast, we write star int and not int star, so I have got memory of int star type, in which memory I have 20 bytes, that is, I can store five integers in it and I have stored this entire pointer in this variable ptr. Now if we have to access this memory, then we will access it in the form of ptr. Also, to use the Malak, we have to add a std ae bd a above.Name standard library which has to be included which makes us capable of DMA i.e. dynamic memory allocation. So let s try it once. Include the above hash include atd a i by a. First create an int ger pointer. Now we will assign this pointer. The memory given to us by malac. How much memory do we need from malac. So the size of the int ger is equal to 5 int gers and we typecast this pointer.If we give two int pointer then this is our pointer which is pointing here to 20 bytes of memory. Now if such a situation arises in which lock is assumed, let us write here F crore or any number bigger than crore, then a point will come when we will be asking for so much memory which our system does not have. Otherwise, when such a case comes when our system is not able to give us our required number of bytes, then in that case the return is NULL, so our PTR.The value of will become null when our system will not be able to give us the required number of bytes, that is why we have to write the correct number here thoughtfully, according to the capacity of our system. Now, if I have to store things inside this memory, like suppose I have got a memory of the size of five integers, now I have to actually store five integers inside it, then the method of storing it will be exactly the same as if we use arrays.Let s do what happens in arrays, we have fixed size memory. What we are doing here is that we are taking dynamic size memory, so we can use them also like arrays, just the size is not fixed here, it is such a simple thing like I store one at the required location, in first array I store three, then in PTR of two I store five, in PT of 3 I store seven and in PTR ofIf I store it in 4, then in this way I have stored some value in all the five integer locations and now I can run a loop. I can print all these values by applying a loop from i 0 to i 5i. P PTR of Aa is like we access the locations of the array and after that we store the values in it, then access those values and get them printed. The same process will remain whenever we will allocate memory from malloc and use a pointer. Let us run it once and see that then we have all the integers that I had stored in my memory. They have returned to me and if any operation has to be done with them.If you want to make changes, you can do so according to the memory that is allocated at our run time, not allocated at compile time, so in this way we have allocated the memory. Now let s talk about the next question of our practice question. Our question says write prog gram, I have written the WAP short form for this, to allocate memory to store five prices. Now the prices are generally the ones which are of our float type, so there are five floats.We have to store the prices of type in our memory, so how will we do it, the way to make it dynamic is that we will create a pointer which will be pointing to the memory allocated from mallac, five prices i.e. size of float and will type cast it to float pointer. Now we can store our prices inside the PTR. Whatever it is, all the things will be converted to our floating values. Let s save this also and run it once. This will be floating.Pointer and we want to print the percentage f, so all our floating values have been printed to us. We can take input from the user or can define our own and then perform different functions with them. Basically, whatever we could do with normal memory, we can do it with dynamic allocated memory. Now next let us understand our calc function.It means continuous allocation i.e. whatever memory you allocate with it will come in continuous fashion like if you allocate 20 bytes of memory then it will be allocated for you in continuous fashion and one more thing is to define the memory through calc and declare and allocate that every value is initialized with zero, suppose you have memory equal to five integers.So by default zero will be stored in all the integer values. If you take equal to five floats then by default 0.0.0 will be stored in it. So whenever you have to take memory dynamic and assign null values i.e. zero values in it then simply what to use is to use calc. The syntax to define it is that we simply write calc and like before we write bytes.This time we used to send, this time we will not send the total number of bytes. This time we will send how many locations we need. Number of locations and what is the size of para location. So the para location size we need is equal to one integer and five int eras we need the location. What we used to do earlier was to sell the total number of bytes. So we would multiply both of them. This time we will not do that. This time we have to send different parameters and then it will also return us void pointer void pointer.Type cast to integer pointer and now with the help of this PTR we can access the memory and assign values in it. We can print its values. Let s write the code once and see. For the first time, we will change the memory we have allocated in Calc. Now we will not assign anything in Calc, meaning we will not write one, we will write three, we will not do all these assignments and we will simply see what will be printed. For us, we have to pass it here.Two parameters will be one, our total number of slots do we need, one will be what will be the size of each block, so for every value we get 0.0 whereas if we do this memory with malloc and then try to run it, now here in this case our malloc has also printed 0.0 but it is not necessary, meaning it does not give any guarantee that our program will print only 0.0 every time. It is possible that there may be something in those blocks of memories.Get a random number printed for you, the clerk in your system will never guarantee that only 0.0 will come, in some cases it may come, in some cases it may not come, but if you want to make the initialization easier from the row, then always use Calc because it can take a guarantee for you. Now let s talk next. This is the question of our practice question. Our question is something like this, write a program to allocate memory of size n. This is n size of memory that we have to allocate. Where n is entered by the user. Now what is meant by saying n size is that n is multiplied by size of int. Here we will be taking that we have to allocate memory of n integers. So let s see this also. First of all, we will create an integer pointer ptr and an integer n.Now we will take our integer n input from the user. Enter n Next what will we do. Now we have to allocate this n size of memory. So pt01 n till i end every time we will be printing the percentage d ptr of aa. So we need memory of four sizes. So these four integers have been allocated to us and by default zero is stored inside each integer. Next let us see that free is also a most important function.Now what happens inside them is that the dynamic memory allocated by Calc Mall is not automatically free. Let us understand this thing in a little depth. We wrote a program inside it, we created an integer n and apart from that we used n in between and then later on that means this is a very long program. It has thousands of lines and the integer n is used only in the first line and in the second line. So the compiler of C is smart, it will see what it will do later.If it is not being used, then it will free n because it has seen that n is statically allocated, that is, the memory was allocated in the beginning itself and it knows that the C compiler knows what is going to happen with this memory. It has seen that no one is disturbing this memory, so it frees this memory after the second line so that the program does not hold up the unnecessary resources.Dynamically, the C compiler does not know anything about the memory you allocate, so what happens in that case, if you allocate any memory through malloc or calc, then the C compiler does not know whether anyone is accessing that memory in the code, whether any changes are going to be made in it or not, that is why it keeps that memory as it is, then the responsibility here falls on the programmer that our work is done.Then free that memory. If we are not using that memory, then we can free it in the middle of the program that now we do not use this variable. You free this memory and to free it, we use function free, so we use it to free memory that is allocated using malloc and calc and it has a very simple format. It has a very simple syntax to write it, we will just write free and put inside the pointer, this is that pointer.Which is pointing to the memory which we have to free, then let s write a small program for this too. We have just allocated n integers from Calc and at the end of the program, we will free this memory, then we will free the memory which PTR was pointing to and again what will we do with PTR, we will point it towards some other memory, like if we want to write the same statement again, now instead of integer n, there will be memory of only two integers.And we will get that also printed. What we did inside this code is that first we took a memory of n size, the pointer is pointing to that size, we printed whatever values were there and then freed that memory. Now we are giving access to the same pointer on the memory of two sizes and then now we are getting its values printed. So first we want to take the memory of four integers, then these four integers got printed for us, then we freed the memory, now we have it.If there is memory of total two integers, then zero will be printed, so I hope that we are able to see the benefit here that if there are integer pointers then we are usually not able to make any changes in it, but with dynamic allocated memory, we are able to free it in the middle of the code, we are able to allocate it. Next let s ask a question, the question is, free the memory allocated with calc, so we have freed this memory. Already, we ask this question.Done, let s talk next about Reloc Reloc means reallocation of memory i.e. re allocating a memory, like we just saw in the example that there were 30 children in your class, the roll numbers of 30 children. You have reserved the memory for storing which is equal to 30 malla by size of int. Now three more new children come in your class. Three more new children come, then you will have to add extra whatever is the size of three more new children. Inside that memory, you can add some more memory in the same chunk of memory, due to which what will happen is that while using the same pointer, you will also keep adding extra information inside your code, so relocate it i.e.You can also increase the memory. You can also decrease the memory. You can also increase the memory by using the same pointer and size. You can also decrease the memory. Why would you reduce it? In which case would you reduce it? When we took a lot of memory in the beginning and in the middle of the program we came to know that we do not need so much memory. For example, suppose you are running a college for which you have created a system online. You feel that you have launched a digital marketing course and 1000 children have enrolled in it.If you are going to do this, then you have allocated the memory according to the information of thousand children, but if only 70 children came to the event pass, then there is a lot of memory which will be wasted, so what will we do with the rest of the memory in the middle of the code, we will reallocate it. If we keep 70 keys, then this difference will be completely cleared for free. In reallocate, we will remove as much unnecessary memory as we have to remove and we will keep as much as we need, so the syntax of writing it is this.First we write reloc, then we put the pointer whose memory is to be reallocated and after that the new size, what is going to be the new size of the memory and from that we will assign it back to our pointer. So the question in this is Allocate memory for five numbers then dynamically increase it to store at numbers. How will we write the code for this? First of all we will create an integer pointer PTR. Now what is PTR doing? Initially it stores the memory equal to five numbers.In fact, let s use only Calc because I like initialization, so inside Calc we have to store memory equal to the number five, so the second size of Vint, now we have written PTR of 0, we have written one PTR of 1, we have written 2 and PTR of 3, we have written t. Now in the middle of the code, if we want to increase two more sizes, then what will we do, simply PTR is equal to reallocate, inside this we will first pass PTR andAfter that, we are going to have our new size, the new size is 8, so the memory which could hold the first five numbers, can now hold eight numbers. In fact, for this we write the code that these are the numbers, we will make the user enter all these, we will print F, enter numbers, how many numbers to enter, in the beginning, to enter five numbers, we make a loop from i to five, from zero to five and scan our numbers in each one, percentage, d andPTR of I Now as soon as this memory becomes eight, then after that we will have to scan again for the numbers and now we have to enter eight numbers and once entered, now we will print these numbers, so for that also we write a loop, we will use the same loop again, print F to the number, percentage D is first, so let s save and run. If we have to enter five numbers in the beginning, then we will enter 5 4 3 2 End.One, now we have to enter eight numbers, so 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and 1, so these numbers have been printed for us, number zero is eight, number one is seven, number two is six, number three is five, so this formatting is a little bit bad, let s fix it a little with back slash and in the beginning, we entered five numbers and now we have to enter eight numbers, so all these eight numbers are in our eight memory locations.Next, let s talk about this question Create an array of size five using calc and enter its values from the user, that is, we have to allocate a size equal to five integers from a calc and then get the user to input the values of those five integers. So, already a lot of the work has been done, first we created an integer pointer and then entered five size integers in it.The memory that has been allocated has been input to five integers and in fact now we have got them output as well, so if we write five here then our numbers will come to us, let s run it and enter five numbers 1 3 5 7 9 then the numbers will be printed and come to us next. The question is, allocate memory to store the first five odd numbers and then allocate memory to store the first six even numbers, that is, we have to take memory to store the first five odd numbers, out of which five we will have 1 3 5 7 and nine stored. After that, this memory has to be reallocated, that is, it has to be used again. First of all, it has to be made of six sizes because we will store six numbers in it, after that the first six even numbers will be stored in it.If we want to store the values of numbers, then this will be our interesting code. First of all, we create an integer pointer in ptr ptr. If we are storing five variables in memory com equal to five integers, then we will write int star and then initialize it with call. We will first pass five, after that we will store the size of int in ptr of zero. We will store one in ptr ofv. We will store three andSimilarly t th and then and here we will be storing our odd numbers so here sen has come and here f has come now we can also print this for int aa 0 i 5i print f statement percentage d b a ptr of 0 and in fact ptr of i So these are the starting five odd numbers we have stored and then got them printed. Now what will we do, we will reallocate this memory to reallocate the memory.We will write PTR equal to relc, we will put our old pointer inside relc and along with it the new size will be the new size. We will have six and now in the same location we will print even numbers and PTR of 5 12 and the same values. We will print this code. Save this code once and run it. So first of all we have even numbers printed on the screen. Then all the odd numbers are printed. What is the special thing to see?Found that the size i.e. PTR of five which we were not able to access earlier, we are able to access it in the same code. This thing which is increasing or decreasing in size, we cannot see it with Erus, we can see it only with Dynamic Daily Allocated Memory. So when such a situation arises that we have to allocate memory dynamically, then in those situations we will have to use Re allocate and which memory.We can dynamically allocate, we can reallocate the memory which was defined by malacc or calc and at the end we can free this memory by using free PTR. Now many people have worked hard to make this course, a lot of day and night, everything has been recorded, so I hope that all the chapters, the theory part of them, their notes or whatever extra things have been mentioned inside the video are related to the editor.Related to the topic, you all must have listened carefully and made notes of it and I hope that if you are going to have any interview or any college test, then all these things are helping you in that. Now after finishing this course, I have tried my best to make it in such a way that all the basic concepts are clear for you and in fact you have learned it once, otherwise you can go to any language and learn the syntax of yourThat language will be covered within a week because all the basic topics that we have learned are similar to the other languages, what happens is that their syntax changes, so now you will not face any problem in learning the concepts of new languages. Now once we have learned C, the next step is usually that people learn a new programming language. After this, because there is a slight change in C.The missing thing is that if there are no concepts of object orientation in it, then we cannot create classes and objects here. They are similar to structures but we cannot create them, that is why we shift to languages like C P or Java in which we can go and create classes or objects. Now a complete course of C P is already made according to the placement and a complete course of Java is also made according to the placement in which there is a lot of information.Advanced topics have been covered i.e. from the very basic to installation of editor to how variables are there in C PS, from how variables are there in Java to the very end like data structures and algorithms, the topics have been covered in those playlists. By going to T, we can explore whatever language we want to move ahead in. Now usually there is a myth that after C, you should learn mostly C P, after C, you should also learn Java, C P, learn JavaScript, it will not make any difference, programming concepts will be same for you and if you liked this video, if there is any topic in it which you feel you will remember for a long time and which is very interesting.If you have learned something, you can tell me about it by commenting below. The more you comment, the more I will know how valuable this course has been and for which students it has been valuable so that I can post similar videos, similar topics of study or different things in different languages. That s all for today, till then keep learning and keep practicing.
