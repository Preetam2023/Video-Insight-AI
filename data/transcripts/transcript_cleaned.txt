Hi everyone and welcome to the complete python s in which today is our chapter eight in which we will cover about object oriented programming using python3, what is the meaning of all these things, we are going to cover them inside this chapter, we will talk about different different concepts which will be making us better as a programmer, then as usual we will get the link in the description box below, so let s start with our chapter eight. Hi everyone.And now we are going to start with our Chapter Eight in which we will read about Objects and Classes i.e. Object Oriented Programming and its different fundamentals and in fact Object Oriented Programming is one of the most important topics of any programming language because questions related to it are asked a lot in interviews. In fact, there are many theses and many practical concepts which we are using inside the companies.Are to actually build systems, many of those concepts come out of object oriented programming. Maybe today we are going to teach our programming for the first time and many new things about pythonw.exe programming. Now first of all let s talk about what is meant by object oriented programming. Basically to map with real world scenario. We started using objects in code. What happened in the beginning. In the beginning we used to do procedural programming. To say procedural.It means that all the code was written sequentially. For example, I have written one of my variables is a 10. My second variable is let me zoom in b 20. I have made some sum. Sum is equal to this a plus this b then I am trying to print my sum a plus or directly write my sum variable. After that I have to calculate some difference. For the difference I am going to write a b and end.After that, I printed my difference, what did I do in this way, a lot of code, although I wrote it simply and showed it to you, but we are imagining it like a lot of code, which we kept writing one after the other, now then we learned the concept of functions, that is, in the beginning, there were many classes, inside that, we were writing the code in the same way, normally in a sequence, first one line, then the second line, then the third line, then the fourth line and and we know one.Our entire code will be executed in sequence. This is what we call procedural programming. After that came the concept of functions. Functions taught us how we can bring reusability. To reduce the redundancy inside the code and to bring reusability, let me write these words. Due to functions, redundancy decreases and what is reusability code?It means that if some things are repeated then combine them and make a single function, then what happened due to that, the redundancy decreased, the reusability increased, now we have made it a piece of code, by calling the function, we can use it again and again and again and again, that is why function is really important, so basically we have moved from procedural to functional programming, which is better.Now there is another level up method from the function which we call Object Oriented Programming which we are going to learn in this chapter. Basically we know that we can create functions but it is more important to increase the reusability to decrease the redundancy. To increase the reusability, we can also use objects and classes. Now like using the function inside the code is not compulsory for us.Merge is, if we feel that there is a piece of code which I should make a function, then we make it a function. We do not make everything a function. Similarly, if ever inside any code we feel that we have to use classes and objects, then we use object orientation there, then it is completely up to us. We are studying important concepts, but using these concepts is not compulsory, but yes, interview.From the point of view and practical programming point of view, we should know all the concepts if we want to become a good developer. If we want to become a good programmer, then in the real world we have to understand the objective. You must have heard both the terms object and class. What do we call an object? In the real world, we can call any thing an object. This, this mouse is an object, this keyboard has become an object, this pencil is going to be an object, everything is an object, so here also the meaning is the same, that is, any thing can be made an object, but before creating an object, we create a class of that object. We do not create objects directly inside object oriented programming. Before creating the object, the class of the object is created.Class is basically a blueprint. If we study both these terms in detail, then first we create a class like there was a class inside our school, then we start placing each student inside it, this is our each student. This is an object, this is an object, this is an object, this is an object. So in this way, we will go through all our things while imagining that the concepts which are used inside programming in the real world.How can we combine them to solve real world problems? And in fact, the very interesting thing is that python2 has already dealt with a lot of objects and classes. Inside Python, lists are lists, which are strings, strings are objects. And by the end of this chapter, we will gradually realize what these two terms mean and how we were already using them.Also, our chapter of object orientation is a little bit of theory but we will be understanding it in a very easy way with a lot of different examples. Now first of all, inside object orientation, we are going to talk about what is the exact meaning of class and object. First of all, let s talk about class. Class is a blueprint for creating objects. Like a blueprint is there, let s say a car has set up its own factory. Now what is the meaning of the car?There is a line in which cars will be produced, like if it is inside a college, then what is the information for the student that we will have to save in our system, the name of the student will also have to be saved, his address will also have to be saved, his roll number will also have to be saved, how much information is there, so whatever information we have to save, for any particular object, we are writing it inside a class and we will save the same.Blueprint is called for an object, for example, we have to create a system for our college. Now the college tells us that we have to store the information of many students. One way is to store the information of many students in the form of a list, like for example, this is my list. Inside the list, first store the name of the student, this is the student s name, after that, store their marks, anything we can do.After that, we can store different relevant information. We can do it from the list also, we can do it from the dictionary too. There are many different ways but the most practical way would be to use the concept of a class and object. How, first of all, we will define the blueprint, that is, we will define it by writing a class. If we want to store the class for the student, then to define the class, we write the class keyword and after that we write the name of our class, the name of the class, something.It can also be like the name of the variable is end, generally the name of our class, we always start it with a capital letter, so we have created a class with the name Student and now inside it we are telling what information should be stored for the student, so inside our code, let s try to create a class, we are creating a class Student and inside the Student class, let s suppose I just have to save the name for now.I want to give the same name to all the students, what have I given to all of them? I have given the same name, it means that whoever becomes a student inside a student class, his name will always be the same name. Now what can we do, I have made a student but we do not use the classes directly. Then we have to create an object of the class. We can imagine it in the same way as we have a class inside our school, but inside that class will be the only class. This will not be beneficial, when the students are sitting inside the class, they are actual students, they have the advantage, so here we create the objects using the blueprint of that class, just like we made the blueprint inside the factory that a car should have this feature but then the actual car will also have to be made, the actual car which is made using that blueprint is called an object, so to create the object, we write our object.The name of the variable is equal to then the name of the class and then the parenthesis, so in this way we can create a new object, which are our objects, we call them instances, inside programming, instances or instances of class, so whenever we hear instance, whenever we hear object, we are basically talking about the same thing, so here if I want to create student s1, then to create it we can write equal toTo Student which is the name of my class, I have to write it exactly here and then we will put our pencils and after that if we want, we can print our student. Let s try to print s1. As soon as we execute it, what is printed for s1. What is printed for s1 is the main dot student object at this location. Basically, we have got a little idea of what this is. This is an object which is created in our code.Inside and what is its type, this is the object of student class which has been created for us. If we want, we can also print the name inside the code. Now this is the name because it was inside the blueprint. Inside the blueprint, if we have once defined that the color of every vehicle should be blue, then all the vehicles coming will be of blue color. So in the same way, in the blueprint, if we have defined that the name of my student should be Karan every time, then as soon as we define the name of s1,Similarly for me we will write Karan aak will be printed which is going to be the name same for every student similarly if I create another student s2 student and we will print s2n then the same thing will be printed here also we will have the same value coming for both the students. Now we will learn how to change this value but for now we have seen that in the basic way if we have to create a class.So we can create something like this and if we want to create an object then we can create something like this This is a class and this is an object Let s take another example for example we are creating a factory inside which we are going to produce cars so we can create a class Let s call it Car that s how each car should look Basically inside each car we want to color all the cars that we have, Blue Mary.The color of all the cars is going to be blue. Now we can create our cars. This is my car one. Car one is equal to two. What we have done is that we have created an object of car and now we can print it. We have saved the color of car one and run it. The color of car one is equal to blue. In the same way, we can also give it parameters. For example, every car will have some model or some brand. Let s assume that the factory we have created is brand.It is said that this function is invoked at the time of object creation. To be invoked means it is executed. Whenever a new object is created, like for example, when I created car one, what happened is that one constructor was automatically executed. If yesterday I created car two, then again my constructor function, this function, will be executed. Now the interesting thing is this.Here we don t see it function so what do we do for now let s comment it out once Let s come to our simple example student example here our class is student so we can create a constructor for student all classes have a function called in it function which is always executed when the class is being initiated or in fact hereIt should be called when the object is being initiated. Right now inside our class here we have not written any inet function, so what does Python do? It automatically creates an it function for us and will definitely execute it. Whether you as a programmer write this function or not, this function will always execute there. Let s always be a constructor for us. Now if we have to write the constructor ourselves, then how can we write that it function? We will basically write our function inside the class, first we will write def, after that, under the underscore, we will write in it, that is, the short of initialization is short in it and again under the underscore which is also suggesting by VS code, this is my it function and for this, let s put a pencil and this is it.Inside the function, now we can do any work like for example, inside this if I want to print creating new student or for practical, let s write here adding new student in database. In this way we write something like what we are doing, we are adding the value of new student inside our college database. We have written this basically. Let s keep this name above for now, so now we will notice that as soon as we open our s1 objectSimilarly, what will happen first of all, similarly, first of all, this function will be called automatically. Basically, when we write the name of the class and here these parameters which we are putting, these parameters are used to call the constructor, then automatically this constructor will be called. Well, another interesting thing about the constructor is that the constructor always takes an argument or we can say it takes a parameter. Which is called the self parameter means in this way.If we define our constructor, then the first parameter will always be a self parameter, so here we have to write along with self. Now what is the meaning of self? Self means the new object which is being created, that is, this s1 object which we are creating a new object, we are calling it self, i.e. I myself, this is the object on which the constructor is called on its creation, this is the reference to it, that is, it is pointing towards this.So once we save it and run it, it is true that we did not print anything. So what did I write? I created a class, it had some name and there was a constructor. I have just written this in my code Let me delete all of this. Only this line is written inside the code, still what happened is that this thing will be printed automatically. Adding new student in database. Why because of this constructor, it gets invoked automatically and gets called automatically.Okay, now let s see what is this self, if we want, we can print our self, let s save it and run it, so what is printed is the student object at this location, so basically this is the student object that we are creating, this is the self variable that we have taken, both the things are the same, it is pointing to the same, in fact if I get it printed here, s1, let s save it and run, then what are these two things, this is this location.And this thing they are both the same thing, this is the object of s1 which we have simply named s1, internally self means the same that we are talking about this s1 object and now if we want to give different names to different students, then inside the constructor we can also take multiple parameters like one is our self parameter, self is always the first parameter, after that if we want, we can take any variable named full name and here becauseThis is the constructor in a way, here we can pass our name, so let s suppose first, we want to name the student as Karan, now we will not name every student as Karan, so here what we can do is we can do self dot name is equal to full name, so basically what happened here, whatever value we pass from here, it will come inside the full name and inside self, basically s1.The value of name inside student student, a new variable will be created inside it, inside the class inside which the value of full name will be assigned, then when we name s1, its value will be printed. We will have Karan, let s save it and run it. So, what is the name of s1, Karan has come. I hope we have understood the process of what we did inside the object when we created an object, created a constructor, if we do not create it ourselves.So Python does it automatically for us and inside the constructor we always have to pass an argument which is my self argument. If we do not write this self here then our So an error will come. Well, this parameter of ours is self. It is not necessary that we call it self. If I want to call it a b c d and here I write a b c d, then basically I am saying that I am giving a name to my object, this is an alias that I want to call my object a b c d. This code is also completely valid and there will be no error in it, but because generally all the programmers areThey are writing selfie here because if you will work on someone else s code also, when you go inside the company, there should not be any confusion that what is exactly the reference here, that is why what will we write in general, do we always have to try to write self here in some other way, we do not have to create the name by ourselves, so what is self, self is the reference, infact here I have also written, the self parameter is.A reference to the current instance of the class i.e. the object we are creating right now. If we create a new object, then we will talk about it, then if we create someone else, then we will talk about him. And it is used to access the variable that belongs to the class, i.e. inside the class, we can access the variable using self or we can create a new variable like this name, what did we do, now just like this weWe can create second student s2 e to student, we name it Arjun and then what will we do, we will print the name of s2, exactly the same work is going to be done for it, the same work is going to be done here, let s save it, let s run it, what was printed? First of all, the constructor was called for Karan, so he got this printed, then we got the name of s1 printed, then the second constructor was called, here the constructor is called once with every new object.When a call is made, that thing gets printed here, then we get the name of s2 printed, then the name of s2 gets printed and comes to us, so this is how our constructor works and this is how our self parameter works, with the help of self parameter, we can store different different variables or different different data. Well, whatever data we store for the object, like we stored the name for s1 or we stored the name for all the students, we store all these.Whatever data is stored, we call all this data as variables, that is, the data that is stored inside the class and inside the object or we can call them variables. We call them variables inside the programming and can also send multiple values, like we can send our marks along with the full name. Well, it is not necessary to call it full name here, if we want, we can also call it simply name.This is called name, this is called name, so here when we are saying name, when we are writing name, name means the name which has come in the parameter and here self dot name means which is going to be created new inside the object, similarly, self, marks, equal marks, this is generally the syntax which we will see at many places, that is why I am giving the same name. Generally, what do programmers do, this value and this value, both are given the same name.If we give marks then we also get into the habit of the same, so now we can start sending the marks of the students also. Let s suppose they scored 97 and they scored 88. So now if we want, we can start sending s2.Along with the name, we can also print the s2 marks and here we can print the s1 marks. Let s save it and run, so these are the names and marks of our s1. These are the names and marks of our s2. So in this way we create our classes, inside that we can create a constructor. Inside the constructor, when a new object is being created, we can also pass additional information so that that additional information is included with our object.Let it be stored and tomorrow we can access that information from the same object and use it for some other purpose. So this is how the concept of object orientation works. We could have stored the same data inside the string also. This is the same data of student and marks. We could have stored it inside the list also. We could have stored it inside the dictionary also. It is not at all compulsory to use classes and objects. But many times such real life scenarios will arise when we will have to use classes and objects, but what we are doing right now is that we are trying to understand this entire concept with a simple example so that when we have all the knowledge available, also those who are our constructors also have theorets, so one is done, this is the constructor and let s make another version of the same. Let s suppose I have this additional constructor, so this one is the first one.The one is such a constructor which has only one variable inside it, the only parameter is which is my self parameter, so generally we call such constructors as default constructors, we call them default constructors, if we do not create the default constructor, then by default it will make them Python, meaning inside it, definitely this thing will not be printed, that is, if I write a pass here or get something printed, then it will come in the category of default constructor.And secondly we have parameterized constructors. Constructors parameterized constructors means that constructor inside which there are some other parameters besides self, then it comes in the category of our parameterized constructor and it comes in the category of our default constructor and if we write two constructors inside the same class, for example, if we have called in this way, then which constructor will we execute?That constructor is executed, which is matching with your parameters. Now this one which is the default constructor, our parameters are not matching with it, so obviously this one function will run, this one function will run and generally for a single class, we do not create multiple constructors as true, what we do is we see our need and accordingly we are defining only one single constructor, so this isWas all about constructors? Now we are going to read about attrile. We have two types of attriles. Already we have seen what is the meaning of attrile. It means any data i.e. any variable like name, these are marks.Which means for the entire class, which is owned by the class and is common for all the objects and there is one instance attribute which is different according to each object. For example, we have created a class with the name Student, now for Student, first Student One will come, Student Two will come Student Three, Student Four will come. If I have a class called Student, then let s suppose this is my Student One, this is myStudent Two This is my student Three This is my student Four Can I say that the name will be different for every student, its name can be different from the name of s2, its name can also be different, its name can also be different, it is not that we will define the name once and all the students will have the same name, this will not happen, then the name will be different for all the student objects or student instances.Logically, if the name of each student object will be different, then can I say that this name should be an object or instance attrile, that is, it should be a data which should be different for each object, then such data which is different for each object, we define it by self dot, like we know that the name of each student will be different, the marks of each student will be different, so we will write self dot, if we write self dot marks, then it means to say self dot name.That each object s name will be different self dot marks means to say self here what is self here pe is a reference to the object means we are defining marks for the object we are defining the name for the object here so this name self dot name self dot marks what are these two these two instance attributes will be different for one object second thing can I say if we have a student with class name then this student this student thisStudent and Student If we are creating the database of the same college and are working on some systems of the same college, then can I say that the name of that college will be same, meaning this student. This is also studying within the same college This is also studying within the same college This is also within the same college So the name of the college will be the same for everyone So should I store the name of the college separately here Should I store the name of the college separately here Name of the college here Name of the college here Does it make sense That doesn t make sense at all Because what do objects do? Objects occupy space in their memory. Coupa space in the memory when this object is created.For example, this is an object, we have defined a name for it, Karan, we have defined a name for it, Arjun, we have defined a name for it, Tony, we have defined a name for it, Bruce, so this is also separately from Space Occupied to Space Occupied, this is also separately from Space Occupied to Space Occupied, inside the memory. If I have to store the same data for Space Occupied, then can I store it four different times or if I want to store it tomorrow?If I have to create 1000 objects, should I store the same variable, the same thing, the same object 1000 times? Not at all, that is why we make the thing that is common, a class object and store it in the memory only once at a time. How, if the college name is the same for every student, then I cannot define the college name as self dot something inside the constructor.I will give that my college name is ABC College, then the college name will be the same for every student, if I want, I can also print the college name like in the last I can print s2 dot college name, let s save it and run, then for s2, the name of his college is printed and this variable is college name because it is not defined with itself, hence it is stored only once in the memory, even if you create 10 objects.This will be stored only once in the memory but because the name is different for each object, it will be stored in the memory 10 times because there are different values. If the marks to be stored are different, then the marks are also different and will be stored differently. So the things which are common for all the objects, we make them a class attribute and to access the class attribute, we can also simply write class dot attribute like here instead of writing s2 d college name, IThe student could directly write the name of her class dot college name, this is also completely valid, the same value comes to us in print, but if I have to access this name, then for that we access it in this way, s2n or s1 n. Well, here some students may have another doubt in their mind, who is coming for example, I have this one student s1, let s try this for our example.Inside the Student class, we have given the class attribute that what is the name of the student, in the class attribute I wrote Anonymous and in the object attribute I passed Karan when I will print it here s1.Name, so what should be printed? You can pause here and think and try to guess. Well, it is not a thing to guess. When I run it, I will have the current printed. Why will it be printed? Because whenever I have a class attribute of the same name, what is this, this is a class attribute of the same name, when we have a class atrio and of the same name, when we have the president of the object attribute, that is the class attribute.It is higher than means if it has the same name then always the object will get preference, it will get higher priority, but generally we do not do this, generally we do not keep the object attribute and class attribute as same, that is generally taken in that case, let s assume that if an object has not given its name, if a student has not given its name, then its name will be anonymous by default, that is basically one of the purposes, why you wouldUse it but in this case it is not making a lot of sense but it is important to remember that whenever the object is the same value of the class as the object, always the object is given higher priority in the usage. Next we are going to talk about methods. Now whatever is our class, two things can be stored inside the class, one is data and one is some methods. Data means attribute.Is a class basically a collection of two things? What properties do you have? What are the properties of methods? What all can you do, like if there is a car, I have to make a blueprint of the car, then first of all I will tell you what is the mileage of the car, what is the color of the car, how many CC is the engine of the car or what is the basic tire size of the car. In this way, different things will be explained, all these are the basics of how the car runs, how does the car start, how does the car stop, how does the engine start, whatever are our functions, we call them methods.If we say that methods are basically functions that belong to objects, when we have written any functions inside the class, we call the functions as methods. The functions which are written inside the class, we call them methods, so till now we have read about string methods or we have read about list methods or let s suppose any dictionary method, then how are the methods for all these?Methods for all these came because all these were classes in which we used to create objects and then we were using methods for objects, so let s assume that we have created a class, here we have defined a constructor for the class and in this way we can define our method, we can write def, inside that we can write the name of our method, we can call ourselves and inside the class we write methods.Inside that, we always write our self parameter as the first parameter and then it is our wish, we can use it if we want, if we don t want, we can not use it, in this way we can define our methods and to use, we write our name dot, the name of our method, in this way we can execute for example let me remove this print line, for example we can create a method that says hello, if I have said thisCreated some method which simply says hello or which says welcome student and in fact we call this method welcome student for now it is just saying welcome student let s save it so here to call welcome student we can write s1 welcome and we can call this method ok when we call this method we will have errorIt will come that Welcome takes zero positional argument but one was given that we are not passing any argument. Basically here inside Welcome, we have to write self first i.e. we always write self parameter first. Let s save it and run. Now, Welcome Student came and got printed for us, whether we are using self inside or not, inside every method we are generally writing self. NowUsing self we can also access its properties like I can type self dot name so welcome student and then the name of the student will be printed for us let s save it and run so this is what happened our entire method is executed in the same way we can create a method def get marks this self has come we can print or what this function does is this function returns self dot marks selfDot is returning the marks, so here we can print s1 dot get marks and execute it, then whatever value is returned will be printed for us. Minimize it a bit and when we run it, the marks will be printed for us. In this student s method, we can create our own different methods. python pip will automatically create the constructor for us. If we want our own constructor, Constructor.Basically, it is for initialization of the object, that is, if while creating the object, if you want to do some work, like if we want to create some new variable, then we do that work inside the constructor. In this way, we define our constructor. There are two types of constructors, default and parameterized. Always inside the constructor, first which is our parameter, that is the self parameter which means the object instance and after that we can take different parameters.We can create our own metrics. There are two types of attributes, one is class attribute and one is object attribute. Apart from that, inside the class we create our methods. The functions inside the class are called methods. Inside the methods, we are always writing ourselves. These are the methods. These are the functions of our class, like this became my first method, in the same way, we could have created a student object s2, for that we could have called our method again, so we have covered the basic basic important things about classes and objects, so once we solve a practice question, then the question is telling us to create student class thatTake name and marks of three subjects, so what can we do, we can create a class, we will call it Student, inside it, basically, we will create a constructor, then we will define our constructor under and inside it, first of all, self will come, after that we are being told that we have to pass the name and then we have to pass the marks of three subjects, either we can pass three different variables, otherwise if we want, one.You can also pass the proper list. We will try the list method subjects as argument in the constructor then create a method to print the average of all the subjects. So, we are going to do all these things. Let s clear our screen. First of all, let s create a class with the name Student. Let s create a constructor inside the student class. Def in it. Inside this, we will have self. We are going to have our name and we will have marks.They are I am going to assume marks is a list meaning when marks are passed then they will be coming to us in this way 99 998 97 Marks will be coming to us in this way so here we can define self dot name e equal to this name and self dot marks equal to marks let us also see by creating a student object s1 e equal to student and pass values inside it.So first we can pass the name of the student let s call him Tony Stark and then we will pass the marks 99 98 997 in this way so let s save it. Now the second part is asking us to create a method to print the average so inside this we are going to define let s call it get average. Self will come inside this. Apart from self we do not need to take anything else for the average.Here first of all we will calculate the sum The sum is going to be self dot marks or we can run a loop To get the sum of self we can run a loop Initially sum is equal to 0 for value in marks I can do all the values in my marks and then print high Let s print the name first high dot name your score is or your average score is sum divided by 3 Here also it is selfIf we do dot marks then basically get average. We have created a method. Self will come inside the method. Before the sum, we have done all the self dot marks. We calculated the sum of all the values of this list and then got the average printed. Let s save it and call s1 dot get average. Saved it and ran it. High Tony Stark, your average score is 98.3. What happened? Calculate the average score for me.This is also an additional option which has come to our attribute this name is my attribute. I have to go and change this name also. If let s suppose I want to change the name of s1 and then if I call s1 average marks then I can change my attribute also. Let s save it and run it. So what happened now, my name is getting printed differently here, so they have to change their attribute in this way.Manipulating is also possible inside classes and objects. The next concept we will talk about is that is going to be static methods. Till now we have seen the methods like our get average method, it has become some other method, all these are non static methods i.e. normal methods. Now we are going to talk about a special type of method which is called static.Methods are static methods are methods that do not use the self parameter, till now we have seen that inside every method, we have our self parameter or we always have to write it, but if we do not want to use self, for example, if I have to create a function called hello and inside that I just want to print hello, if we wrote something like this and then we tried to use it, if I try to write s1.Hello this will give me an error Run Kiya I will get an error Why am I getting an error Because by default there should be self inside hello which we did not write but there is no sense of self inside this function. If S is not created then we can make it a static method, we can change this method to a special category, so our static methods do not have self parameter inside them and they work at class level, meaning they do not work at the object level, so whenever we create a class, let s assume this is our class, this is our object one, this is my object, this is my object, this is my object, which is self, it is used for objects.Yes, here self means object one, here self means object two, here self means object three, but if you are creating a method which does not require an object, like to print hello, we are not using any attribute or anything else of the object, then what to do with it, not at the object level, now bring it to the class level, that is why the methods which are there at the class level, we call them static methods.To create methods, we write rate static method, this is a decorator, we will also talk about what is decorator, basically by writing decorator, we are telling that we want to create a static method, then we can create our normally static method, like here, to remove the error inside this hello, I have to simply write rate static, it is also being suggested here, what is this.It converts a function to be a static method. This is a decorator which converts a normal function to be a static method. Now if I save it and run it, no error will come for us, it will simply print hello. So this is what we call a decorator in Python. Apart from this, there are other decorators too but decorators allow us to wrap another function in order toExtend the behavior of the wrap function without being permanently modified. If I explain in more simple language, basically there is a function which is a decorator which takes a function in the parameters and also returns a function in the output. So what does this decorator do? What does a decorator with a static method do? It takes this entire function, changes its behavior and gives it back. This is just the decorator, the rest of us will see the decorators further.If they are, then there is no need to take tension now, basically we have to write the rate static method to make any normal function static and this static method is a decorator which is changing the behavior of my normal function, so this was a normal function, just by changing its behavior it has been made a static method, so whenever we have such methods which have edge true inside them.If self is not needed then we can bring them to class level and for them we can use static method decorator. Next we are going to talk about two important concepts which I will call two pillars of Oops. Two pillars of object orientation. Basically whenever we read object orientation programming in any language, whether you already have C background or you have Java background.Is it a background or are we currently studying Python? There are generally four pillars of object orientation in every language. One pillar is abstraction. Meaning, these are the four threat definitions. It is difficult to remember their names. Their meaning is very easy. The more difficult it is, the more difficult it will be for you to remember abstraction as a word. Meaning, its meaning is very easy. There is nothing. Meaning, just remembering this word is the most difficult thing. Assume that it is just English and there is nothing else.Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism, these are the four pillars on which the entire object orientation stands. Out of these, we will discuss both of them in our next part. For now, we will just discuss abstraction and encapsulation. It is very easy. Abstractct means basically in English, it can be called hidden or something which is not clear like if you have heard the word abstract art, then abstraction means programming.Inside the sub, there is hidden mention of the details of a class, that is, how things are being implemented inside the class. Exactly, you have hidden that and you are showing only the important features to the user, that is, the unnecessary things which are not needed by the user, you have hidden them. For example, when a car moves, when an engine starts, what process is happening internally inside the engine?Will not know means unless And Antya, you don t search for it but it is true, when you press the clutch, when you press the accelerator, we know exactly what is happening inside the engine, what is happening with the fuel, how the combustion is working, all those things are not visible to us but they are happening internally, so what did the car owner do, what did the car manufacturer do, unnecessary things like what is happening inside the engine, its driver does not care about the truth.If you have to start the car, then hide the unnecessary details and show only the essential things. The essential things are visible to the user. This is the meaning of abstraction. For example, if I create a class dot car car, I created a class inside it. Let s suppose I create a function called start and what does this function do. When we start the car, then first of all we take self inside it and in fact we also create a constructor called def constructor.Let s write in it, self will come inside it and as soon as self comes, what will we do? We will create an accelerator inside every car. This is my accelerator or let s call it dot acc. We can create an accelerator inside every car. In the beginning, what is the accelerator, we can call it false or not pressed. Apart from that, there can be a brake inside every car. Well, brake is a keyword. We call it bir ke self dot bir.There is a brake inside every car, in the beginning we have not even pressed the brake and inside every car we may have a clutch. In the beginning we have not even pressed the clutch, so what we have done is that we have defined a car. Now as soon as we start the car, first of all we will press the clutch, so our self dot clutch value will first be equal to true, after that we will press the accelerator a little bit, so self dot x means don t take it.Literally, we are just taking an example here and then what will we do, when our car starts, we will get it printed, we have created a class called car started, made the car a normal class, initialized it, there is an accelerator, brake and clutch inside every car, all the falls are there in the beginning, none of them are pressed, what do we have to do when we have to start the car, then we have to press the clutch also, then we have to press the accelerator and our car will start.Let s create a car one object is equal to car inside which we don t have to pass anything and then what I want to do is I want to start my car let s save it and run it. Now as soon as I wrote my code to start the car, the car started, this thing got printed but in the background these were the unnecessary steps like true the clutch first, true the accelerator first, here I am not really understanding all these.Where are the steps? All these steps are inside the class, outside the class, so no unnecessary thing was printed, nor outside the class, I did not see anything which was being implemented internally, so it became edumanga and I had access to only the necessary things which I needed to start a car. This is called abstract. What we did was that we mentioned abstractions inside our code. This is what abstracts are called code.When you hide the unnecessary implementation details inside and show only the necessary things to the user, we are abstract. Second is encapsulation. Capsule is an important word inside this. Basically, we create a capsule. Let me try to create this capsule of data and related functions. We create a capsule of data and related functions in a single unit. What is this? This is my.Capsule and this is what we call encapsulation, basically we have created a class inside which there are variables inside which there are methods and we are using the same by creating an object, which is what we have been doing till now, inside this lecture, we have written the complete code, that was all encapsulation, whenever we are creating a class, there is Atridox inside it, its related data and related functions are also there and what is that capsule, that capsule is my object and in the sameWhen we call encapsulation, then abstract encapsulation are two difficult words in English but their meaning is very simple, till now we have written the code of classes and objects, this is abstract. Tractor is this encapsulation, there is nothing difficult to understand in it, but yes, the definition of both of them is very important because the interviewer can also ask you the definition or if you have any exam of Python in college, then the definition is really important in that too, we can remember it. Next now let s solve one more practice question. We have to create an account class with.Two accounts are called one account, basically we are talking about a bank account, there will be two accounts inside it, one will be our bank balance and one will be our account number, two accounts we have to create, after that we have to create methods by which we can debit any amount from the account, credit means debit means subtracting the value from the account, credit means adding something to the balance and then we will have one more method which prints theBalance, we are going to create all these things, so first of all we create a class for ourselves, inside the Account Account class, first of all, we define our own constructor, inside this we will have self, apart from that we will have balance, let s call it bill and after that we have account number, self dot balance is equal to this value and self dot account number is equal to this value, so if I have to create any account for.For example, this is my account one or for ACC and customer one, so we can set up our account, first of all we have to pass the balance, we can pass any number inside the balance, for example, we have an amount of 10000 which we have added inside our bank account and then our account number is let s assume 4 or let s assume 4 5 this is my account number, now we have it if we want.For our user, we can also print the balance for account one directly and if we want, we can also print the account number for him. So I have successfully created it. For debit credit and printing the balance, first of all we create our debit method. Inside def debit debit, we will have to use self because whenever the amount is debited, that means if you want to take anything from the bank account, then the value of the balance will decrease.And who will have the balance? Every object has a different balance. Every account has a different balance. The second account has a different balance. The third account has a different balance. So here the amount will decrease from the balance. Let s assume this is the amount that we want to take out from our account. So first of all what will happen is from the first balance i.e. from self dot balance we will subtract this amount and then basically we can print Rupees Rs.The amount was debited or from your account, it is okay, it is given, so this is our debit method and our credit method is going to be like this, this is my credit method, inside this we are going to add some amount, okay this will be minus equal to two, this will be plus equal to two, we have added this amount inside our balance and here we will write credited basically added.This is the amount and then we will create a function which returns the final balance get balance and basically what it does is it returns the self dot balance. If we want, here also we can call like we have printed debited, after that we can print the total balance is equal to and here we will call get or self dot get balance, the same thing can be done here, so our internal one is the same.The method was to call the same whenever any amount is debited or credited, we will get our final balance printed, so this is my account class, inside this is the balance and account number, then I have debited the amount, when I debited, it is removed from the balance, it is printed and it has come, and if it has been credited, it has been added to the balance, it has been printed, and the final total balance has come, and we have already created the internal function of get balance, let sTry to do something, first of all let s suppose we want to debit the account, we want to take out 000 from it, after that what I want to do is we want to add 00, then what will happen first 000, when we debit, it will be printed here, 1000 was debited, how much is the total balance, 9000 is left, after that 500, we have credited the account. If you add it inside the ticket then the total balance becomes 49500. After that let s assume our salary comes at the start of the month. Let s suppose my salary is 40000. Saved it. So the amount which was 9500 became 40000. It becomes 49500. After that again I have to pay my rent. I might be spending about 10000.And the cycle repeats the total balance chain. So in this way we have created a class of our own and created objects inside it. This was a single account. In this way, multiple accounts can be created. In fact, there are many people who create starter projects like whenever we learn any first language, we learn Java, we learn python2, within the year also we learn the most basic project. Students create some banking system like this or some other system.Let s take those projects in which similar classes and objects are based on object orientation, those projects in which you create account class in the same way, your balance is getting updated, different different things are happening but this is basically a demo of how objects can relate to real world scenario, meaning all these things are fine, we could have created the function of debit, we could have created the function of credit separately, we could have also created the function of get balance but then for each account, its own.Storing the balance Storing the account number We have to use a list at some places We have to use a dictionary at some places We have to use something else Things get very confusing but in a real world scenario it makes perfect sense to use classes and objects in this case within this example otherwise we would have been stuck with a lot of different data types so this is how classes and objects help us logically.Organize Our Code in a Well Structured Manner So, these were all the basic things related to classes and objects which we have covered in this part one. There are many more concepts which we have just talked about like inheritance, like polymorphism, infact, how can we create a private entity, how can we create a private method, how do we delete an attribute, these small things.There are important things which we will cover in our part two, so that s all for today, till the next lecture, keep learning and keep practicing.
