Hi Everyone and Welcome to the Complete Python Series, in which today we are going to complete part two of our UPS i.e. Object Oriented Programming. In this part, there will be inheritance, polymorphism, we will cover the important concepts of this method, implement them and then solve practice questions based on them. Apart from this, if you want to read any topic of Python.So they are available in this playlist above this channel, so we can go and watch them, we will find the link to download And Like Always Notes in the description box below, from there we can access our slides, so let s start with our next lecture, so oops in the chapter, we are going to read the next concept like this is the del keyword del keyword is used to delete object properties or the entity itself any object.If we create an object inside the code, then what it does is that some space is occupied inside the memory because there are some methods related to the object, its many different attribute attributes take up space inside our memory, so many times it may happen that we have created an object which we never want to use later, then we can individually delete its properties and also delete that object.We will have to write this keyword simply DL and after that we can delete the properties in this way. By attribute we can also delete our complete object. Let s try to create a student object. If we have created student class inside it let s create our constructor in it. Inside this we will have a name and self dot name ect name and now what we have to do is we create a student one inside which name isI can pass Shraddha and if I want to delete the student I can simply write deal with and after that if we try to print the student then in that case we will get an error Let s save it and run So in this case we have an error because the name s1 is not defined why because it got deleted here whereas if we were printing the same thing here then no error would come.In that case, normally the thing which is already printed for us would get printed. If we are getting the name printed here and then later if we delete the name and then try to print it, then first it will be printed normally for us but after that because we have deleted that thing, it is showing here that student object has no eligible name. So in this way we can use our dl delete keyword.Next we are going to talk about private variables in general whenever we read oops , like in any language, whenever we read oops in c p, in Java, we have this concept of public and private. Generally, in other languages, if we make any variable or any method public, then it generally means that we call that method or that attribute as a class.Can also be accessed from outside like till now if I have created a student then in student I can write s1.n What am I doing from the scope of my class, that is, this is the scope of the class, wherever there are things inside the class, I can access the student s name outside the class, so we generally put it in the public category, but sometimes we have some such sensitive information, some are sensitive edible, there are some methods which we want to keep private, which we do not want to give access to anyone outside our class.Example if I create a class called Account for bank account or I am creating a class for account and for this account we store multiple information like here in it we have self we have the account number along with that we also have the password of the account so account number and password are two information we have self dot account number is equal to account number and self dot account password is equal to account password in this way we have done someThe information has been displayed, now let s assume that tomorrow a new user comes and he tries to create an account, then inside the account we will see multiple information. You can do let s suppose, in the beginning, when a user s account is created, then his account number is going to be 1 2 3 4 5 and his password is going to be A B C D E. In this way, this is the account number and this is the password. Now anyone wants that we want to print the account 1 account number. Now, although things are visible here in the code, but generally how does the flow work? Generally, if you go to any website, there is a user from there, that is his account.You will set the number or your password or enter it and after that it can be done inside the back end only through Python code. In this way, whatever information comes to us, we are saving it directly here inside the class. Now when we are printing the account number, what will happen to it, the account number will also be printed for us and the account password will also be printed here for us. When I try to print these things, both of them will be printed forMe but generally this is a bad practice because the account password is such a thing that maybe inside this code we should not pass it outside this account class because whatever is publicly available increases the chances of accidental changes inside it and decreases the security inside it. That is why whenever we implement something in the objects and classes inside the code in which we feel that any information is sensitive or we do not want to pass this information outside.If you do not want to pass it outside your class, then we can make it private in a way, that is, now it will not be possible to access that information outside the class and to make any article private, what we do is simply put two underscores in front of it, what we did is put two underscores and this thing now becomes private, so here if I try to access this thing i.e. account 1 Dr account password when we will now try to access it andIf we run this then in this case we will get the error Account object has no attribute account password so basically this thing has now become private, we cannot access it outside the class. Let s assume that we have a function to reset the password. All this imaginary stuff is going on. We have a function which resets the password. And inside that function, let s assume that we want to print account one dot password or this will be self dot account password.It is absolutely possible to do this thing, that is, here the self dot password will work but here the account and dot password will not work because where is this function, this function is inside the class and this print statement is outside the class, so outside the class we will not be able to access it but inside the class like if I try to call reset password, then this time we will not get any error, this time our password will simply be printed for us, so if there is anything that we canIf we want to keep it only inside the class, then we can make it private. Now this concept of private and public works like it works in other languages, it has become Java, it has become C , if you have a background in those languages, then it does not work exactly like that. oops pythonanywhere.com, we should put underscore underscore in front of the functions and also we should put underscore underscore in front of the methods. For example lets.Create Another Class We create a class from a normal one. Let s suppose this is a class called Person. Inside the Person class, we create a text inside which we are storing the name. Anonymous. In this way, we have created a class. Now p1 is equal to this new person which has been created for us. If we try to print the name of p1 here, then now we will get no error. Why is it coming because here we have used double underscore?If we run it, we will get an error here, so what is this thing? This thing has become conceptually private in a way. Similarly, we can also make the methods private. For example, if I define a method called Hello, which prints what, which prints, Hello user prints something in this way or Hello person prints something in this way, so now like a normal method, it is here.It is not possible to make a call, meaning if we think that we will write hello here in this way, then this thing is not possible in Python, what will happen inside it? Inside also we will get the error that Person object has no attribute called hello because here we have used underscore underscore. Now here as a beginner the question may come in our mind that why have we created such a function which we can never use with the object because there are functions of this type generally which want to use some other function internally. For example, here we have a function named Welcome.And let s create a function and this is a completely normal function, this is normal, this is our method and what it does is it will first print hello in this way and after that or what it passes inside hello, it passes its name. This is going to be self dot name in fact here also we make self and then our name value will come to us, then it will call the hello function and inside that we will pass self.That is, it will pass its name like this, let s say underscore underscore and what is this welcome function doing? This welcome function is calling hello, so if it wants, it can call complete hello. Here also we write self. Now we are telling the person that the person can say welcome but can never say hello. Welcome but can say hello because it is a method of internal class. So this is the way things work, so p1 now.What will p1 do? Now it will call welcome because it is possible to do this and welcome will be calling self dot hello for that. We will not get any error in this call. Let s save it and run it. So what is printed, we have hello person and we do not get any error. So how are things working? Things are working in such a way that if we make something private with double underscore, then it can be accessed only by those of the class.Only those which are internal functions will be able to access them, no one outside will be able to access them. This is basically done to prevent exposing our instance entity outside side of the class. So once we see its definition, private metrics and methods are meant to be used only within the class and not accessible from outside the class. Next concept which we will talk about is quite important.The concept is this is called inheritance. Now inheritance which we have already talked about is our Oops. There are four main pillars of Oops, two of which we have already read. Abstract Encapsulation. The third pillar is now we are going to read which is called inheritance and inheritance is a very important and very easy topic to be honest like in real life we know many things through inheritance.We are parents, they pass on their good values to us, so what have we done? In a way, the good values they have are the values that we have inherited. We inherit the things from grand parent to child. What is inheritance, similar concept of inheritance. When we pass anything from one generation of class to another generation of class, we call it inheritance. Now, what does it mean in programming? It means this.That when one class is derivative of another class for example inside the car which is a car, there will be a different method for how the car starts, there will be a different method for how the car stops and there can also be a color property inside this car, then the logic for starting and stopping the car is already written inside the car. Now, what can we do with the own car factory? We have written inside the code what we will do with that logic, the inheritance logic.We will derive it from the car class and how will we take it when we or methods methods also, we see inheritance. Once inside the code, for example, we created DocumentsFragment, we have, if we want, we can also keep these methods static, rest inside them, the S true car object is not being used, that is why I made these methods static, we can call it stop, what will the stop method do, it will stop the car, car car.Stopped, let s fix it, so this is our Car class inside which we have two simple methods. Now we are going to create another class which we will call Yota Car Yota Car and to show inheritance, we are going to put Panis here and inside it we will write the name of our class whose properties and methods we want to erase and then we can define Toyota Car. Let s assume this car. Inside there is something called name so let s create our constructor inside it just get self and well get name so self dot name is equal to name and now we are going to create our car so my car one is equal to a toyota.in and this thing will work absolutely no error will come inside it because inside this class of ours we have already given a name to carbon so when we run no error will come and for us car oneThe name of will be printed but if I try to do something like this car started then what should be expected in this case in this case maybe we first check when we run it then we will have it printed car started so in this way we will inherit our properties and our methods now let s assume here we would have defined some other property like we would have already specified the color here as edge black then we would have that thing here also.We can use car 1 color and that property also gets printed for us. Now we categorize inheritance into three different types. These are the three different types of inheritance. The first one is our single inheritance or we can also call it single level inheritance. Within this inheritance type, basically we have a single parent class or we can call it base class and from that we have a single derivative inheritance.There is a single parent class and a single child class. Now the next example that we will see will be multi level inheritance of multi level inheritance. It means that there is a base class, properties from the base class are derived from all those properties, meaning first, this is the first class, its properties, second class is its properties, the properties of both of them will be going inside our third ride class, so we can take an example in this that here let s assume that this is the property of our car.There are some basic methods which are there inside every car, from here we remove the color and after that we have already created a class with the name Yota Car. What we will do is just remove the name inside it, we will add the brand here, so instead of the name, now we will simply have the brand here and now let us keep a type like car of individual brand, what is the type going to be this, inside 4tune we will store the type now.All the properties are there, which is branded, basically that is the end, now what will we do, now we are going to call the start method for car one and this is the start method for car one, this is the end, we have given another brand to the third class, tomorrow maybe another factory will be setup which again this is my deriver simple C, we are going to see an example of this, we are going to create a class, let s assume that we have created a class A, this is my A class whoseInside we can create any variable let s assume variable A has some value f is welcome to class A. In this way our class is done and we have a class. Inside our B class B class there is something called a variable B inside which we are writing welcome to class B and then we have created a class C and what is this? This is our child class and what will it do by inheriting the properties of both A and B. You can do things like this.You can create inheritance variable or anything. Welcome to class C. So when we create a new object of C, we can print c1 variable c. Along with that, we can print c1 variable b and variable a. So print c1 variable a. Save it and run it. All the three things will be printed for us. There will be no error because all these properties have been created by it.Inheritance is what we read now. Next we are going to talk about another interesting concept which is related to inheritance which is our super method. Super method is a special method inside classes which is used to access methods of the parent class for example. Let s start again with this basic example. We can remove these things and what will a constructor do in his car?We will also create for the method, basically every car can have a type or fuel type or anything, we can call it is it going to be diesel, is it going to be petrol or electric, what is going to happen, so this one, we created a class as normal, what did we do inside the class, we defined a constructor inside which we are taking the type and Then we created two static methods, then what we did is class new Car of course, we also give its type. I am going to create an electric Prius. I don t know if it exists or not but let s assume that our type is electric, so here we have another variable, we will get the type. Now this type is here, but how will this thing come here, now this is the type variable, we have written it here, but if I do something like thisIf I write self dr type type then it will mean create but I am talking about the parent class whose properties we are inheriting, we can write super end and then our pennis dot, now inside the super class it becomes my super class and as soon as we wrote dot, all its methods will start coming, inside it there is a method start, inside it there is a method stop, similarly inside it we have our constructor method inside which now we pass our type.If we can pass the type in this way, then basically the constructor will be called inside the super class in which the type method has already been run. Now when we write carbon type here, we will not get any error when we run it, we get our type to be electric, the same thing in fact, we can do at the beginning of the constructor so that the properties of the parent class are set first, then by the way, as true functionality wise, there is no inside it.There will be no significant change, but in this way we can use our super constructor. In fact, if we want the car to be created as soon as this new car is created, I also want to start the car, then to start the car simply, we can write super dot start, then the start method of the super class will be called and the car will also be started, so the car is already started, so in this way, anytime we start ourIf we want to call any method of the parent class, then we can access them through super. Next we are going to talk about class method. Till now we had talked about the static method of static method decorator. Our static method decorator looked something like this by which we could make any method static. Any method being static means that for every new instance, everyThat method will not be created again and again for a new object. That method will remain common for the entire class. The method will be created only once for all the objects and all the objects can use it because the static method does not change the instance attribute, it is known, it accesses it, so there is no need to create it again and again for every object. But the problem with static methods is that they cannot access andModify class state and they are generally used for utility, i.e. if we have to do some work in which neither class s attributes nor instance s attributes are being used, for that generally we use our static methods inside Python, like here we have created the start method, as there is no attrition being used inside it, so we made it a static method and there is no attrile inside it too.If it is not being used then we made it a static thd but let s suppose we create a class. Let s start with a basic class called Person. Inside the person let s suppose we have a class Atable inside which we have stored the name as Anonymous. Now what we do is we create a method with the name change name or keep the change name in it, inside which we will have self , we will have a new name and we will write self .Dot name is equal to name, our aim will be that this name which was anonymous earlier, now it will be changed, so let s create a person p1 is equal to this new person and for p1, we want to call change name and instead of anonymous we want to name this guy Rahul Kumar and then we want to print the name for p1, so we save it and run, then what has become of name for us, it has become Rahul Kumar.The name of p1 became Rahul Kumar for us but interesting when I tried to print person dot name i.e. class name dot name then what will happen with this we will be able to access the class attribute i.e. this attribute so when we run it, we still have that name as Anonymous but we had to change this class attribute but as soon as we go to any normal Let s try to do this work inside the method, what does it do? This name here is not about the class attribute, it is creating a new name attribute for my instance for my object. If I explain it a little more carefully, then basically this was our class. Let s assume this is my class inside the class. This is my object. Now inside the class there was already a name named Atrio which had the value Anonymous, now we haveWhat we did was that we tried to change this anonymous thing through a method of the object, but it could not be changed directly. As soon as we wrote self name is equal to name , what happened inside the object, a new name was created inside the object, which we called Rahul Kumar. If this thing happened, then basically the name of the class became different. If the name of the object became different, then what did the self name do? The change name created a new name for it. But by writing this statement, we got that.No, we have to change the class attribute, now there are many indirect ways to change the class attribute, like for example, here we have written person.name is equal to name, this can be one way to change our class attribute, so when we change our class attribute in this way, the p1 name will be Rahul Kumar and we get the fact printed and the person.name is also Rahul Kumar.Let s save it and run, so now what happened is that it got changed at both the places, that is, by writing person dot name, that is, by writing this to make this attribute inside the class, now this new thing of ours has not been created, now all the new changes have happened inside this, one is this method, the second method is basically we write self dot under under class, this thing which is coming here, underscore underscore it, basically any object self means object.Whatever object we want to change inside the class, we can access its class, so it is shown here that the class is equal to person and then now what we are talking about here, it basically means the person, the person class and now we have any attribute of it i.e. even if we have accessed the name, here Rahul will be deleted, even if we print it again, we will get the same result, so either we can write self d class dot something orThen we can write the name of our class dot something. Now these methods can be done, but if we want to be able to directly access our class within our function, then the way to write it is our class methods, that is, the work which static methods cannot do, class is defined as bound to the class and receive the class as an implicit first argument, which is normal as we have been creating the method till now, like the name has been changed in whichHere comes self, self means object, what is this, this is basically our object, like this is a normal method, instance method, similarly we also have class methods in which the first argument is class instead of self and to write this, we use our class method decorator and then write definition and then the name of our function and in that as the first argument, we take our class like here if this sameIf I had to work, we could have created another new function, we will call it class method and we can write it inside def change name and change name. This time the first argument will be with us, class class will be the keyword. Well, we will write it as CLS and a new name can come inside it and as soon as we say name inside it, we will do this. Now where will this change happen directly? This change is directly related to my class and we will save it.If we run and then this time the change has happened directly in the attrib of the class, this is the thing, this is not itself, this is actually referring to the class, so what did this decorator do, the class method decorator took this function and returned another new better function which is directly in the attrib of the class. Now here at this point, we might have got a little confusion in one thing that now basically we have three types ofFunctions have become, the first type of functions are our static methods or methods which we call, the second type of methods are our class methods and the third type of methods are our normal methods or I should call them instance methods. Instance methods are methods basically. Instance methods are those which take self as an argument, class methods are those which take class as a first implicit argument and static methods are those which do not change or access the attributes of either the class or the instance. So basically when we have to do some work in which we are not touching any method of the class or instance, neither we are using it nor we are using its properties.We will use the starting method when we have to use only the class attribute, the instance attribute, there we will use the instance methods, so these are three types of different methods inside the classes which we have read, now next we will talk about another decorator, which is the property decorator for example, we create a class called Student, we have created the Student class now.Inside student we define our constructor. Self comes inside the constructor and we have marks of three subjects. We can take any three subjects. We take Physics, Chemistry, Math. These are basically values. So what do we do? First of all, self dot chemistry is equal to chemistry and self dot math is equal to math. We have marks of these three different subjects.Now we want that for this student class, we want to have another table, percentage table, inside this class, we want to create it, so either we can create it here, we can write self dot percentage, what will happen, percentage will be equal to the marks of all the three subjects, f will be self dot physics plus self dot chemistry plus self dot math divided by 3. What is this?Our percentage will be done and if I have to convert it inside the string, I can type cast all of this to string and inside this then we will also add a percentage sign, then basically this will be my percentage. Let s create a new student and let s see this is my student one for which by passing some values let s assume that we have passed the marks and then what are we getting printed then we are getting student printed.In a very simple way, the percentage of our student has come to 98.7 but till now there is nothing really problematic, everything is simple, now just imagine a small scenario, let s assume, what did the teacher do yesterday, rechecked the papers and he came to know that the student scored this 98 in Physics, this should actually be 86, this is his score by mistake, 98What will the teacher do if it comes? The teacher will simply write down that the physics marks of student one are supposed to be 86. The student has written the teacher and now when we will get the student s physics marks printed, that change will also come. That change has come. It is equal to 86 but the problem is that when we will get the student s percentage printed again, that percentage will be automatic.There will be no change in the percentage, it has been set according to the old marks. The value of the percentage has been set according to the original values, but we want that as soon as the marks change, the percentage should also change, otherwise the percentage will be wrong. So for such cases, when we cannot give a fixed value to any tribute, then its value should be based on some other parameter or some calculation.So we can create a let s suppose method here and we can call it calculate percentage, we have created a method which we are calling calculate percentage, now in calculate percentage we know that inside this method itself, the value of percentage should always be this, so basically first we will change the marks, then we will again call calculate percentage for the student and then change his percentage.It will be done, this is absolutely the right way, there is really no problem in it, but there is another and better and simpler way to do the same thing, we have property decorators, so basically we use property decorator on any method in the class to use the method as a property, so basically what is the work of this calculate percentage function, its work is just to calculate the percentage which is normal, what is normal, which is an attribute.But when we can make only an attritional function our property, saying property means here the attritional method would be that we would write rate property here. And after that we will create a function in which we will write the name of our ATRICA, my ATRICA name is basically percentage, I have to calculate the percentage, inside the percentage we will have self and we have to return this value, this is basically by percentage, so this is my method which will return the value of my property, so def percentage percentage is the name of the method and inside it this value is being returned.This value will also be returned, it will basically be converted into a property i.e. it will be converted into an attribute and now when I change my physics marks, what will happen here? Here I will not need to do all these calculations, that means I will not have to call any extra method separately. As soon as I change the marks, my percentage will also change. Let s save it and run. Okay, this is the error we are getting basically.Let s remove this thing because of indentation and we have not done proper indentation. Now all these things will work. Let s run it. So in the beginning, the percentage was 98 but as soon as the marks of Physics decreased, the percentage will fall to 94. So in this way, automatic change is happening. Now it is not so because whatever we have given the rate property, as soon as there is a change in any other parameter, that change will be reflected here automatically.Now whenever we access the percentage, we will always be getting the calculated returns from the latest values. Now the last concept which we are going to cover is this is related to Polymorphous. Once again let me revise you. When we talked about Oops, in the beginning we saw that there are four pillars of Oops. Out of the four pillars, we have already read three pillars. We have talked about Abstractor.En capsule lesson we have talked about inheritance and now we are talking about the fourth pillar which means whose name is polymorphous. Now poly means poly is basically many means many and morph means forms or faces. If we can think in this way then saying polymorphous means that when the same thing can be used in different ways then it basically comes in the category of polymorphous and in Python.Inside, the best example of polymorphism is that we have operator overloading, what is operator overloading, we are going to study it in detail now, okay one more additional thing here, if you want to study more about decorators, this is a homework problem, I am giving you what you can do is two and we have decorators like getter and setter, so far we have studied multiple decorators.Within decorators, we have read about property decorators. We have read about static methods. We have read about class methods. If you want to read about more decorators, you can also read about getter and setter decorators. So, coming back to polymorphism, operator overloading is basically when the same operator is allowed to have different meanings.According to the context i.e. operator, we have the same for example, our plus operator plus depending upon which data type or in which situation we are using it, its meaning will change, like let us see a practical example of this which already exists, if we want, we can get it printed 1 P 2 This thing is completely possible, what will be its result, its result will be here operatorWhat is the operator here, it is plus operator, so we know that the work of plus operator is to add the numbers, it has done it here but if I try to print my with college, now here also there is plus operator but these values are numbers, otherwise what will be the work of plus operator here, here the work of plus operator will be to concatenate two strings and in the answer we will get the concatenation of both the strings returned, so what has happened, overloading of plus numbers.When we are using plus, the meaning is different and when we are using strings, the meaning of plus is different and when we are using lists, the meaning of plus is also different, that is, when I print 1 2 3 4 5 6, then here it will be that we are basically trying to merge two lists in a way, so here the meaning of plus will be different whereas what is plus, plus is an operator but because Here, different meanings come according to different data types, so this is what we call operator overloading and it is a type of polymorphism. Polymorphism says that there are multiple forms of the same thing, so this is the first form, this is the second form, this is the third form and we are going to see the forms too, but as soon as we save it and run it, we will get different types of outputs, meaning the meaning of plus has changed, plus for strings.The meaning of plus is something else for numbers. The meaning of plus is something else for a list. Meaning, if we wrote plus here, then this one got added to this four, this two got added to this five, meaning this could also have been the meaning but it did not happen because it is already defined inside the list class. What would be the meaning of plus whenever we are talking about this number? What is a number, what is an integer if.I try to print type of one, what will I get? Class Int. Basically, inside Python, there is already a class called Int. If I write any number, any integer, it will basically be an object of that class, then it is an object and this is an object and these objects because Int is of type Int, it is already defined for them inside that class int that plus means add two numbers, similarly if we here.But if I try to print type of Apna, then what is Apna or what is college? This is basically class string. Let me run it. So what is this class string? So inside Python, there is already a string class. What are all the strings of which are objects? So this is an object. This is an object. This is an object. And inside this class string, it is already defined that whenever plus is written, what does it mean? It means adding two strings, like this ifI try to print type of 1, 2 and 3, so what will come here, we will get the class list here, then add python3 with the number, it does not mean defined, inside that list class, it is defined that the entire list will be merged, wherever plus will be written, then in this way, the different operators inside each class, their meanings are already defined for different different data types, so it is the same when we create our own class.So we can also do operator overloading for ourselves. What is all of this is implicit sit overloading, which is already what we are going to learn. So now here we must have understood when the same operator is allowed to have different meanings according to the context. Context depends on whether you are trying to write some code with numbers, trying to write with strings, trying to write with lists. Okay, IHere, according to me, I am going to use a good example of operator overloading, so a little math for that. If you have talked about complexity in 11th and 12th, I will explain to you the basic concept of the same and for those who have not heard, there is no problem for them, I am going to explain it to you in a similar way, so basically in math, there is something called complexity now.I will not go into complicated, very simple plus or minus like I am going to show you something like we have a normal number, normal numbers are basically what we call our real numbers, normal numbers are what we call real numbers, like one becomes, like two becomes like three or 5 becomes or 3.1, all these are real numbers. Now when we add the numbers, I already know that 1 is 2 is.Going to be equal to 3, the math of real numbers is very easy, the same thing we are studying in math is complicated, just this I have written something, this thing is called complexity, now why is it called, what does it mean, why are complexations used, we will not go into real and complex, basically this is a complicated part and which is written with J, this is my imaginary part, meaning there is real one and imaginary is three and thisBasically, it is that part of math which has been imagined, meaning this is imaginary. Now let s take this as my first consideration. When complex is made, what happens is that its real parts are added separately and its imaginary parts are added separately, so here when these If added then the answer is going to be 1 2 3i 3 5 8j This is absolutely correct, this thing, I was just trying to teach you that there is a thing called complexation, it has no relation to Python as a matter of fact, all two complexations are used within the systems, meaning our audio waves in the voice, within those systems we use complexity numbers for calculation, if you go ahead.You do some machine learning etc. on voice recognition, but we do not need to go into details, we will not discuss it much but this is a complexity. Numbers are added like this. We add the real part separately. We add the image part separately. Let me give you another example. Let s suppose we have a complexity number 1i 8j. So what will be the answer to this?The answer will be five and we are adding these, we will add 5 and 1, we will add 4, we will get 4i 18j, this is basically, there is no class to create edge true inside such a complex, otherwise what will we do, we will create our own class and such a class which is a complex class, inside Python you can create integer numbers, you can create strings, you can create lists, you can create dictionaries.But it is not for creating a complex, so we are going to create that thing. We are basically going to create a class called complex. Let s define in it every one which is its imaginary part, so self dot real is equal to real and self dot imaginary is equal to imaginary and let s write another function, let s call it show number. Inside show number, basically we print our number.So what are we going to print? First of all, we will print its real part. Real part is going to be self dot real. Then inside this we will basically print i. Plus and then we will print its imaginary part. And then we will print h. This is going to be our number which will be printed. So now a new let s save it and run. So this is my first complex number two inside which we will pass.4i and 6j, this is my number two. Let s print this too, so this has become my number one. This has become my number two. Now we want to add these two, so now we will have to create the logic to add them, so how will we be able to do that, how do we know in what way I have to add these two numbers, as soon as what is the logic to complicate these, then here we have our ender functions and we do this in this way.Operator overloading means that we define the meaning of plus for ourselves. We do it using Dund function. Dund functions are Double Underscore. The functions we put in front of Double Underscore are called under functions and many of these functions are already present in Python. Out of these, we will read one function in detail now in a very basic manner, so basically what happens whenever we put this a on top of anything.b can also be an integer array, it can also be an integer array, it can be a and b string, it can be a and b string, it can also be a list, whenever we write a b, whenever we are doing addition, what happens internally, inside that class, we are basically trying to call a function, underscore, underscore, d, underscore, for one object, in which we will pass another number and basically what it will do is a.This function of ours is defining the logic of adding inside, like if we want to create a complex, def d, this is a normal function, what does it do, self will come inside it, self means object one or I can also call it object one or number one, we can call it this is basically my number one and inside this we will take another parameter, which is my number two, let s call it self, first we will have self, which is my object and a number will come.Two or it is called object two or number two is also fine. Now I have to define the logic to add two numbers. The logic of adding two numbers will be that basically the new real part is inside the new number. The new real part is what should be inside the number. That real part should be itself dot real plus number two dot real. In this way our new real part will be created and how will our new imaginary part be created.Self dot imaginary plus number to dot imaginary now What can we do inside add? Now we will create a new complex inside d in which new real part and new imaginary part will come and we will return this complex from here. Basically this is I have created an add function which adds two numbers and now here I am trying to add number one with number two so I can write number is equal to number two and number two is I don t think this.Should we have any confusion inside the syntax, normally what I have done is I have just called my add function inside the number one and now I can print my number three let s save it or number three should not be printed like this number 3 dot show number has to be called and let s run it so what happened is by adding these two numbers the third number has come so we have added one and four so we have five and three and six we haveIf we add then we get nine. This is the correct calculation. In this way we do not have to write our complex. Here I want someone to come to me and say that there is unsupported operant type plus for complexity. It is saying that you cannot use plus at all. Complexity is not even defined. Similarly, we can use little plus. There is logic in Integer class, there is logic in String class, there is logic inside List class, but there is no logic in your class.No, to use the plus operator to define plus, we can define that logic inside our class. Using the dnd functions. To create the dnd function, we basically have to write add here, because add is already a dnd function, so here to use the dnd function, what I will do is a and after that, what has become of this, now this is my dander.The function has been created, by doing only this thing, now there will be no error in this code. Now if I minimize it and re execute, now I am not getting any error. Now simply what has happened, these things have started working, meaning, what is happening here, I made plus two. It was already not possible in Python, now like this, let s assume that I have to define the logic of minus that real should be minus from real.Imaginary should be minus from imaginary, so for its logic, our a my b s subx s subx s under function is Underscore Underscore sub, so I can write here, let s save it and write it here, this will be the function for subx, and here I just have to do minus, so if I can also subtract one of my numbers from another number, let s save it, if we run, then basically one.Out of four substacks, we got 3, out of three, six substacks got 3, we have to deal with that little sign, but this is basically how subsection will work, it was complicated, we can define that logic, I am using the same operators, it s just that the meaning of the operator with subsection has changed. What has happened, this function has become this.How operator overloading works and this is operator overloading. I changed the meaning of minus for my class. This is called operator overloading and this is the implementation of polymorphous jm. Meaning, this is what we called polymorphous jm when we are implementing classes and objects and under function. It is not just that there is an arrhythmia, also an under function, this also has a double underscore here.So that s why dnd functions are special a lot of them are already inbuilt in python and if we want to see more dnd functions then basically we can go to the python documentation we can go to this link and here under section 3.3.8 this is basically add subtitle multiplication a mat multiplication true div floor div mod mod is basically for percentage in this wayWe have power function, we also have functions for edge and and and and if we scroll down further, we can see more different things like ABS becomes ABS i.e. absolute value which is a math function and not negative also can be made positive, the functions of that method, the implementation of that method, we can do those things, so this was all about oops in Python different.There are different concepts which are our four main pillars, we have covered them, a lot of things will seem a little theoretical in the above, we will feel that it Where should we use it? Many times, when we are using Oops as a beginner, many times a lot of things may feel unnecessary to us because when we work on small projects, Oops does not make that much sense, but whenever we go into real world programming, whenever we actually start working inside companies, there a lot of things are done through Oops, which means if some code is being written, then inside it we can use classes and objects.By creating and structuring that code, that is why oops is really important and also for interview point of view, so next we are going to solve some practice questions. Let s take the first question and start with the easy question. Define Circle class to create circle with radius. Using the constructor does only this part. Let us create our class which will call it Circle.Inside the circle class we will have an it constructor which has self and our radius is self dot radius e equal to radius and then now what we will do is a new circle let s suppose we create this is my circle whose radius is equal to 4 I have created this or let s give a better radius let s give it a radius of 21 which is a multiple of sane so that it becomes easier for us in the calculations.Next what we will do is next we have to define an area method of the class which calculates the area of the circle and in the same way a perimeter class. Now I know that if I have radius r of any circle then its area is going to be pa aa s and perimeter is going to be equal to 2 pa aa k. This is a little bit of math calculation but remembering the formula is not important, here being able to convert that thing into code is the most important thing.What is important is so we will define a method called area and inside it we are going to return this value f e basically pi we have to return pa a square 3.14 n a square so whatever our radius is self dot radius to the power p this thing we have to return and also we have perimeter inside which self will come inside this we have to return T pa r f self dot radius y which is the circle for thisWe will print the area of the circle and we will print the radius of the circle not its radius but its perimeter. Let s save it and run. A better way to do it would be instead of 3.14 I take it as 22 7 and I also take it as 22 7. Save and run. So if we have even values then the area will be 1386 units. We don t have it now and the perimeter will beEqual to 132 So in this way we have defined our class Let s come to the next class Define an Employee class with attribute Employee should have a role He should have a department and his salary This class also has a show details method So first of all let s create an Employee class Employee in which inside it we are going to have a role We areGoing to have a department and we are going to have salary self dot role e equal to role self dot department e equal to department and self dot salary e equal to salary and one more we will create a method f show details we call it show details inside this we have self and we have to print l the details so we have printed it here we will write role eEqual to role self dot role then well print department e equal to self dot department and salary double quotes salary e equal to self dot salary so if we want we can also create a new employee e and is equal to my employee for whom what is the role let s assume the apple attend the department is basically they are in the financeDepartment and the salary is I don t know an accountant salary I will make it 60000 and a string I have made it of string type and for the one we will call show details let s save it and run so all these details are printed for us now the next thing what we have to do is inside this we have to create an engineer class that inheritance additional atrio name and age so we have aAnd we have to create a class and we will call this class Engineer and what Engineer is doing is that it will rate all the properties of the employee and inside it we will have attributes with our own attributes. One will be name, one will be edge but with that or if we keep this for now, then self dot name e to self dot age equal to edge and together what will we do is employee. For all the engineers who want to keep the IT department and salary fixed, then using super we will call the constructor in which we will pass the role, roll is going to be engineer and then we will pass on the department and then we will pass on basically the salary. Let s take the salary to be.75000 and we save it, so here instead of employee one, we will do engineer one and inside our engineer class, we will pass some values, name is done, let s assume, let s take it to be lon mask and age I don t know, may be 40 and then for our engineer one, we are going to call show details, let s save it and run, so inside show details, the complete information of the engineer has come and in the same way, weIf you want, you can also call a show details separately inside it. Basically this is how inheritance works. Next we will solve another practice question. It is asking us to create a class called Order which stores items and its items. So, let s create a normal class named Order. For every order, two values will be passed inside the constructor, one will be the item name and one will be the price of that item. So self.Dot item is equal to my item and self dot price is equal to my price Now we have got some basic values. Now what do we have to do? Let s assume that we have created order one. Order one is equal to two within which we buy a packet of chips and we buy it for . And within order two we order some tea and we order it for . This is our basic values. Now what do we have to do? Inside this class we haveTo use a dnd function, what is the GT function, GT means greater than, so whenever we write a greater than b, then basically this is our dnd function, it gets invoked, then the logic of greater than is defined, there is a separate logic for strings, there is a separate logic for int, there is a separate logic for the list, so every class has its own separate logic, we have to put the logic for our order class.Basically we go to the rule function i.e. as soon as we write order one greater than order two then it should be true or false. Its answer will depend on order one greater than order two. It will be true only if the price of order one is greater than the price of order two, then the property of greater number is dependent on the price, so we can define a rule function for that, how do we write the name of our function gt2, what do we do inside it?Basically we will return the price of self, if it is greater than the price of order two, then it should be true, then the same thing will be returned here, so now we can get it printed, my order one is greater than order two, we will have the answer printed, what is order one, 20, what is order two, its price is 15, so obviously this value is greater than this value, so here we will get true return, let s save it.And run we will get true error will not come but if we had not written this function then we would have got the error that the operator of greater than is not supported at all for the instances of order and order so this is the benefit of the stick functions that in this way if we have defined a custom class for ourselves and inside it we want to create the logic of greater than less than is not equal to twoSo, we can write all that logic sitting by ourselves. Similarly, if we wanted, we could have created the logic of less than one, we could have also created the logic of equal to two. So this is all about Object Oriented Programming in Python. I hope that we would have enjoyed today s lecture. We would have learned a lot of new concepts within it and we will revise all these concepts after going through them. You will find the link to download the notes once again in the description below.Inside the box, you will get this much, for today till then keep learning and keep practicing. Okay, one more small extra information here that we have studied a lot of concepts till pythonanywhere.com, so now only our last lecture will be left, which will not be conceptual but basically implementation wise project oriented, so for today, till then, till the next lecture, you will get this much.Keep learning and keep practicing
=======
Large language models like Chat GPT can answer almost all types of questions but when it comes to providing authoritative answers with sources, these models get a bit stuck because they give answers on the basis of their training data. They do not take that answer from real time sources and their training data is not always up to date. So what is the solution to this problem? Here comes an excellent technique called retrieve.Augmented Generation or RAG Let us understand what this RAG is, how it works and what can be done using it. Hello, I am Vikram Singh Chandel Your own Analytics Music Praise Music Guru Retrieve Augmented Generation or RAG is a technique that makes generative AI models more accurate and reliable by bringing facts from external sources. Basically this technologyFixes the issue of accuracy and reliability of LLM. With this, LLMs are able to answer general prompts faster. When something has to be generated on a current or more specific topic, then this technique becomes even more useful. There were a total of 12 people who developed Ruck, the main of which was Patrick Lewis who coined the name Ragna. Lewis and his 11 colleagues together created it so that generativeAI services can be linked to external resources, especially those with the latest technical details. Louis wrote a paper with his colleagues in 2020. In it, Rack was called a general purpose fine tuning recipe because almost any LLM can be connected to practically any external resource.So that users can check any claim themselves, this builds trust on the models. A very good and useful example of this is Perplexity AI which is an answer machine type model. It is a combination of RUGS and LLM where users can ask anything and the model answers them with sources. Then they can also cross check the given answer. Due to this technique, the chances of LLM guessing anything wrong are reduced becauseThe models already have a source that provides the proper context, so they do much less learning. Another big advantage of Ruck is that it is relatively easy. Louis and three other co authors of the original paper explained in a blog that developers can implement this process in just five lines of code, making this method faster and less expensive than fine tuning and allowing users to learn on the go.Sources can be hot swapped. Hot swap means changing models or sources without turning off the system. But how does this rack work? First it takes the data from a database document website or API and then divides them into small chunks and converts them into vector representations or embeddings. Then these vector embeddings are stored in a specialized vector database so that when the time comes according to the user s query.Here, when a user gives a query, it is also converted into a vector embedding, then that query embedding is compared with the vector database and the top relevant chunks are retrieved so that these retrieved chunks can be merged with the original query to form an augmented context. After this, this augmented context is fed into an LLM model such as GPT.4 or Clot 3 is then fed to the final output of the generated response model which provides relevant and information rich answers to the user s queries. Ruck can be used in conjunction with LLM or independently. When used with LLM, responses are more fluent. Context rich because it provides LLM with relevant and up to date information from external sources. With Ruck youPractically, it can talk to any data collection, which opens up many new possibilities. For example, a generative AI model implemented with a medical index can be a very helpful assistant for a doctor or nurse in a hospital. The same thing can also be made for a financial analyst which is linked to market data, which means that any business can convert its technical or policy manual videos or logs into a knowledge base. I hope you have understood well about the rack from this video, but if you have any question in your mind, then do ask in the comments and do tell me what you think about this technique and what other applications it can have. Let s meet now in the next video. Till then stay cool and keep learning and teaching.
