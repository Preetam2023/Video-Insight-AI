# Educational Notes

## Summary
 In this part, there will be inheritance, polymorphism, we will cover the important concepts of this method, implement them and then solve practice questions based on them . The del keyword is used to delete object properties or the entity itself any object . If we create an object inside the code, then what it does is that some space is occupied inside the memory because there are some methods related to the object, its many different attribute attributes take up space inside our memory, so many times it may happen that we have created an object which we never want to use later, then we can individually delete its properties and also delete that object . By attribute we can also delete our complete object. So in this case we have an error because the name s1 is not defined why

## Key Points
- in and this thing will work absolutely no error will come inside it because inside this class of ours we have already given a name to carbon so when we run no error will come and for us car oneThe name of will be printed but if I try to do something like this car started then what should be expected in this case in this case maybe we first check when we run it then we will have it printed car started so in this way we will inherit our properties and our methods now let s assume here we would have defined some other property like we would have already specified the color here as edge black then we would have that thing here also
- When we are using plus, the meaning is different and when we are using strings, the meaning of plus is different and when we are using lists, the meaning of plus is also different, that is, when I print 1 2 3 4 5 6, then here it will be that we are basically trying to merge two lists in a way, so here the meaning of plus will be different whereas what is plus, plus is an operator but because Here, different meanings come according to different data types, so this is what we call operator overloading and it is a type of polymorphism
- When I try to print these things, both of them will be printed forMe but generally this is a bad practice because the account password is such a thing that maybe inside this code we should not pass it outside this account class because whatever is publicly available increases the chances of accidental changes inside it and decreases the security inside it
- We don t have it now and the perimeter will beEqual to 132 So in this way we have defined our class Let s come to the next class Define an Employee class with attribute Employee should have a role He should have a department and his salary This class also has a show details method So first of all let s create an Employee class Employee in which inside it we are going to have a role We areGoing to have a department and we are going to have salary self dot role e equal to role self dot department e equal to department and self dot salary e equal to salary and one more we will create a method f show details we call it show details inside this we have self and we have to print l the details so we have printed it here we will write role eEqual to role self dot role then well print department e equal to self dot department and salary double quotes salary e equal to self dot salary so if we want we can also create a new employee e and is equal to my employee for whom what is the role let s assume the apple attend the department is basically they are in the financeDepartment and the salary is I don t know an accountant salary I will make it 60000 and a string I have made it of string type and for the one we will call show details let s save it and run so all these details are printed for us now the next thing what we have to do is inside this we have to create an engineer class that inheritance additional atrio name and age so we have aAnd we have to create a class and we will call this class Engineer and what Engineer is doing is that it will rate all the properties of the employee and inside it we will have attributes with our own attributes
- So we can create a let s suppose method here and we can call it calculate percentage, we have created a method which we are calling calculate percentage, now in calculate percentage we know that inside this method itself, the value of percentage should always be this, so basically first we will change the marks, then we will again call calculate percentage for the student and then change his percentage
- So they are available in this playlist above this channel, so we can go and watch them, we will find the link to download And Like Always Notes in the description box below, from there we can access our slides, so let s start with our next lecture, so oops in the chapter, we are going to read the next concept like this is the del keyword del keyword is used to delete object properties or the entity itself any object
- Should we have any confusion inside the syntax, normally what I have done is I have just called my add function inside the number one and now I can print my number three let s save it or number three should not be printed like this number 3 dot show number has to be called and let s run it so what happened is by adding these two numbers the third number has come so we have added one and four so we have five and three and six we haveIf we add then we get nine
- Now here at this point, we might have got a little confusion in one thing that now basically we have three types ofFunctions have become, the first type of functions are our static methods or methods which we call, the second type of methods are our class methods and the third type of methods are our normal methods or I should call them instance methods
