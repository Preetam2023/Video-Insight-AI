Hello my dear students once again very good morning my dear soldiers welcome in my family are you getting my voice tell me please audio video is clear my dear ones again very good morning my dear shaljas tel me tel me tel me fast audio player son apna kya paath rahe the son opening is reading the what sir we are reading pipe planning the and you told in the pipeline inThere are three types of dependencies Structural Dependency Second one is Data Dependency and third one is Control Dependency Sir Control Dependency and What is it D Course What is it D Coach Four Structural Dependency sir Structure Dependency What is the reason due to resource conflict Data Dependency Due to operate or data key When is the next instruction When the next instruction is the result of previous instruction willB Created My Dear Student Created Control Dependency What is the reason due to branch operations branch TOC type transfer of control flow addressing mode has these reasons children and what is it D solution for this WAN its solution apne saw its solution apne dekha rename kya children renaming read a lot of it one to interlock hardware interlock ing key before store in Dana destination register you justPatch the data yes or no till nine this point C have given in D WAN formula also execution time in five planning is what's plus n minus WAN in TP how it came I also gave you the explanation of that speed factor when very large number of task ton/TP how will this happen because you know how much execution time is in non pipe planning increase give what happen you are gettingApproximate se value of k plus n - 1 and I told you like take ₹ 10000 and take four stages if you are taking only four instruction give date is not happening but if you taking 10000 give what happen you are getting k plus and minus van approximate equal to n within dat condition time in pipeline is ahead van task education time in non pipeline which is a taskFive planning will take the same time as non pipe cleaning but when pipe lining is not perfectly balanced then it may be that the task execution time which is in pipe line may be more but whenever also increase the number of instruction or give task pipeline performance is up my dear not only get up it is un best even crystal clear tell me tell me tell me fast write quickly ok satyam I will check see till nowI am not checking your comments watever comment section of d video ok nine suniyega children kya kehna chahta hai ever dependency in d pipeline apna had read two types of dependency third hoti control dependency what son control dependency what is d meaning of control dependency what is d meaning of control dependency let's suppose i van hai ai tu hai i3 hai jump type ka hai khi ki type jump any x address moment kiLet's talk tree, you understand son, keep in mind what I taught you, jump type, as soon as my iPhone my iPhone has gone from my patch to decode, as soon as my iPhone has gone from my patch to record, give what is happening I5 next instruction because it is always like first i1i2 I3 i4 I5 i6 then next sequential instruction must have come here I5 but as soon as jump anyX Address Here is something of mine, take me I X AThe addition subtraction multiplication normal is decreasing da so my next was going well wanted but but but suniyega my point as soon as I sent the iPhone like iPhone went into the record from my face let's s usual routine procedure I5 will insert in D fetch stage but when I decoded D iPhone when I came to know this is not a normal instruction this is not a normal structure this is not a normal instruction said then Addition Subtraction Multiplication
Division Load Store Whatever Good Morning Priya Chaudhary Good Morning Now, who will have to execute my i101 but I had shouted to you that at the time of Faiz, I do not know that there is an atom bomb in it, I have the data in the instruction, what is there in the time, so son, now this I5, what has become of me, notary required, unwanted, what has become unwanted, then what will I have to do with it, will have to be removed, will have to be flashed.You will have to flash yes or no flash or a keyword and let's do it, you will have to freeze it and because of these, the stalls that I will get, what kahlayegi branch penalty, what kahlayegi branch penalty will learn my point, what do you want to say, sometimes what do you want to say, sometimes Good Ashutosh God bless you God bless you son Control dependency what happens control dependency how install is created so control dependency is created due to due you branch operation or TUCType Operation Pass Mains Theory of Computation No Transfer of Control Operation Transfer of Control How Sir Suniyega Man Take I Van Mera Was Normal Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division So To Aapka I Tu I3 i4 All was going well Good morning Arpita So your all was going well but as soon as I sent the iPhone, it became a phase, it became a face, but after the face, as soon as it went into the record, it was analyzed in the decode, it was analyzed in the record that iPhoneLook at the script, understand the full iPhone, which is my jumpWhose child has I 101, so it is unwanted for me, so I will have to remove it, I will have to remove it, that is, I will have to flash it, because of that I will get stalls and what are those sterols called, what are those stones called, what is called branch penalty, children, till now I have understood the thing, till now I have understood the thing, sir, what is the value of this branch penalty, this is the value of branch penalty.How much is it sir, at which stage, what stage target address is available, what does it mean, now I understand, GATE 2022 too, Question-1, children, see once here, suniyega, children, in which stage I came to know whether the next one is good or needed or not, in which stage I came to know whether the next one is instruction required for me or not, I came to know in the second stage, what thing is in the second stage, if I came to know in the second stage, then branch penalty.How much would one come to me, if I had known here in the third stage, then what would I have done, here someone else had taken it and here too, if someone else had taken it, then how much would I have come to two, Prashant Good Morning Good Morning Priya Good Morning Structural Data and Control Yes Learning with D Way Good Morning Suniyega, come a little early child, I will repeat again and do it on time only. You know that I myself should not be late for the class, that is why many times I myself am late from my side.If it happens, then I will run away from the car immediately, friend, you should not run away lightly and you too should not run away, but I try to come on time, so you also try a little, get free and go to jail, son, the rest will meet you in Piyush, you will meet in new questions, you will meet in formula revision, he will meet children, you have three types of dependencies, structural data and control structure, I have already told you, due to resource conflict, due to data operant.Also told the solution to you, operate forwarding and its renaming and control dependency occurs due to branch instruction, so what is the meaning of branch instruction like iPhone goes for addition-va ki guna bhag tha aayi tu I3 like iPhone goes at the time of iPhone, then I don't know anything. At the time of phase, don't say sorry, at the time of catch, I don't know anything, but as soon as I went from face to decode, it went to iPhone. Next health instruction I5 was inserted next.Instruction I5 was inserted but as soon as I decoded the code I realized what would be the next instruction after Jump 4000 i.e. iPhone.
It would be 101 but what I did was to replace this instruction in pipelining with I5. When this space became vacant, what would I have to do now? This I5 will not work. If it won't work, I5 will have to be removed. So I5 is unwanted for me. What is it called to remove it? Flash or Fridge and due to this, I will have to install it. What is this called branch penalty? What is the meaning of branch penalty? What is the meaning of branch penalty?Number of Stones YouTube So because of these, what is called branch penalty and what will be the value of branch penalty, on which stage I am getting the address, mines van, if I am from, I am getting the address at the second stage, here in which state, I am getting the address at the second stage, then what will be the value of the branch penalty, 2 - 1, then it is branch penalty, if I say, I am getting the address at the third stage,If the third stage had spoken, then what would have been the branch penalty? If the third stage had spoken, how much would have been the branch penalty? 3 - 1 How is this samjhaunga happening, what is happening, you fill it properly, fill it properly, if I know here whether the next one is legitimate or not required, wanted or unwanted or required or not required, then how much loss did I suffer because till the time this one wentIf I had known here, where else would I have found out, Sir, tell me where would I have known, if I had known here, then how many stages would I have lost if I cheated, one would have brought me till here, one would have brought this one, would have brought this one, would have brought this one here, and in the recording, two points would have to be raised, if the value of branch penalty would be calculated, sir, how would the value of branch penalty be calculated? Then the value of branch penalty would be calculated at which stage it is given to me.-1 I even understood how to calculate the value of branch penalty. When I came to know at the second stage, what did I do? I replaced the iPhone with I 101. Instead of I 101, I brought I5 instead of I 101. So I had to remove I. You understood my point, how much did I install for one because at the second stage I came to know that all the children should write in the chat box. So son, this is how I talked about how many are coming because of one.How many instructions will be given on the stones? What is the branch frequency? Sir, how much is the branch penalty for such instructions? How much is the branch penalty for such instructions? Sir, understand the branch penalty. Children, see what I am saying. Control Dependency comes in very simple numerical form. There is no need to worry at all. Do you know what happens in this? How much does it take for the ideal, it takes one cycle, that cycle time can be anything, but it takes one cycle, one cycle, each one.Let's go through a cycle with but but but many times such jumpy instructions go to us, jump not zero, this type of instructions go to us, whether pass is conditional or unconditional, due to this my sequence gets changed, due to this I have to suffer a little loss, like if I had a data dependency, if it was data dependent, I had to wait, I had to wait, here also what did I have to do, eat a little bit of stall, that stall is happening.What is branch penalty called and how much sir will have to eat depends on at which stage I have found out whether I want the next one or not i.e. whether the branch structure is true i.e. the condition is true or not, so assume if I find out on the second stage then I will have to eat one, if I find out on the third then I will have to eat two, if I find out on the punch then I will have to eat four, if I find out on the third then I will have to eat two, then sir, how many will have to eat due to one instruction from A.Branch penalty came that how many will have to be eaten and it is like how many are there, how many percent are horses in the forest, what is the percentage of share, how many percent are in hands, how many are there, okay, so this is your instruction on number of stools. Now listen to the children, what will be the average instruction execution timing. You will know how much is generally the cost of van and van, no, how much will be done now, how much will be done now, instruction on number of stools 1 + cycle time, you must have understood my point.Average Instruction Execution Time in Pipeline with Stolen Sir, understand this numerically. Let's also come to this. Let's do this first. You will learn it. Children, there is a 5 stage pipeline. Children, let me explain it to you numerically.
Yes I am Shweta Pandey Target Address The condition in the third stage Next one is my question Is the next one required for me or not I know the post in the third stage and processor stroke fencing will open new structure Conditional branch until the branch outcome is non and total is so many instructions 20% are conditional branch instructions instructions take van cycle tu complete give what is this de totalProgram Execution Timing What is it? Total Program Education Timing i.e. sometimes what is this to you, what is this to you, sometimes what is this to you, what is the branch frequency, 20%, keep the pen copy and the child, what is the branch frequency, 20% is okay and branch penalty, at which stage the address is being posted, so what stage, target address is available, speak quickly, speak quickly, reply in the chat box, Dada is not wearing a cloak.It will work quickly children very good thank you Shweta branch penalty will go branch frequency in tu branch penalty clear dance frequency kitna hai 20% branch beta kitna a jaayga oneplus 0.4 cycle time is van upon time how much is 1 gigahertz so your answer is 1.4 * power of 10 minus nine of one instruction and how many are there in the total program son power of 109 instructions, then how much will be the execution time of the program? Execution time of the program will be 1.4 * 10's power minus nine multiplied by 10's power 9 This cancels your answer - 1.4 seconds My younger brothers and sisters, did you understand this or not and if not then I will explain it again. Look here carefully your total hundredth percent destruction the hundredth percent.How many instructions are the total? Hundred percent of the instructions are of branch type. They are of branch type in which you have to eat two stalls, in which you have to eat friends, the remaining 80% is your normal. Normal means that they are being executed in overlap manner in pipe planning. They are being executed in overlap manner as if they are being sequential, due to them, you have to eat zero stalls.Because of the post, you are not getting any extra store. Have you understood? How much total stool will you eat? Sir, in 80%, if you give zero plus two in 20%, then you will have to eat the total. But instruction 0.5, which I have written in this manner, have you understood what I have said? Look, it is the sense of the times, so I am explaining in a short shortcut, but please, if you have not understood, write it down, make it crystal clear.Whatever is your heart, please fast, after this, if you also want to read a very lovely topic, then children, you will get the answer to this in 1.4 seconds. By now, you all must have understood what the poet wants to say. Sometimes he wants to say something like, brother, your normal is done in overlapping banners, but if this type of instructions come, if give branch type instructions, very good Tapan, if give branch type instructions, give yours.How many stalls will you have to eat, how much will you have to eat, and when will you know where the target address is available, this will be given in the question - 1, if branch penalty is A, then how much was the average, earlier because of 1, but now how much will it be, how much will it cost, instructions on OnePlus number of stalls, it seemed like an instruction * cycle type, I have understood till now, look, you don't have to do anything, I tell youThen tell me it is due to the done branch operation, so due to this, now I have to execute this 4000 rupees but I had brought it, so what is that process called, what is that process called? I understood it very well, so son, write it in the chat box, every child please, then they will be called unwanted instructions, they will have to be removed, what is that process called, flash or freeze them, because of them, I will stall, this is a cycle race whichThose stalls will come as per their technical call, I call branch penalty, so how will I know when it will come, I will know at which stage I am getting it, if I have to know at the second stage whether I have to go next or not, then one more if the address is at the third stage, then two, Sir, how many are there, multiply their frequency, then you will get the instruction on install on average, but the instruction will be given to you, if on average is clear, then the average instruction will come.What will be your execution timing?
OnePlus number of instruction in cycle time till now is crystal clear to all the children and father kya no sir son if there is any doubt then ask children h and everyone if there is any doubt please ask quickly but whatever you do now listen you know how good is the performance of planning divided by how good is the performance of non pipe and do you know what we know sir we do not know ourselves what do we know is the performance which is inversely proportionalIf it is the exhibition time then what will be the speed factor of * cycle time in pipeline. If you have understood my point till now, then how will you write in the pipeline along with the install, this cycle time and here how much it becomes is yours. You know and if you say that the cycle time of both is equal then what will go to the instruction on cycle / instruction on OnePlus install or do you use the formula instead of this when it is taking equal amount of time or maybe less.Good morning, it is crystal clear son. Whenever I say crystal clear, yes no sir, I get confused. When the cycle is taking time, then what do you say about speed off factor? Pipeline death, if uniform is perfectly balanced, upon OnePlus stores it is called instruction, I go into full details, but now you are so reduced, how much child are you okay to install, son and lap bless you, instruction on number off, what is the branch?Frequency is 25% due to which two are being seen then average how much is 0.5 how much is 0.5 and when I told you when perfectly balanced what is pipeline OnePlus my younger brothers and sisters make crystal clear heart thank you maybe thank you Shahid Khan Allah has kept very good child lap bless yes yes good morning now suniyega performance pipeline processor Safar's number of thousand sleepers when K plus van instruction himD result dependency yes the education of condition is all of given that this is structural dependency my dear now listen control haijors what are control haijors in control ledger I told you also non further branch hazards branching wale instruction when akkar suniyega sahib carefully suniyega carefully suniyega pipeline make wrong decision on branch prediction how did you do what iPhone what take buffer branch test delay branch all these techniques he didAll these techniques are done for them. Children have you understood? Children, do this question. Do this question quickly. Do this quickly. This is a very fake question. This is a very fake question. Hurry up. There is a sense of time. I only want to say this. Hurry up. 1.5 Here, how much TV is there in one? One was 1.1. Son, 3 whose time is less, its frequency is more. Son, its frequency is more. One, its frequency is more. Do this question.The question is such a big question that the child goes to the door, okay, take a screenshot of it from home, you bring it, otherwise I will get it done in it, whatever the knowledge is, do it son Shahid Khan, whose time is less, his frequency is less, are you, output dependency from the getting point, take a screenshot of it, I will get it done, don't worry, this is my promise and I will remember it, I am going to do it in the pic series, okay now see what is anti and output dependency.Anti and output, no problem son, there is anti and output dependency, now suniyega children, carefully suniyega, take the main i1 with you, add r0 R1 r2 3 4 56 78 and take it here son, this is very easy to do, see, it is very easy, you take a screenshot and try it once friend, if not then still tell me in the last, I will do it, okay son, as long as you are learning, there is no problem, but let me know, look, if I forget, let me know.First of all, I say sorry in advance, if I forget, then it is okay to tell now. See what is happening here, understand my point, R1 plus r2 is going into r0, 80 - r4 / r6 is going into r3, and R7 is multiplying into r3. Now I am going to learn you, one is the concept of anti-dependence, the concept of dependency, the concept of output dependency, the concept of output dependency. Have you seen till now?Ho true, what was the meaning of data dependency when the result of the next instruction is given to it daily, what do I know son, where is your brother Nishu, I am in the studio, look here, children will learn.
Children will learn, you will learn, you look here, my little brothers and sisters, you can see here, whatever you are, is not dependent on whom, nor is that dependent on you, you can see here, whatever you are, is dependent on i1. Listen, this is my point, one thing, how will be your exhibition sequence, i1 I2 I3 iPhone, which is the concept, understanding the concept of I1, what you are, is dependent on i1, depending on i1, understanding a very lovely thing, now this pen.Keep a copy, every child suniyega, what does he want to say, sometimes what does he want to say, sometimes he is very smart, what does the poet want to say, sometimes I am not there, sometimes this is the concept, isn't it you yet, you data is crystal clear, first do one knowledge once, all the children do one knowledge, till now all the children till here it is crystal clear, see, I will teach you a very sweet thing, today's class will definitely give two marks questions, I am sure that if you listen carefully, two to three marks can also be given to three.It can be of four, it can be of atleast you are of marks, it will definitely happen, I am giving the guarantee in writing, or else you are still sleeping, only two things can happen, the game of output dependency, look here, what is happening, I have this instruction, i1, I2, I3, i4, I have this structure, so what is happening in this type, please understand tree, you understand only friend, I, you depend on I van, I, you depend on I van my.Dear a depend because of i tu him d result of i van friend i tu him d i tu him d result of i van result of i1 friend so due to dependency i tu tu what will you wait what will happen due to wait practical example will not be able to be done and when i tu is not executed then i3 and i4 will also not be able to execute then the ego of i3 and i4 will get hurt they will say we should wait when ourIf there is no mistake then why should we wait? When there is no mistake of ours, then understand, understand, understand. For example, take a man in your class, whether it is about school time or college time. In your class, understand my point. In your class, a child did some newshunt activity, did something mischievous, did anything, whatever it is, did some damage to the college property or school property. Your respected teacher came, he said, tell me who did it, tell me who.Otherwise, I will suspend the entire class for seven days, call everyone's parents or I will fine everyone, then what do you say, in some time, something happens like going to the teacher's side, sir, you know it is not our fault, why are you blaming us, at least tell me the name, sir, look, Mukesh sir, this Vinod has done it, sir, I have not done it, sir, Vinod has done the point, he is doing the same thing with suniyega, played here.Are you doing it? I2 is doing it. Result of i1 is doing it. I2 is doing it. Result of i1 is doing it. I2 is doing it. Result of i1. That's why he is dependent. That's why he is dependent. I understand son. Everyone is understanding. Because of this he is dependent. Now he is dependent so he won't be able to go to be executed. So I came when I didn't go to be executed. Hey, look here children, when I came, you were the only one.I did not go to execute when I came, you are here only i1 i1 i1 When I came, you are not dependent on me, when I came, you will not go here, I3 will not be able to go, nor will it go only after this, and what is recording, what is happening, ego of I3 and iPhone is hurt, what are you saying, you are traveling and you are not dependent on others i1 and I2, sir, why should I travel because neither I am dependent on you, my name is on i1If dependent, then what do we do, we reschedule it, what do we reschedule, we run it out of order execution, we run out of order execution, what do we do in it, out of order execution in it, first execute independent instruction, first independence instruction, so what will I do, I will drive the van to I3, what will happen to the iPhone when I come, you will come to her by the time,Offend will be available when I come and you will come, he will be available to operate by the time neither he will have to wait nor we will have to wait. Do you understand what I am saying? Have you ever heard, listen carefully, see what is happening here, my younger brothers and sisters, what is happening here in this question I2 Which children video?
Please like this question I2 depends on i1 on I2 depends on i1 pe to aayi tu jab execute ho jaana nahi jaaye until i1 gets finished so date reason i tu will wait and this waiting create stalls but when i true will not go for education dene i3n i for also not go for education dene i3 and i4 se ki sir wahi si have tu wait wahiC have you wait C are not dependent and else on I van and I you than C will not wait so what C will do C execute independent instruction first you can say C trying you execute out of order execution out of order education last mein challenge beta sambse last mein challenge clear bachcha good morning Dinesh good morning like this video session also now suniyega children now itsThe reason is that I have two dependencies, one is anti, one is output, please please, which is anti dependency, which is anti dependency, when you run it like this, when you run it like this, my younger brothers and sisters, anti dependency which will come, anti dependency will come between your I3 and I2. Sir, what is that, I will tell you and output dependency will come between iPhone and iPhone, now you will learn my words suniyega, look carefully, it is very important.Have asked the question twice, listen to what the child wanted to say, should I ever drink water, then tell me what is the matter? One second, look at this question carefully, NTR, look at the output carefully, look at the ant and output carefully, see, I taught you that till now you had read true data dependency, when the resource result operand is like i, it is between i, tu and i1, I am going to learn the dependency, tu moti pregnancy, ok children, if you understand.Now look here, what I had, they always say sequential order, you are dependent on the result of i1, so there is data dependency between I2 and i1, so for this reason, for this reason, I you I you I you I you I you I you not I you instruction number i1 till the completion of i1 so this waiting create extra cycle so these cycles of this share I3 and iPhone I3 and iPhone also will not be able to execute then I3 and iPodDo you know what you will say on the side, just like you say to the teacher, Sir, Vinod has done something, Vinod has done something, even if it is not my fault, then I3 and i4 will also say, Sir, I are not dependent on each other, i1 and I2, give A C, you have journey, please take this matter seriously, Sir, take this matter seriously, Sir, give what C do C execute out of order execution out of order execution for example.Very Good Very Good There is no problem with this but it will cause problems, it will not install, any install gets terminated due to out of order execution, but there is a problem in the result, there is a problem in the result, there is a problem in the result, how now see what is anti dependency, what did I say, first you ran I3 and then you are running Aai Tu, so what is happening, I said, go and understand everything H and everyone Shweta son understand Dinesh understand everything children.Prashant, first you run I3, when you first run I3, you write the updated value of R for before it is read, this is what happened, I told you to go, you will get ₹ 8 lakh in the bank, you go, in the same way, I will get 8 lakh, I will give it to him, if there was ₹ 8 lakh on it, if I have sent you saying 8 lakh and if I have already performed some operation in it, now it is possible that you may not get 8 lakh.You got ₹ 50000 Are you getting my point means to say come here 2 which is I2 I was reading the initial value of r4 Hey whatever the value was I take the value of r for was 50 but what did it do now wait what did it update so it is not able to read the initial so the person who promised him ₹ 8 lakh went wrong date this is the meaning of anti dependency say in the lineI am understanding, I have also brought it forward, I am speaking the lines in the form of theory, understanding, anti-dependency, create, Hindi pipe lining, when, when, when, the next instruction, try, write the data, when the next instruction, when, the next structure. Previous reader, before you read, I had written this called anti-dependency and output dependency, meaning of output, output dependency, meaning of output. Brother said, output means output, what is output?Dependency is next inst
Operation try you write date of before previous writing before previous write it is understood children and output means see sequentially it was discussed that first i1 will chaliyega then I2 then I3 then i4 first I will write then you will write. I have understood but now what is happening first this is writing then this is writing then son your final value will be wrong you will get it too.Look at the solution, see what you did, first I ran the I van, ran the I3, ran the iPhone, ran the iPhone, ran the solution, got whose results, stored them in the buffer, stored them in the buffer, and as soon as I came, after the completion of I, you said, the dependent instruction update D buffer content in you register will come, it would have gone even after reducing its i1, then you will not have to read the story of dependency, but it is better to do it because of these.Two more dependencies have been created, one is anti and one output. Son, what does anti mean? Before reading your value, I have written it. This is called anti dependency here, what are you seeing, what are you seeing, sir, tell me what are you seeing, what are you seeing, tell me, what are you seeing here, what are you seeing here, which is the value of R4, before reading it, it has written it. If you run I3 first, then the second is the output dependency. Output.My younger brothers and sisters, you are seeing in the dependency. In the output dependency, you are seeing that first the iPhone is riding, before it is written, before it is written, then it has become my output dependency, but due to these, it never gets installed. Children, if you have understood then please write a heart in the chat box because of these, it never gets installed. The result will start producing wrong, that first this value is getting updated, then this is happening, then its sequence is getting broken, then itsSolution A: We will store the result of the one out of order in the buffer. We will execute I3 and i4 but instead of updating it in the register, we will store it in the buffer and as soon as i tu is finished, as soon as i tu is finished, I2 says, then the dependent instruction will be finished. Give, we will store the contents of the buffer in the register file. Till now all the children have understood, very good, very good. Now look here, a question has come.Will you read in the question, won't you solve the whole question first, won't even read what are you saying R I R K R K you mean the operation is not yours but our over power i.e. R1 has r2 plus r3 R7 multiply r3 r4 plus r4 Jas son yes till now the place is clear, now what has ever happened Anti dependency between I you and I5 If you schedule it, reschedule it, you reschedule it, then I2And is there anti between I2 and I5? Is there anti between I2 and I5? Is it new? Is it output? Sir, the output is not visible to you. R7 R7 output is not output. Sir, this is wrong. Anti dependency between I2 and iPhone. Yes sir, this is correct and the entry dependency in the instruction pipeline is always create zero and more stall or van and more stall. Not son. To remove anti and output dependency install, remove the storage.To do this, the result dependency is eliminated, but the result is not accurate. I had found the solution to store my out of order execution person in the offer, so only h2 is true marks 2015 point. I start the point. First you write till here. Is it crystal clear in the chat box? Is it crystal clear for all the children, all the children have written, all the children have written, everyone, everyone, tell me, fast, fast, everyone, one more thing, till now I have understood.Aye look, half India is right, half India is confused, half India is confused, we read it wrong, so I see, you have understood a shortcut, it is okay, what is the fight, here too, it is right, this is my output dependency and which other girl is true data dependency, understood Shiva, just wait, Shiva Shiva today, started it on D16, 15, 31st and believe me, got a lot of love from you people, thank you from the bottom of my heart.No, thank you very much and what is the meaning of love here? What is the meaning of love? I am here for you. Great response. Children gave answers to questions. Children were on time in such cold. I know brother, even in such cold, you people are on time. Some are late by one and a half minute. It is a different matter, some are half late. Sometimes even the office is late.
It happens that you all have your own reasons too, but you gave a very good response and believe me, I also tried my best, you had maximum crash course, you had 3 hours of time, look, I keep the watch switched off, I keep it hidden here, so I have tried to give you the best content, still if anything is left, then children, please please see the condition also. See what year it was today, if you walk wearing a jacket in the summer, then only a shirt will not work in the winter.If you walk wearing it then it will not work, walk in tension is a different matter but it will not work because the condition is different, the condition is different, the condition is different, if you say that the month of January is about to start, Happy New Year in advance to everyone, they will do it later, isn't it, the month of January is about to start, plus there is a crash course, time is short, even after that, we have to fight and live and follow the same line that there is darkness in the sky and where is the lighting of the lamp supposed to be, the understood thing is correct.Whatever happens, it will be good, thank you Nishu, thank you, zero point, thank you, thank you, thank you. Now suniyega, children, I am teaching you, you already know that you are trying it, see what is this instruction modification, instruction modify the register and memory location and the next one, the next one, the next one, the next one, see the location of the next one, when will there be dependency, when will there be dependency, when will the first one be modified?And if the second one is reading, then read the second one, read the second one, then there will be no dependency, the problem will be reduced when Hazard Sugar, keep this in mind, Shiva had asked himself, if read takes place before write operation, like what does he want to say, sometimes here is a very good child, sometimes he wants to say that brother, sometimes this child is from here, there is no problem like this, Baba, I have no problem like this, but when will the problem come, when will the problem come, when aWhen the next one will go, which is the next one, Successive, what I am saying is Successive, start reading first, before I write, and this is what happens, this is what happens in parallel execution in pipe lining, he did not write before that, you bring him and you put R1, start it, it is okay for execution, war war son, look carefully at anti-dependency, fit anti-dependency in your mind.Fit it, what was it, son, it wrote it first, there will be a problem in the initial rate before reading it, instruction read, this register and memory location is a good thing and the next structure, the next instruction, the next instruction, wants to write that register, what is the next instruction to that register, what is the use of that register ever, the next structure wants to write that register, Haija Sarkar i.e. Shiva before you read, crystal clear like water, crystal clear like water, before you read, I write.When I get cut, it will be created that if my write is happening in reverse order, what is the meaning of reverse order, first iPhone is writing, give I, you are writing, while what should happen, I, Van, I, I, a question of 3 marks came, you were asked to tell Ra, tell Ra, tell war, and tell that, tell Ravan, hurry up, practice question, Mr. Chahiye sir, son will bring, thank you children, love you all my dear students heart.From the depth of my younger brothers and sisters, thank you, Shweta, son Nishu, thank you, thank you, everyone, thank you, how much dependency is happening here, look here, one, two, three, four, how many more nights are coming, and only one is coming and the war is coming, look here, one is here, till here everyone is crystal clear, till here the place is clear for everyone, all children till here, it is crystal clear, so write Happy New Year, God bless you and happy.New Year my dear student and God bless you all, New Year for you people, may you stay healthy, stay happy, stay busy, yes yes yes 422 Hey son, it is crystal clear, write it down, now I am going to teach you a very lovely topic, what is the specialty of this topic, the specialty of this topic is that even the place is clear, now see next, we will talk in the evening, now what do I want to tell you, I will tell you who is here sometime, don't you see children, let's first read a little shroud.Ever wanted to say, now what I am going to learn from you is floating point representation, what is floating point representation, why am I teaching you this?
To understand, first of all, you will also see the headline of the schedule, I was the first one to learn DMA, I was the first one to learn DMA, among them many times the question of Van Mark is so easy that you can do it without studying, you can do it even without studying, but these days, keep listening Disclaimer, these days, it is in fashion these days, like many times friend set was made in 2020, it came in both the seats, in 2021, it came for two marks, in 2022, it came for two marks.Came and this question is very good, it is very similar, it is very cheap, for 2 marks, Jai Siya Samarjeet Correct, you have to learn a good concept from numerical point of view and even if you come less than yourself and get two marks, then I have done a little smart work in this. Understand, don't say like this to me sir, I got this done, not that, I am also bringing second memory, but I gave it priority first, protein powder because H and every year you get marks.This question is coming up these days, so I hope it will come to you too, and the biggest thing is that if you do not have any knowledge about it, absolutely zero, zero knowledge, blue but silence, you do not know sir, what is the meaning of floating, what is implicit, explicit, what is exponent, what is what is not, blah blah blah blah blah, exactly zero to samjhaunga and I will not say this thing, you will say that Han Sir, please explain the protein in very basic manner.There is no problem, bring questions and believe me, after the end of today's class, after the end of your class, you will be able to ask all the get questions of these questions, so till here, first of all, please like the number of people who are live now, there are not that many likes, you children come to listen to me, here you send big hearts in the chat box, listen to me, don't feel bad, I am only talking about myself, here you areBig hearts, crystal clear, legendary teacher in the chat box, I told you the same thing brother, do write in the comment box as well, if the video gets uploaded, I feel more happy when I read in the comment box, who is writing what in the chat box, sometimes I miss it, but I try to understand the whole number system, what has played with it, although you have learned in digital electronics, data format, what son format, data format, son data format, if you have two, then fixed point data, one floating point.The character in this is A B C D I, I am not doing it, isn't it? Magnitude format is a complement format. Even in magnitude, your one is unsint, there is a sign and in complement too, Vansh is a complement and so he has to be complemented. In this, you have to come, forget your own. Now this is fine. What is the range of unsint? What is the range of unsint, power of n - 1 from zero to power of 2, n - 1, if it is of 4 beats.Zero to 15 Hey how much can you write in four beats Sir 16 Have you ever written 16 From zero to 15 Is it written on the side There will be -7 from seven Please please seven You always You always do not do it in lineage complement or sign magnitude representation Why do you always do twist complement? Is there any reason Yes sir because in lineage complement and in this one, there is redundant representation of zero in both, there are zeros in both.My dear, both of them have red end representation of zero. Both of them have zero representation. Are you understanding what I am saying and what will happen in the complement? Minus eight to plus seven. Try zooming in and later it will go from zero to 15. 123456 As soon as you know MC beat is MC most significative beat what children most significative beat if your van is more significant beat your ifVan is the more significant beat. If your van is van, then what will be your sign? Negative, so I have gone from 0 to minus seven. This is from zero to this and this is what Vansh complement is Vansh complement. Do you know how to come out?Wants to say sometimes wants to say that vansh complement and some complements have presentation of zero 10 here is zero given my India what are what does jab hi to sometimes say what does jabhi sometimes say do you do that you do that what do you do that complement do that then complement now I am going to learn you that floating point
Why do we do the representation? After that, I will teach it from the very basic. From the very basic, it means that darkness is Ghana. It means that darkness is Ghana. Yes, Nishu, very good. That is what I am saying. And where is it meant to light a lamp? I will teach it from the very basic. Those children, who guess in floating point, say one line and it will be confirmed. The child, who guesses in floating point, does not even know the spelling of floating point. Again, I repeat in floating point.It seems that the child doesn't even know the spelling of shorting point. After watching today's video, whether he is listening to me live or he is listening to me on record, he will give me blessings from the heart, I know that blessings will come out from the heart for your sir, I love you from my heart, a fund is as crystal clear as water, like water. We studied but the rate remained the same for us, when to keep it positive and when negative, I know where the child gets stuck in this, where does the child face difficulty in conversion?When do children actually get exponent of exponent? What is this disease? I know where the child will attack. Time is less but what did I do? I troubled our typist people. You think, I will tell one thing to one person, I will take 1 minute. You know, I have time for your class tomorrow. So son, today you will say this by 11:00 am. Sir, now you will start getting scared of the protein point. Will you ever get punished? Now each and every thing is as crystal clear as water and believe me.At 11:00 in the night I had called the typist and at 11:00 a PPT of floating point came to me. Just imagine at 11 in the night, for one of your classes, our DP operators who are type paste and proof reading people are taking any money from you, aren't they? Only what is needed is children's love, what is needed is children's love, for today's class at 11:00 in the night, you are not lying, you can confirm, I can show you the screenshot.I can say that this PPT has come at 11:00 am, I cross-checked it once again, made arrangements and it has been run till 12:01 am in the night. Do you understand that you are not only the faculty for one class, the entire DP operator, the studio operator, the typist team, the roof reading team, all of them are doing less and I and this branch is not getting less, this team Dronaka, for every faculty, every DP operator is doing all these things for you.It's not like brother, what he does on this thing is visible. Son, are you understanding? Now look, I will teach you floating point one by one from basic. I know many of you must have already studied this in B.Tech. Even in B.Tech, there will be no doubt from anywhere. Yes, I will not say this, you will say. Okay, now I will start talking about floating point in the first place, why do we study floating point, how to study, they will learn all those things, please please suniyega.What is floating point representation son? Why do you read floating point representation? If you do it in fixed notation then you can represent positive and wait negative number but it should be nearest to zero or a little centerise but if I have a very big number. If I have a very big number or a very small number in fractions then son you can call it floating point representation.You will be able to represent only with 16 beats, you will not be able to do it and take an example, your number is of 16 beats, how much can you write with 16 beats, how much can you write with 16 beats, how much can you write with 16 beats, son, your power is 1655, you can write this much, right, but if I have to store even 61000, then I will not be able to store it with 16 beats because what is this D range - 32K to plus 32K.If the mines reach up to one, then we do floating point representation, we do it. Son, we do floating point representation. For this thing, either there is big data or there is a very small amount of data which gets cluttered in less memory. For this, we do our 14 presentation, that is, if my data is till infinity, then I will do it right now and even if it is till zero.Even if it is crystal clear till now, I will do it. Till now you have understood my point. If you have understood my point till now, then I will start my game. Write it in the chat box. If it is crystal clear till now, believe me, you will enjoy it. I will teach you from the very basic. What is Bye Singh, I will teach you why do we normalize, I will teach you what is big A and small I.
Ta is A for big apple i.e. small A4 is small capital A4 big apple is not like this son or A is for apple b is for big apple not like this son, we will teach you all here suniyega What is the general syntax of floating point, what is it, you will get this but first I will teach you small only and this is big A, this is big A, first I will teach you only small, then I will tell you why there is a need for big i, why is there a need to understand above the need, why is this thing necessary, you will get many places like thisYou will get the sign like this, that is not your Bachelor of Engineering. That is, you are not a Bachelor of Engineering. Look carefully. Close the comment box. Close the comment box. Two children. Please close the comment box. Please close the comment box. Right now I am talking about you only learn either in many places you will get like this, in many places you will get this. Okay, there will be no confusion in life. You learn by exponents and m. How much of my point would you have understood and what would I do in general?I am capital A, I do it in this capital or do you speak like this, this is the format, melon will be cut and will be divided as you say, melon will be cut and will be divided as you say, don't worry, this will be mine, it will tell you the meaning, or it will tell you in the access code, the exponent is of so many beats, this is of so many beats, this is that, so and so, dhigana, everything, so don't take tension, now this capital I sir, I have not told yet how this virus comes out.Can break half of India Yes I am saying half of India is confused Sir when we shift the video neither will it come in power plus nor in mines but I guaranteed that after today neither power plus nor power will fit directly in the mind suniyega just keep this in mind what do you want to say sometimes this is my format this is capital A and one you have played in small A also one you have played in small A also first I will teach small I firstSmall A I will teach then capital A I will teach you to understand my point and how to represent anything in your floating point Something Something * Power of 2 Small represents like this What is this lesson called mine Mental This is my small You can do the same with 10 You are the only one in your gate Okay stop now son stop son is wrong no auspicious is wrong this is right now suniyega till placeIt is clear that I am winning my victory again. I am again requesting everyone with folded hands. If you want depth in this concept, please keep the PAN copy in the chat box only when I ask. Just keep acknowledging and rest of the useless talk, do not talk like 'Haan son, what a stir did you eat? Come on, don't do anything like this. Is it okay? What do you say or capital I, whose value is Spice? What is q0 per, I will tell you, M ismentasha Sir, how is this represented? Plus and minus, this will represent the sin and 0.11.3 Something, which one will I tell you? Mention, Tu Tu's power, till here the venue is clear, till here the venue is clear, learn as you explain, first learn the alphabet, then words, then English, then sentences, everything will be found. Now listen, I told you this, does SIM remain S, my sign will remain beat, I will remain my exponent and mine will remain mental.Now I have understood, look here either in the format plus or minusAnd this one here's meaning is here's meaning, this one's meaning is 16, if I have to write 6.5, then I will know, only only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only for me, I have to get this bitcoin done here, I have to set it, everyone has understood till now, look now, I will teach you a very sweet thing, very sweet, learn peacefully, no shouting.Shanti and tell me, you will emerge as a master, see, but how to represent yourself, power of 2, in something, neither what am I doing, what am I doing, suniyega, what am I doing, what am I doing, 2^ plus, whenever you write online, align, write, it is power, it is the power of you, which is positive, see children, there are many children.
There is confusion and this is proof, I have got proof of this in many places, many children get confused. Align right means this point was here, right here, what did you do by shifting the right here, online right, how many beats did you shift, 1 2 3 1 2 3, if you shifted the beat, then how much will it be? Power of 2 plus, I understood till now, if you knew before, then don't make heart and if you didn't know, then make your power.Plus Tu Ki Power Plus Question Answer Answer Question from Answer Whenever you get confused, you can do it like this You have understood my point The pistol is clear Now look here Now look here The one who has come here is a small A How much will it be called Three This lesson is mine What will be called 11001 And what will be called the sign beat here Because the number is positive then what will the sign be called Zero So my younger brothers and sisters youHow will you write 3 How will you write 11 01 Till here the place is clear Till here it is crystal clear It's fun Look I have promised I will tell you one thing from basic I will tell you one thing from the basics Friend who teaches this 64.5 There should never be any tension sir Should I add plus or minus in this If I write online then it is positive Sir If I forgot the meaning of online write I brought it here And your right or my right is thisIf you are taking me here, then if I have less time in the exam and I have to check a million times that instead of the plus I have done, there will be minuses instead of plus, is it right or wrong, no one teaches all this, everyone thinks you are educated, I also consider you educated but I told you, I will teach you from the basics, they tell you all this, you know it and you tell me to save your respect, let's go ahead, we know it, but what happens in reality, many children do not know.It is a fact that many children do not know this thing and also this thing, half of their life is spent in finding their combination, many children are not even able to write, I should write 21 points, 75 have to be written, they too are not able to write, so children, after today there should never be any confusion, I have done the next question of 6.5, whose question of 6.5, you have to do it, do my thing for 4.5, you have taken the best son, do 4.75, you also have to do 4.5 and4.75 also has to be done. Look, right now I am going with Chhota A and am going with Chhota A. Now I am going to convert it into Base Tu after some time son. Everyone has the number in Base Tu given in decimal. I am going to convert it into Base Tu and am going. Well, I have written the best Tu here. I am going to convert it into Base Tu and am going. This is what I am talking about. Have you understood the point? Now you have to do these questions 4.5 and 4.75. Hurry up my little one.Brothers and sisters, M, small A will do, now small A, yes, yes, everyone, have fun, lack of time, 4.5 and 4.75, then I will tell you why there is a need for capital I, now look, I am writing small A everywhere and in the format, I said while coming, big I will do, why will it do, I will tell you the reason for it, we will read each and every thing with reason, it is not that sir said to study, brother said to do, look here, this 4.5The answer is 1234. There is no need to take tension ever. Tu ki power 2 plus 2 ki power mines van four point five aur point 75 a gaya hai to make a heart, write in the chat box, till now you have understood. Increment d exponent and left alignment increment d exponent. If when you do right alignment, then the exponent will be plus in the beat, how much will be plus.It will work sir, how will you remember, how will you remember, then you will keep progressing, I have kept the same point on this data, whether these three data were shifted here or shifted to the side, it became plus three A and I had also told this by taking the proof, your again was 6.5 A, son, left alignment, when this one remains, this one remains, this one remains, when there is a problem, such numbers come, no, when all the pluses and minuses are lost in your mind, take it here, take it here, then plus will come.Mines will come and numbers come like this, children, learn how many beats I am shifting left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 I am writing in 1.73. I am doing 8 beats. How many plus fives were there before? How many will be there now? If plus five mines come then the answer is A. Your power of 2 is mine and left alignment is crystal clear. It comes but no one tells everyone. Tell me quickly. Reply in the chat box. You do the next question.001 Do something, children, every child, do it quickly, if I shift digital to the right, if I shift digital, if I
If I am shifting the digital to the right side, then my power will be positive. If the power positive point is zero, then how much would have come, how much would have been minus seven. Because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 I understood that it was off. There was no change. Son, the sign remains a sign, na Dada sign S tells whom S tells whom S tells whom S tells this, son, the sign of power changes with plus or minus. There was nothing in the power here, there was nothing in the power here.Then your power became plus three because you had shifted right. You had shifted right. Son, you had shifted right. Look, the sign was positive, it is positive, it will remain positive and it has also been told that it is positive, only the power changes. Earlier, the power was zero here, so your power became plus three. I am shifting it to +3 here too. It has become +3 here, I am shifting it by 3 beats. I am pulling it here, it is clear now.Next question, do this one. Next question do this one. When do you have to do left and right alignment? I will tell you, then I will tell you. First learn your ABCD, learn ABCD, then learn your alphabet, learn word meaning, learn everything. Ok brother, you will learn everything. Please, please, please take the number you want to represent. If S is yours, this will be of 1 beat, this will be yours of 4 beats, accept this and this is yours.Mention will be of five minutes, you have to write like this brother, thank you sir, look from here, you solve this question, please reply. I am going to give you a very lovely concept that why was there a need for Bade I? Why was there a need for Bade? To understand this question, please be from India, from wherever it is, it is good. Now read here, I don't want to shift this point here, what will happen to the piece in 1001 and what will happen to I -2 -2.What does -2 mean? What will be the negative number? If A is my negative. If I give it negative. What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do?This A is gone, so my answer is A is my van van zero van and here two zeros till now I understood my point suniyega I ask you two-three questions, what dream will come to you that this is 14 -2, this is 14, you must be sitting with a simple question that the exponent of your A is of four beats, your A which is small, A which is small, A which is of four beats, it can be of 4 beats, power.It is a very big number, I had to listen to it again, my meat, don't get busy with your words, then why am I talking to you? Look here, what am I talking about, Sir, I will repeat the left alignment and give it. My video was buffered. Hemant Soni will definitely do it. Son, if it is such a thing, then listen. First of all, what is this alignment? What is this alignment disease? Understand my point. Okay, tell me one thing. Modi ji has some protocols, less PM of any post of any state or any other.Everything has some rules. Everything has some rules. Understand my point, Hemant Soni. There are some protocols that brother, you will be like this, you have to do this, you have to do that, you also have some protocol, before the semester exam, your registration form will be filled, then you will attend the class, then you will be mid-term, then your admit card will come, then you will go to give the exam, then you will get the result, so there is some process or some protocol. Similarly, what is the meaning of alignment?In floating point, you can write any number in two ways, not by raising your mouth and writing it anywhere, no matter how you write it, you can write it in two ways, either 0.1 something or 1.0. It has to be written in this way. This is called Seat and Expensive Normalization, which I am not teaching right now. Now you understand what is alignment, why was there a need for alignment, we needed alignment because we have to give them a format.Because we had to bring them in one format, either we will bring them in this format or we will bring them in this format, or we will bring them in this format, or we will bring them in this format, if I take mine is like this, it is like this, then mine, mine, mine, you have to bring it in the form of 0.1 i.e. what do I get after the point, what do I get after the point, what will I get after the point, if I get van, then what will I do, will I keep the point here, will I shift it here, then how many beats will I shift the point?happening
Hai beta kitni 1 2 3 123 to yeh a jaayegi tu ki power plus [Music] Zero van in tu ki power plus tu Now what do you have to do, what do you have to do, what do you have to do, what do you have to do, what do you have to do, what do you have to do, do you have to shift left, I will not take this number as a light number, but I have to make this number laptop 1234511015 Swift, I have shifted my point to the left, so this is it, now look in this example, you see, although I had given the wrong data which is there.That's why I have raised, you understand from here, why I took it wrong, I will tell him, although that answer is also correct, but the value of the point is implicit and wrong according to the MP seat, look here, 110, what do you have to shift, this point was here, if you have to shift here, then plus three A is gone, is A gone, plus three is crystal clear, crystal clear. Now see what you have to do, in which format you have to come. If you want to bring it in 1.0 1 format, then what you have to do is this.If you have to take me here till the van, then how many beats will it take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 likhiyega to 1.0 1 * First your power is plus five, now here your power minus will be eight because you have done Allen left, so 1.0 1 * Power of 2 plus five minus is crystal clear, all the children till now look at what Khela wants to say, sometimes this wants to say, till now till now yourThe exponent which is small i is small a, the one with power was a positive a, the one with power was a positive a, but here my i became negative a and you know whenever my number goes negative a, what do I do, I reach to take this compliment, so first I wrote tu ko, compliment came out so it became 14 which I had to write in 4 beats 4I had to write in beat 1, what did I do, what did I do, I wrote it in beat 4, 1110, till now the place is clear, till now all the children write the channel, now you are going to ask a lot of questions in the chat box and you will also do it at the gate, and today after the end of the class, you guys do all the questions. Archit, very good morning son, very good morning, so listen, Apna Capital I, now from here we need Capital A, which is called Apna.A Plus Wireless Why do you know what problem you are having here? When my I is negative A. When my I is negative A. When my I is negative A, I am trying to get a twist complement. So I am playing a blood. I am playing a blood. What is this number?How many people, 14, then what will you say? Whatever is the power ofWhich my younger brothers and sisters is your actual exponent, if it is negative, if it is negative then what will you have to do and you will have to take tool complement and write down its value but I will be confused whether this is my normal data or tuescomplement of some value. If you have understood, then come and understand my point.If -2 comes -2 then what will I do, I took it or everything is going on small till now, but how can I remain big in writing, I took it till here, then I come Bye Leo, what is the meaning of Bye Leo, what is the meaning of Bye Leo, what is the meaning of debt, convert negative number into positive number, you must have read at many places, you must have heard that we do recovery because I also start straight, why do we do bye, what is its full form, why was there a need to take capital A when my name is less thanIt was going on, why was it needed sir, if it has gone full A, then write so that I can move ahead, please tell me fast, do it quickly, friend, this much is enough, I have not even started floating point yet, so I have taught you the basic number system, how what is what, what is not, what is all that stuff. So bye Singh, what is an approach? An approach is a method in which whether my A comes positive or negative, whether positive comes or negative comes, I give it in a format.I will change it so that I don't have to remain confused that sir, this is 14, this is 14, this is 14, this is 14 sir or this is -2.
I will end this confusion, I will normalize it, I will learn my plotting point representation, my game starts, now my game starts, now I am teaching you, please keep the pen copy [music] Your typing status, which was yours - 2 A, okay, so now what will we do first, we will normalize that, whom will we normalize first, we will normalize our exponent, okay look here.You will get the value of byers from the mines van of power of 2. What is the K of the body? Your exponent weight is this. This is your let's four beats or I am zooming in. I am Adam, is it four beats? Is it four beats? Arjun reason. Thank you child. Thank you lap bless you son. D number of exponent for example. If my K exponent is of 4 beats then how much will be the byers. 2 ki.What is meant by saying power four minus van i.e. power three i.e. eight, sometimes it wants to say that sometimes it wants to say that now I will add A plus A plus eight in the capital A so that my exponent which is the exponent gets normalized. Now I have taught the exponent to be normal so see if the exponent is of 4 beats, how many beats of 4 beats then how much can it be -2's power four minus van plus.Your power is four mines, one mine, one mine. The value can be from eight to seven. I will always be in a dilemma. I will always be in a dilemma whether this number represents a negative number in my four beats or a positive one. I ended this disease itself. What did I do, what did I do? How did I turn it into a lion? How did I do the small eye plus virus? So what did I do? What is there in every number? So whatever number comes, see if it is working.If I make a plus in everything, then I will live completely happy that I don't need to take the tension that whether my small income comes positive or negative, I have done standardization. Hey, there is standardization in anything, so I have done a standardization that now whether it comes negative or positive, I will always convert my email. It is always mine, I will convert it. If you understand the point then write a chat.In the box, we know which street we are going to, brother, we are going, we are going, this should not be so, why are we going and which street we are going, we should know that many times he gives us twenty - Axis 16 Axis 32If my exponent is of 4 beats, if my exponent is of 4 beats, then how much will be the byers? Power of 2, four mines, one of your powers is equal to three. The same is coming, my younger brothers and sisters. Tell me correctly. Concept of Akhand Vijay Sir. Mini thank you thank you Shiva children. It was fun. First, I will grow up after this. It was not fun. Look here, then you.This was the question, oh, this was the question, here I also changed the game, so how much will be the buyer's A, four, this will be given to you, son, it is always from the van, these two's bits will be given, this will be the dates of both of them, my dear, this will be given, how much is my mistake, 22 A is gone, 16 is ok, okay small i, how much was capital A. Tell me, my younger brothers and sisters, or what can you say, Beas exponent.Equal Tu Actual Expense Clear Everyone Clear Everywhere Look here children, what happened -2 + 16 how much is 14 in how many beats do I have to write these 14 in 4 5 beats two four eights and four 12 and 2 14 till now I have understood my point so what have I done zero zero and exponent 14 capital Now I will proudly say capital A and this is my mentalGaya mental kya a gaya 101 but I had to write in 4 beats so I put zero here till here it is crystal clear till here it is crystal clear. If yes then write in the chat box then I am going to start my second game where the child gets trapped. You will take all the questions without asking. I will also give you the answers. You will not need to ask. You will think that this question should have come to my mind tell me quickly.Clear very good so see what see here why do by sin I am explaining to you again why do this beijing here apna ko jo small aa
If E was found to be negative, then if I was found to be negative, then my life would be spent half of my life in confusion as to whether it is a number or toss complement of some number, okay, so let's do it, its a simple funda, now how will this virus be, if your exponent is of k beat, how many beats of k beat is it, then the value of the byers will be minus the power of 2. Just to say, does anyone ever want to say this?If your A small I tea comes negative, thank you, great Choudhary, God bless you. Why do you have converted it to small positive number, so that the confusion ends that sir, is it a virus, which is the value or is it a tool's complement of some number? First thing, second thing sir, then understand this question, where did this question go, so sir here A - 2 was A - 2 and this will give you this thing.Keep in mind, child, who are listening to me, this format will be given to you. This was given to me. S is of one beat. S is generally of one beat. Mine is of 5 beats and I have a piece of 4 beats. So son, if my exponent is of 4 beats. If my exponent is of 5 beats, then how much will be my byers? Your power is 5 - 1, power of 2 is 4 16, then my big A, small A will be + 16, that is, any of the small A's.If I have any value of small i, I have to add plus 16 to it, then this exponent of mine will be the seeding. If I have added plus 16, then my capital A has become 14. And how will you write this, you have to write it in 8-5 minutes, eight and four, 12 and 2, 14 and zero 14. I have understood it. I have written it crystal clear Tapan Ravi. For pistol, you also have zero here.If you have added it, sir, explain its meaning, till here the place is crystal clear, till now the place is clear, now listen to you, there is one more thing for you, two questions are formed in it, either I have a number given, I have a number given, and I have to ask you in this format: Question number van question, this is given to you, are you asking any value from it, okay are you asking any value from this, hey, PPT gets uploaded, son bye Singh, I told you.Didn't you tell me that it was negative, you took the compliment, so what did you do for your brother Singh, in which you change your negative number to positive and if it is positive, then it will become more positive, there is no problem, but the tension of negative is over, now listen, questions are made in two formats, how will you do it, there is a formula, I take -1 to the power of s zero.Small things come together to become big. Small things come together to become big. This is also a small creed which helps in remembering. Do many children get confused? Do you know what happens? If small then what will become [Music] This is my standard format, so how will I bring value formula from this? How will I bring value from this? Sir, I will bring value from this in such a way that this format is -1 to the power of S zero dot time in tu ki power is also there now.If I teach you, do you know what this is? Sir, I knew that bigYour power of 2, the value of mines van and capital i will be given here, the value of capital i will be given, now look, now look carefully, children, now this was my question, this was my question, look carefully children, look carefully, this question was zero, son, what was zero, son 011 000, your power of five, mines van, your power is 42, how much is yours here, 16, with so much love, oneI am teaching one thing from basic to the children, each and every thing should go inside, just keep in mind, how much is 14, how much is 14, how much is 14 bios, how much is 16, so can I write like this, how much is zero.n, how much is 102, how will I write i, the power of 102, I have the value of capital I - A, I have got the value of 14 - 16, so can I write like this, I can write angry, I can do -1 to the power of zero i.e. zero positive number 0.101Power of -2 - Power of 2, you will learn, children, power of you, how can I do this now, shift it here, do it, write two lines, make two beats, 101 * power of 2, -2 + 2, so how much is yours, 4.5 You have understood my point, you have understood my point, A
Children, yes or no, or you can do it directly like this, there is no problem, you can do it like this too, if you shift it two more beats, then two zeros and a's will go. You can do it like this too, it is clear, child, you can leave till here, you can leave till here too, do not leave further, I will also teach you further, you can leave till here too, it is crystal clear, all children, tell me, write in the chat box so that now I am going to start further, so what have I told you till now?Till now, I have taught you to normalize with small A and capital A. Son, you have to understand yourself, you have to give the whole thing, you have to understand how to do this shift, I am going to learn the next one, that's why I stopped, go and ask Ravi, get there sometime and go, children get there sometime, experience too, I know that we have to learn the next one, now look here, what does Sun want to say, never understood the meaning yet, what is the bi exponent and why do we go crazy, it's a little capital equal, you do it, now II am going to learn you that you asked whether sir should I write it in the form of 0.1 or write it in the form of one dot zero, till now I had normalized the exponent, now I am going to bring a format of mental also, see here what it is, now I am going to learn the normalization of mental but before that I need a knowledge of yours, hurry up children, please put a knowledge mental, you will be able to put floating point poet suniyega.God bless you everyone suniyega, you have two types of formats, one is explicit, one is implicit, one is explicit, one is implicit, one is express, one is implicit, one is express, one is implicit, one is express, one is implicit, one is express, one is implicit, one is express, one is implicit, one means 0.1, something is m in tu ki power is a and implicit means 1 something before point, 1 something before point.2 ^ Clear child, clear, it remains your syntax, now look here, first I am teaching you, it will be closed before the bola point in the implicit 1.3 something, there should be a van before the immediate point, look carefully, look carefully, look at the syntax of the explicit, 0.1 something, what will be the power generation value formula of yours, because 0.3 are doing it, hey, 0.97 are writing neither.Here is one, one is implicit. Now I will make the question in both the ways. Understand the explicit and implicit. With love, children, today's class will be meaningful for you literally. It is sure that from today's class, you will definitely get two to three marks in the question, which means it is sure that it will come. There will be no mistake in it. Your formula is there, the concept has been understood. The answer has been given direct value. This much education was given in 2022. Focus is on two marks.Focus on two marks, I will remove those rate also, now I have the same question, see 1.3 Something, what will be the power of -1, why do we take s-mins, if sin is 0, then the power of -1 is zero, what will become positive and if sin is ven, i.e. negative, then what will become negative number, it will become a negative number. We go on to understand the reason of each thing, power of you is A and you know what capital is equal to you small.If K becomes bigger then how much will it become A - A S Sir where will the value of this A come from? The value of this A will be given here from the power of 2Younger brothers and sisters, look carefully, if I want to write this explicitly, then what should I do? I will make the immediate beat after the point and how much should I shift? 1 2 3 I will shift right. If I shift right, then your power plus three A will become capital A. So what do you have to do? If you have to shift here and only two beats are to be done, then 1.0111. If you have understood my words, then tell me, look, I have also brought an example.Our saying is that Aarti for hand and bracelet, What difference does it make to the educated? The obvious does not need proof. It is obvious and the proof is there. If the place is clear in front of you, then start your work, then what do you learn? Sir, Exclusive also came. 0.1 means van comes after the point. Make explicit implicit meaning should be made before the point. Implicit should be made inside itself. How will you remember the implicit i.e. take it inside itself. Before the point.Take the van you're all clear baby 4.875 4
If I write .875 plus in 4.875, then you will write four like this, implicitly, I told you something, every child should represent it in explicit and implicit and format, how much he has to do, format, how much he has to do, one four and punch beat, what son, S is yours of one beat, this is yours of 4 beats and M is of mine of 5 minutes, just hurry up children, answer to this question questionI will also bring the answer. Thank you Shweta, son, bless you. Really, my children, my younger brothers and sisters, I will miss you a lot, but right now we will not be so emotional. Right now we have to fight a very long battle, we have to do a lot of topics and have read all of them. You have really enjoyed sir. I am teaching each and every thing from the fundamentals. Sometimes, how willThere is no capital i, what is not explicit and implicit, what is explicit and what is not, you are adopting the whole thing, give me the answer, I am all children, every child should do both, hurry up children, all children, every child should know the answer, son, every child should know the answer, see children, I am teaching you, give explicit, give implicit, okay, what did you do in explicit, 1011, tell quickly, tell quickly, 101 end111 Those whose answer has been 'A' can write in the form of acknowledgment in the chat box. Anything whose 'A' has actually been 'A' and have been understood from the heart. 'Love you my dear students H and everyone Prashant love you son love you look here understand my point now you do I don't worry Arpita what are you writing no for 4.875 first of all wrote 0.3 something should come na to apn kitni badi shift karenge teen beat to tu tuPower of ki plus ye kitna aa gaya 3 manti se aa jaayega my 100 111 how much aa gaya how much will it be 22 how much will it be power of 2 4 - 1 date is 8 so capital i kitna aa jaayga a + a s 3 plus how will you write 811 in 4 beats 101 Have you understood till now you have understood the point then look Implicit of sign positive number 1.3 Something 1.3Child, you should learn something, what does 1 need, brother 1, if you want, how much will your power come here, your power will come here, brother, your mental will come here, zero zero triple van, zero zero triple van, Arpita, what is the doubt, son, ask son, whatever it is, zero zero triple van and I, how much will it come 2 ^ 4 - 1 A to my 8: 2 to my eight, how will you write in plus eight, S, my 1 beat sign.Positive capital I, mine was 10, then 101, mine was 00. This is my mental A. Is it crystal clear to all the children till here, it is crystal clear, it is full, wait, now understand the second point, Sir, if I ask you two questions, either it will happen like this, how will it happen, how will it happen, what will happen, I am teaching the value formula for simplicity, the first one is teaching for implicit power S. Look carefully, children.See, it is a very interesting topic, the next big question will come, thank you thank you sir, how to remember and you remember this, you become a big A by doing small subjects one by one, gradually becoming excellent and becoming full excellent, it is funny but the way to remember is okay, look here, how much is capital I, how much is capital I, it is capital only, van zero, van zero means capital A.10 Bye, see my mentee, this is my mention, this is my mention, if the power of the van becomes zero positive, then what has I understood, I am seeing, Vinod is crystal clear, everyone is pistol clear, now listen sir, teach me explicitly too, you said, I will teach you, you said, I will teach you, son, capital is the game here, van zero van van van capital will remain 8 and 100 11 ok 100 [Music] VanVan, what did you do? If you shift 3 beats, then Van zero zero point Van Van zero zero My point, now I am going to say a big thing 10.1 How much did your answer come? Hey, its value is four, its point is five, its point is 25, your answer is 0.75 4.75, it means to say many times, not always, many times wrong result, not accurate result, don't know when that will happen, when yourIf I take the beat to be small, as you can see here, this was your value, answer question, what should come, what was your data, son, what was my data, 4.875 4.875, but when you solve it, how much did you get in the explicit form, 4.75, a little bit, a little beat, a little beat, loss occurs, it does not happen every time, disclaimer, taking sun causes loss.
This doesn't happen every time, it happens many times because son, you have a beat here, don't you see, here it is 1.0, so here you can commodet more sons, if it is a small format, you can commodet more sons, there is no problem for the big one, but if it is a small format, more is in front of your eyes, it is 4.75 A, here it is 4.875 A, it is clear, so sir, then which one do it, make it explicitly implicit to you.It will remain after looking at the question. If you have reached the full level till now then make your heart clear. Do not write crystal clear. You have reached above crystal clear. Write each and every thing. You have understood the value formula. You have understood the question. You have understood the answer. You have understood the question from within. You have understood the question answer. Sir, do this next. It has been told to you that it is explicit. Every child who writes this will not incur any sin.So if you don't write then see how to read the question. What are you saying? Your register is of 16 beats. It's a good thing. Thank you, thank you. I love you all my dear. Now listen, do you know that my 'S' is of one beat? The rest of the melon will be cut and will be divided into them. The axis is 32. What has happened to my bios, what will become of 22? First of all, it will become 22. One thing, so let's learn this. Let's capital learn this. If you want to give the value of the cake in nickel also then buyers 32.i.e. power of you - 1 2 power of 5 = power of 2 k minus van to five equal tu ke mines van to exponent mine how many beats will go exponent mine how many beats will go son exponent mine how many beats will go if 6 beats will go then melon will be cut oh melon will be cut han sir will definitely be cut so one more 6 becomes 7 out of 16 7 are gone so 90 saMy mention of 9 will come, mine will come of no beat, according to each and every thing you have given, sir, thank you, thank you, thank you, for the diamond crystal, thank you, thank you, you listen here, what you have to write, 29.19, see children, my younger brothers and sisters, see what you have to write, who ever wants to ask 29.75 mines, that too, see, one will go to 16, one eight, 24 and 1, 4, after 28, 29.That's right, this is from mines only, I will not tell in this format, you will please please thank you children, thank you, God bless you, Shweta Pandey, God bless you, I wish you all got a good rank, brother, hurry up, children, do question by question, answer by question, I have done what I said, if anyone still has doubt, welcome everyone, tell me, you give the answer to this, give the answer to this, all the children.Please thank you Prashant, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, 754 also have to be done, it has been understood, hurry up, just hurry up, what is being said is being said explicitly, you will do it, children, I am doing this to you so that there is confidence in you that you are making the new year with your happiness, so that even Han Bhai's fear is over, it is over, Sir, there is no more tension now, Sir, the milk of milk has become water of water, Sir, a little S Prashant, now look at this children.It is 29.75, I have written it on my own, now look what I am shifting here, how much is 52, how much is 32 capital, how much will be 37, write in 5/6 beats, 32, 4 and 1, then the answer will be yes or no, children, if full is gone, tell quickly, if full is gone, then tell quickly, write the value formula, minus van's power, S 0.n * 2.Power small 37 capital variety son, you can write in six, this is zero, A will come in I, then the number will come as per the system, I will come as per the number system, you have to write ₹37, write 37, if I had to write in 8 beats, then how would I write zero, zero 32 16 84, I would write 32 and 436 12345678, if I had to write A in 8 beats, then I would write like this, my son.I have understood that if you had to write 'A' in eight beats, 'A' would have been written like this, but Sir, I made you sit with me in this, Sir, how many beats were there in 7 beats, Sir, seven beats, so how dare you add zero in the last, you do not even have the slightest knowledge to add zero in the last, then the weight will not increase, no son, no, no, it does not mean, add zero in the last, here you are saying, add zero here, and here you are saying here.Add zero, that is your hypocrisy, this is your hypocrisy, here you are saying, add zero here, get it done, no, here you are saying, add zero here, what will you remember like this? No, son, don't remember, that is why I came to you, whatever number has to be written in whatever beat, write it with love. You write it with love, whatever number is there in whatever beat, we will write it, but maintees we have zero in the last.
It is mine sir, it will not make any difference, my value will not increase, let's see son, don't worry, what is the power of mines van, zero, how much is 111013, 32, exactly 0.101+ I will add zero, I will add 1801, I will add 160, I will add one thing each, water water milk milk, I have understood it, it is not even 11:00 and I have already understood it, thank you and father, just like that, I have seen.21.75 Am I impressed to explain 16 + 4 + 1 to imply 1.3 something, look carefully, look carefully, it becomes 1.7, how much is small i, four capital i, how much will a, 22 how much will a, son, 22 a will go, power of 2, 7 - 1, power of 2, 62, a will go, mine, 642, mine, a, will go, 64, no matter how much you give, Vijay sir, we will do it.I am gone, I am 42, I am 64, this is 68, so write in capital one 68, how much is 64 + 490010, we will do it here too, no sir, ok, I have understood till now, I have understood till now, I have understood, now look at this, learn to find out its value, learn to find out its value, power of mines van, power of S1 dot M * 2, I am capital, how much is my capital, just say.So 68 more buyers, how much is my power plus 1.1, how much will it become, 1 2 4 8 16 21.75 A Gaya, my younger brothers and sisters, one more thing for the crystal clear pistol, listen to this value, this value is repeated many times.It seems that there is nothing more than that, whatever you have done is the same, it is a good thing, make a combination of four, make a combination of four, make a combination of four, live a happy life, this combination of 4 is 12, how much is it, 12456 whose is 21.75 In the floating presentation, children have understood that A has gone and A has gone, so make the value of heart S, son, its value will remain zero because what is your sign beat?If it is positive then its value will be zero. Ravi Gupta The place is clear till now the place is clear, I have understood, look at everyone, if you don't want to do anything, then do your format, either zero point, something, how will you come out, okay in power, you will come out in power, and what is BIOS, how will you come out, people, power exponent of 2 with mines, no mines, so what happened S1, no, look here, no S van, there were mines, so ok, ok, understood.Understood, very good son, you are awake, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, small things keep happening in big countries, sometimes I also get emotional, it doesn't matter as far as I have understood, till now I have understood, I have understood, now listen what happens, there are some problems in this, there are different types of people who are representing themselves, there are some drawbacks in this, to overcome this drawback, I came up with Triplee754 precision format came 754 came no need to worry about it all the concepts you learned are the same but there is a change rest I am teaching brother you are fair Vijay Sir so see what is the disadvantage which was normal representation you cannot store zero because either you will write explicit or you will write explicit 1 point something something and the number which is not normalizedIf you can't even do that, then come to King Khan E-Seven Five-Four Floating Point Presentation for this, in which two formats are available, single piece, double ply, it is okay, there is extended too, but you have to read these two, it has a format of 32 beats, it has a format of 64 beats, what you read is the same, what you read is the same, what you read is the same, there is no need to worry at all, the value of A remains fixed, eight beats, you know S since childhood, it is fixed.Melon will be cut for a total of 32 beats. Melon will be cut for a total of 32 beats. One, this exponent will be eight and the rest will be the third, but there is one change in it, just one change is made so that it can do it for zero and infainight. After the power, there will be mines vane also at the bottom, that is, if the exponent is of eight beats, then 8 - 1 i.e. 27, just keep in mind, clear, clear, how much is the axis here, 1023.Sir, the power of 2 is 1124 - 1013, the difference is only 22, the rest of the game is the same, here the exponent is represented in 11 beats, here the remaining bit is 23 bits, here it is 52 bits, here mention is written in 52 bits, you can play with very big numbers, it is crystal clear till here, forget everything Modi's Modi, remember which movie was that Reddy, forget that one from the book.listen children what to say
Do you ever want to have single precision in floating point? Now let's question this directly. You do this question and you are told how much is the implicit exponent of 8 beats. How much will be the byers. My younger brothers and sisters, your power is 8 mines and your power is seven mines. Here it will be 127. What is the value of this A? 1248 16 32 64128 132 Sir, you have just put 4 zeros, how many 420 have you put, not even four, but two zeros, here you have played, Sir, you have played, you have played so many zeros, if you had put so many zeros then it would have been correct, you are also happy, I am also watching, who is behind, I have put till 23, children, you give the answer, you give the answer, every child give the answer, from the answer both question and question answer can be formed quickly.Hurry up, there is a little shortage of time, hurry up because I have to learn the concepts of secondary memory also. Hurry up children, and look, 11:00 is about to strike, I told you that every single thing will become crystal clear, okay, there are still 15 minutes left, after that I will teach secondary memory, so what is my formula, it is implicit, isn't it the power of Mines Van, this is the power of Mines Van, this is the power of Mines Van, I change it directly from C can to Mines Van, I am your power capital A.- A S Mines Van's power is zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero your power is capital. Look, children, what did you ever say if the power of Van Dot M2 is small? Your answer is A. Shift the punch beat. When you count them, your answer will be A. 56 children, A has gone full, A has gone full. Do this mission, you were of marks - 14.25, you have to do mines.14.25 has to be done - 14.25 has to be done and which one has to be done implicitly, which one has to be done implicitly, this is my 1 beat, how much is left of 8 beats, how much is left out of 32, so 23 beats and twenty-two are mine, how much will be left, 127 will remain, 22 will be mine, 127 will be left, you know everything, how will you write 14.25 14.258 four 1214 moreIn 25.5Do it quickly, children, do it quickly, do it quickly, becoming a Chol, Dada will not work. This Kishan has been asked of Marks only. Son, I have not brought this from my house. This is a question of GATE and there have been a lot of this type. There have been a lot of questions of this type. There have been a lot of questions of this type. Hurry up children. Hurry up. At first I had come today thinking that I will teach you about DMA or Second Memory, then I will make you do that, but out of them, Van Mark's has come many times like this.Question comes, you can do it even without studying, but out of this, it comes for two marks, I was expecting that you must have studied floating point in digital, but yesterday you accepted that sir, we do not know it, we will not be able to do it, it seems that I am saying it in this mention and mostly open, implicit is also taken, brother, by default, I am saying here right now, you have to take implicit, you are fine, accurate result is given in implicit, I will give you proof of this.Look, whatever I am saying, I have used implicit in most of the cases and explicit in most of the cases. I don't know the accurate result many times. Like you saw, out of 4.75, it was 4.75 out of 4.875. Whenever it is small, okay Shiva Hemant, I am saying that you have to do it implicitly, here and here I am saying that now you have to do it implicitly.There will be mention in the question, don't worry and implicit, it gives your accurate result. Very good son, there is a lot of topics, there are a lot of slides, otherwise you will say like this, Sir, you did not get this done, you did not get that done, I will get everything done son, I believe that today you must have become a fan of floating point, it was fun S, what will happen to me, how much is 127, then capital A will go, how will I write 13130 in 8 beats, 128 and two 128And two 128 [music] A went and the rest I wrote down mentally, find out their value, I am doing it from here, I have to make it, so see how much will its value be? Zero zero van's van zero van zero's six 010, the answer will be A, then your answer will be A, which one will go C 164 C 16, everyone is crystal clear. Next listen, there are conclusions till here, son, are there conclusions?If the sign is either positive or negative, whatever will be zero or van positive. Now there are some conclusions in this. If my A, if my I, if my I is zero, if my I is zero, then two things will happen. If my I is zero, then two things will happen. If MB 0 is found or M is not found. Zero is found. If MB is 0, if MB is 0 is found then what will it be called plus minus zero and if M is not found zero then that is your infection form.
I will represent myself, the second thing will be that if all become E1, if all become A1, if all become E1, that is, if it becomes 255, then two things will happen, either M will be zero or M will not be zero, if M will be zero, then infainite plus minus, if you look at the sign and if M is not zero, then it is not this number, it is not a number and respect wise, keep your game going, whatever you are reading, all those things are this single.It is for double precision. Same things are for double precision that if e2 is 047 if all is one is one example lone don't worry if all is one one then two things will happen either m will be zero or m will not be zero if m is zero then infainight if we are not zero then not this number is note number and then two things will happen either m is zero then m is not zero and if m is not zero then m is not zero.We will represent it in fractional form and we will play the rest. See the next question. What did I say? If your exponent is all zero and your zero is zero, then two things will happen: either the mentee will be my zero or it will not be zero. If I am the third also my zero, if I am the third also my money is zero. If I am the third also my zero is what will happen. The value will become zero. Either the plus can be zero or the minus can be zero and not adservisement.If it happened then we will represent it in fractional form and sir if a saare van hui if gestures became van hui saare van meaning I am writing for 64 sare van means old dynasty then two things will happen either M will be zero if M is zero then infainite M is not zero then take its example na take its example Aap ye lo ho tu represent 1.0 in 754 precision format and fast beat1.0 Okay, how much is zero buyers 127 then how much will capital A go to 127 If you have written capital equal here, if you have written this here then you will write 1.0, what value will come in a single procedure, three coming zero zero block, this was a question, see the question of the normal one, this one is 64 double persis, double pigeon, this is the data given, so what did I do first one beat, 11 beats more52 beats Look carefully, here my gestures are van, isn't it? Hey Han, then tell me that all my vans are closed, A is all my vans, that is, the value of A has happened 2017 11:04 minutes Now it has been said or not, whatever you fill, now likhiyega line, after this I am going to start my Another which secondary memory son, make it from here because make it from there, somehow the total is in the multiple of four in the power of four.Shweta Pandey, now write not in the chat box, son, take whatever thing I know, what I said, I have a little more Patna, I will take it in the Piyush series, this is my promise, brother, give me the approach of questions, don't take tension, learn, I will miss you, I also miss you my dear, but I will meet you, listen to us, it is possible in APA's series of DBMS and give new questions, give new questions series.Maha Revision Formula Revision C will meet definitely ok nine suniyega children, what is the first platter? There is a surface in the platter, there is an immense surface, there is an inner surface and there are tracks inside them, what are these kocentric, what are they saying, tracks and from track to track, its track number is zero, its center track number is zero, its center track number is zero, its track number is zero, cylinder number is zero in its form, there is no mill like that which comes to grind wheat.Chakki, just look here, its track number is zero zero zero zero zero zero zero cylinder number, zero cylinder number are vanes which are divided into sectors, variety son, sector variety, what is the complete structure of the disc in sector, went from Delhi to Poona, went from Poona to Patna, whatever it was, look here, where is the platter divided from the platter in the surface, the surface varieties are divided into tracks and the tracks are divided into it, what happens into sectors and sectors, son?Son, because of you I have learned to understand, you have taught me to read for 3-4 hours in the morning. I will thank you so much, that's why I don't go to the direct memory. Let's see what is happening. Sometimes the letter is divided in your surface, in the surface, in the track, in the sector and sector, what is there in the surface, son, what is the data in the surface, brother, there is a spindle, there is a mango which keeps facing, it is from my sector, son, and it is my track and there is a spindle, it is less on which it moves, it is rotation.If it does, then this is my platter. Now see what happens. Learn children, don't worry, still let me say something more important.
I am not saying that in a crash course we are not able to cover so much even in foundation, many times but I have tried and whenever it was possible, when you bring this PPT, you will believe that not only me, the whole team worked hard for you, the whole team and me especially in 15 days, what content to give for the next day and what questions to frame. Look at the complete script, keep one thing in mind, rank will come later in the paper, if it comes to mind first then any teacher would take the class later.Earlier, he would have known that today the class has to be conducted like this sir, teaching is one eight, son, teaching is eight, teaching is art, yes, thank you, put it in, thank you, which topic, how to go to Patna, when to go to Patna, all that script should be according to him, the question should not be one topic, its question should be in a scattered uniform manner, everything should be in a scattered uniform manner, so I was working for the same thing, the entire DP team, typing team, everything people.Stay engaged and for that, every faculty member of Team Rona, every employee of Drona team, anyone from Physics gate, whether it is DP operator or studio operator, is engaged for you and will support you till now, will support you till the gate and just asked one thing from you, on the first comment, on the first video, whatever is your experience, what is there in our modern system, what is divided into platters, what is platter, circular.The surface is like a CD, whose size is this, there is no problem, any platter has two surfaces which are covered with magnetic hands, and to what is it attached, there is a mango from the arm, Diksha Mango, it keeps moving here and there, better than this one here, from the evening, now listen, the surface is divided into tracks and the head tracks are divided into sectors and the van mango position, my dear, so dear.Cocentric means those who are from the circle, son, stop now, isn't it once but in the east track, the content is 100 of sector and a sector capacity, let's measure ourselves in bits, you look here, children, see this is what I told you, what did I tell you, brother, there are platters, there are surfaces in platters, there are tracks in the surface, there are sectors inside the track, and from track to track, track to track will form a cylinder, I told you this, look carefully, keep a pen copy, sense of time.But we will learn. See this question. There are 16 letters, there are two surfaces, there is a track of van in each surface, which I have divided into 512 sectors, and when the capacity of one sector is 2, then tell the capacity of the entire dicks. You tell the entire discus capacity. Children, do not leave the class now, the class will continue. You learn only please simply ask in D capacity, I would have done it with the solution.I am and not about coming, the question is, if you have ₹ 200 in one letter, then there are 16 letters, then how many 32 surfaces have a capacity of 512 sectors, my power of you is 35, you are power is divided into surfaces, Shiv and description will be there, to go to the particular sector, then what will you do, when the platter reached the surface, the track reached the sector, what will you not take, if you do not take the capacity of the sector, that is, if you will not take the data size, then see.Children reached the surface letter track sector on the platter, turn them into power, power of 2 came and 24 will take 24 beats, this question came in Gate 2007, hurry up, hurry up Shiva son, give the answer quickly please everyone do it fast my dear 16 sir on 128 track 256 sector 512 to the power of 420, this can also be one and particularTo reach sector 4 + 7 + 8 19 is clear, son, I am going to take floating point question in 2022's PA series Shyam, earlier I was taking it today but in my pypic series, the first question will remain the same of floating point, I will do the paper of 22, paper of 21, paper of 20, we will take revenge for everyone, its ok evening, don't worry in which series I will get it today.I was bringing it but did not bring it because of the bike, I will get it done. Now listen, as far as you have understood, what is surface and what is not, then you can spend time. How many cylinders will be there, how many number of tracks, how much will be the capacity of one track, how many sectors are there in the track, how much will be the H sector capacity, H sector capacity and the capacity of the cylinder, how much will be the surface and track capacity, if I take a disk
Now listen, here you have three types of time, here you have three types of time, one is teach time, one is rotational time, one is transport time, read a little more, you will be able to read a little more, people look, brother, I am running out of ideas but if you ask, I will read, tell me read a little more, it will be done, tell me the transfer time, I have read it, so now I have done it.Listen to me, now you listen to me, please first of all, if you have any doubt then tell me, if there are any other doubts, then I will teach you one thing, I will revise again and again, I will revise again, I have even less, now I also have a class, now and you first, listen to me on an i1, which I had promised you, look carefully, everything is good, keep the chat box, keep the chat box, keep the chat box, please listen carefully, listen carefully, listen to your CPU organization on an i1.Have you learned that, there was a pinch of vermilion, time please open, let's take it in the questions, I don't worry, look, don't think that sir has freed it, it has not been done, whatever topic I know, which topic I am not doing here, I will learn it first, whatever topic I am not doing here, I will take it in the questions, I will do it through questions in PA question series, chaliyega Tapan Prashant, because many children saidIt is said that I have to go to college, sir, many children have different regions, you know quickly, please say quickly, friend, whatever you say, are the college classes fast, please tell me and you please, what is half off rotation time, how is half off rotation time, how does it come out, how does it come out, take me, I say, it is reducing at 600 rpm, that is, 600 rotations in 60 seconds, so how much does it take in one rotation, how much Vanshi?I will understand till now, get it done, I am doing a little, son, don't be nervous, don't be stressed, don't be nervous just for you guys, suniyega, you can just break the mode, samjhaunga, I will learn a little bit, I will learn, okay, I will not let you down, promise me on sea time, rotational attention, don't go now, transfer time and transfer rate, these are the four terms, okay, will never go outside the track, will never go outside the track, will point to one track or the other, read right hunter, either forward or backward.It will move in one direction, it will move in the same direction either clockwise or anti-clockwise, this is fine sir, now you tell us what is Sikh time, first of all Sikh time is the time taken to reach any particular track, date is this time, rotational attensi is the time taken to reach any particular sector, date is called rotational latency, what is half of rotation time, on average half off.What is the rotation time? Sir, how do you accept it? If I say that mine is moving at 3600 rpm, if the rpm says then 3600 minutes per rotation, look carefully. Minutes per 3600 rotation i.e. 60 seconds, how much did it cost ₹ 3600, my younger brothers and sisters. 60/3600, this cancels van by sixty seconds of one, 60 seconds, then how much will be the rotational latency, half off.1 / 60 second i.e. 1 / 120 second date, this is my rotational luck, one is yours, what is the data transfer time?Learn that once you transfer data time and data transfer, a truck driver is fine, so listen, one truck driver fell asleep in one rotation, what is meant to say is to say, how much time did it take you to complete four KVs, 1/66 from the previous example, look carefully, how much time did it take you to complete four KVs, capacity of one track, four times, how much time did it take you, 4kb, 1/6 second, 1/6 seconds, son, how much will it take for one byte, 1/60 * 4 seconds, if I say, the required data is as much as x bytes, the amount of retired data, do not remember any formula, how much will it take,
Transfer time is one more, my younger brothers and sisters, one is mine, I teach through this, one is my data transfer rate, what did someone say, never said this, never said that one track in one rotation, one track in one rotation, that is, one rotation, means in 1/60 second, if you say one track, one track, then how much did it cost for four, even for 4, how much will you send in one second, 60 * 4 Kbps i.e. 240 Kbps.Yes very good 240 Kbps Thank you 240 Kbps Children, have you understood my point, have you understood then what is C time, this is your on average on average half of rotation time, let's take transfer time, D, amount of time taken, you transfer, D, require data and transfer rate, how much time is one unit of time, how much data are you sending, date is called ray.Every child should do this question. Every child should do this question. Please do it quickly. Once you have spoken, listen and learn. Every child should do this question. Please do it. There are 512 sectors and the capacity of each sector is 512, so you have to transfer the data of four sectors and the data transfer rate has been calculated. Children, people are having a lot of fun with this concept. It is a dark song but where is it supposed to light a lamp? I respect all the children.Hours, you have jailed me, still teach me till the end, son, now I will also revise once, I will see it completely, children, come on, do it, do it quickly, do it quickly, very good, according to you, I am very happy, look here, if you have overhead, you have some extra time, brother, how come, or the controller also takes so much time, tea, water, father, he takes breakfast at the midway, so now it takes so much time, so that too is fine, now look, I am asking a question, what is it asking, sometimes we learn while learning.Time is already given, 30 nano seconds rotational 360 rpm, so 360 rotations, watch carefully, children, please watch carefully in 60 seconds, so how much did it take in one rotation, my younger brothers and sisters, 65 360 1/6, so how much did the rotation take in one rotation, I write down, I will come down on the side, how much did it take in one rotation, 1/6 second, sir, it took so much son, so how much did it take in one rotation, half off.Rotation Time Van Rotation Time 1/12 sec Sir, I have understood now, now Sun, calculate the capacity of one track, what should you calculate first, how will you calculate the capacity of a truck, how will you calculate the number of sector * H, Sector Capacity, Number of Sector, how dear, 256 is also fine, every child suniyega children, every child, now what does it mean to call you van tractor year, how much time did it take you in 256 KV, 1/6 second in 256 KVAnd how much do you need, 4 sectors, 4 sectors, 2 K, how much do you need, 2 KV, sir, 2 KV, how much will it take for 2 KV, my brothers and sisters, 1/6 * 256 KV * time will be taken, sir, how did it go from B to B, 128 A, so it went to A, one upon 6 * 128 seconds, what is its value, I don't know, this is your data transfer time, OK, what is yours?Data transfer time is gone, now I will teach you one more thing son, transfer rate, learn from this ghabraiyega, don't worry at all, data transfer rate is the same thing, how much time is taken for one rotation in a track i.e. in a truck, how much time is taken by van by six in van by six, how much track did you cover in a second, how much is 256 KV for 256, how much will be transferred in one second even for 256 son, see in how many shortcuts, everything has been taught on one page, this will be1536 kbps was Happy Happy My Dear.Total size of van track so you read the required data, much time is required i.e. in one rotation the total will be of one truck, how much was being taken in one rotation, it was 1/6 and 1/6, it was 1/6, so what is the size of the total track, 56 KV, 4 sectors have to come out, that is, when 2 have to come out, then see, in the middle of 256, you felt 1/6 in 256 KV.If you put WAN by six then how much will it take in two 1 / 6 * 2 K also this WAN then this is your answer A Gaya Data Transfer Time What did you say I can transfer C in one rotation Given the WAN track WAN track size So how much data can be transferred in one second So see how much data can be transferred in 1/6 second Even at 256 K So how much in one second 1536 Kbps Brightness Everyone Small Fat Please This was a gate question, you guys do this and write it down nowSir, you accepted our request, thank you very much for this. Thank you. You listened to what I had promised in the first class to complete the plant.
1 on i1 on i1 on complete architecture Master ji Great Jhumka Look, this is a comment right, wait for the last one too, once we finish this subject, now thank you son, I will program my transformer mode, okay don't worry, I will do it with main numerical, don't panic at all, don't panic, in this I have explained the rough concepts and the addressing format of the program is DM, how will we represent the sector, track number, sector number.Plotter surface, I will do all this to you, last me for 10 minutes, take 10 more minutes, you bear me for 10 minutes, say me properly, do you bear it, or you bear it once, I give you 1 minute, from this i1, you record a little, you record a little, the whole computer architecture, you record a little, you recall, thank you Mohit, thank you, thank you, you recall the whole computer architecture, from an i-van, I give you 2 minutes, then I will make you recall, we will see as much as from the first class.Have you read till date? We will do all the recall from this Ivan only with this i1. Hurry up, children, you have not taught this till date. Hurry up, I will take 2 minutes from you, you record for two minutes, I will tell you, then you all should give up food and drink to study. Sir, till the time I feel that I have taken all the last ones from the previous years well, then I will do it. Okay, I am not feeling hungry, stop eating and drinking, keep the pen copy and listen to me carefully, only a few in the chat box.I don't have to write later, I will talk about you in the end, okay now you suniyega, my point is, I will get the entire computer architecture revised with this, do the start, give me a signal, give me a signal, do it once, sir, make a heart, then write anything, it could be in i1, it could be a nuclear bomb, it could be someone else, it could be some other code and address field, it could be what type of instruction is there, where is this nuclear bomb lying in my i1000Every child, listen carefully. Don't write with any pen in the copy. If someone is disturbing you at home, then give me a punch. Please forgive 5 minutes. Let them listen for 5 minutes more. Take the gel from the morning. 5 more minutes from morning. Okay, now suniyega, what do you want to say? First of all, this i1 came, first of all, understand this. I don't know what is there in a computer. What are the instructions and data in the program? What is the binary sequence? So this must have been one of my i-vans.Instruction number van I don't know there is a time bomb in it What is an atom bomb What is it and what is not so first of all I was going to instruction cycle to execute it On instruction cycle I first went to fetch Where did I go to fat Carefully sikhiyega In the match I gave the value of PC A went to IR of CPU A went to Er and the value of program counter would be incremented to I2 On the next page I must have gone to I2 Now I don't know There is an atom bomb in thisWhat is the instruction, what is there in the data, I don't know sir, I don't give, I will go for execute, first of all I must have decoded, after that my program must be running, execution, what must I have done first in analysis, what type of operation must I have done first, after that I must have seen the operands, after that I must have calculated the address of the operand, after that I must have fetched the operand, then suniyega my less from here.It starts that first of all I analyzed what is the code, what type of code is here, here is my data transfer, here is my data transfer, what is the meaning of data transfer sir, what is the meaning of data transfer sir, see your three four types of instructions are broad, data is transferred or data manipulation or program control program control program control light transfer of control, this is also two types of unconditional or conditioner like unconditional jump not zero. Understand what I want to say sometime.All letters are imaginary. What are the arithmetic logical shifts and rows in data manipulation? There are varieties in data transfer as well. In data transfer too, you will either get loaded or stored. How are these two? If you are specifying my memory, then load and write in the store room at home, then either there is memory or not. In and out are in and out. When you have to read something from the input device, these mean and if you have to write something, then youThis is how you give out signal
The stock specification register, the memory register, whether it comes in the data transfer category, whether it comes in the data manipulation category or the same type of instruction, after that came the availability of the operant. If we say sir availability, then sir availability should we say, is this my stag baseculator or accumulator base organization or general register organization? After this came its instruction format. After this came its instruction format.In the instruction format, is it fixed length instruction or is it variable length structure and if it is fixed length, if it is fixed length, then do you need expand upon technique? Do you need expand upon technique? Do you need expand upon technique? Will every child keep a PAN copy suniyega? My point is, first of all, looked at your instruction format, what type of instruction format it has, checked whether it requires expand upon technique, if yes, then we will do it, otherwise we will not do it.Sir, where is the operant being found? I have also asked you about the operant. I have also asked you about the addressing mode. On whom has I gone? On the addressing mode, yes or no? On the addressing mode, should it be direct? Is it indirect? Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Which ones are they of which type? After that, I have got the supreme knowledge, I have got the knowledge, I have got a lot of knowledge, is this all my stuff? Now I will talk about how to execute it. Then.I go to this, brother on micro operations, how would it be reducing, what would be happening, learned all those things, then I learned the micro program and then said this, where will it be executed, where will it be executed, it will be executed with the help of control signal, so for that we learned control unit, control unit is of two types, one is hard wire and the other is micro program, learn it carefully, watch carefully, accident valley control unit, these cycles are also visible in the control unit.If it keeps running then what is a cycle? Sir, then you told me the concept of a cycle. What is a cycle? In the concept of a cycle, you told that it is the clock frequency, the clock generator is the WAN gigahertz, which we are late in buying the laptop, what does the difference of 2.8 3.2 mean, does this then calculate my cycle time? What do I do with the cycle time? I calculate the execution time of the program, from it I can then calculate the map rate of the computer.Question key can also be derived, after this then I go to pipe lining. Sir, now I am going to the implementation, so I will divide them into sections, throw the code, execute the result store, keep executing it in such an overlapping manner and then I will find out its execution time in pipe planning. How much will be spent in pipe lining? K + N - 1 * TP Sir, where is the value of TP?Loan from your uncle's house, not TP, what is max off stage, non uniform delay and repeat, uniform perfect balance and TP of H off stage delay, if buffer delay is taken, then buffer delay will also be counted and what happens in non pipe lining? Ann Sir, we have learned this, speed off factor, non pipe planning upon five planning and when big number of tasks are done, then this is fine sir, but sir, how can I do it in this?If this happens, then how will they deal with the fetch and move memory, for this, first learn the concept of memory, what is the address line, data line and also learn your control line in the control unit, then now learn your address and data line, address line and data line of the head, if it is before the white address or before the world address, learn that then we came to the cache, first of all we saw where the CPU generated request will go, what will go into it, if the data is in how I, if the data is in how, date it, how to proceed further.Hit 'Apan Data Apna Data Man' from memory, how can I say sorry, how will I give it to the CPU in the Hindi form of the word and if it is not there, Apna Idhar Hoga, Sir Idhar Hoga Hoga, Apna Ko Puri Kaise Lehni How to learn, first of all, what did you do to organize both the memories, how to organize memory and memory at any of you, like you, here in your paging, here in your paging, what did you do in your paging, Logical Memory and Physical?The memory was also organized according to page size, here both my memories were blocked.
Sir, we will organize it here according to the size. Once we have organized it, then what will you do? How will you get the data from the main memory? For that, do your mapping technique for it. Sir, you had taught me three types of questions. We have also done the direct set associate. Now keep it carefully in the chat box. Whatever comment you have to write for yourself is not crystal clear in the last one. Is there anything to write? After that sir, I assume that the size of the cache is less, so what will I have to do?One of them will have to be replaced. If one does not feel bad then what will I do? Replacement Algorithm Replacement Algorithm I will do it that I will destroy it and Sir, before removing it, if I assume that the CPU has done all the work in less cache, who has seen the peacock king in the jungle, Sir, then what will I have to do, I will have to store the updated data in the main memory, for that, Sir, we have done the updating technique in it, there are two types of it, one is write through and one is write back in it.If it gets updated on time, then we will play and update it and then replace it. After this, you have also taught me how to do multi level. What is the meaning of multi level? Sir, in this you have taught in a different way, local and global, you have taught me in three terms, time is penalty, if you have talked in this way, then we have learned all the knowledge, sir, about this i1 too, you have learned the entire computer architecture of this i1, sir, now two-three more things are added to it, sir, one of you isThen tell me, sir, we went to the number system part, we went to the number system art, then we learned plotting point representation on this, how to write, how not to write, its complete format is done today itself, so don't ask again SIM, in this, first of all, we normalized the exponent, why did we make the exponent normal, why do we enjoy it? Oh no sir, when A is my negative, then I have to write my negative later. Comment and one line is needed in the form of comment.That is, I made up my mind, later listen to me first, now what did you do sir, in this I normalized your exponent because your exponent is negative, so I am taking two's complement, so how will I know, I will take its value and normalize it, then I will normalize my first exponent, then mentally put it on the implicit and express side, I will try on the implicit but it will be given in the question, don't worry about it.No default, it is okay not to conclude anything like this, but I told you that accuracy is more in implicit, proof is given, don't panic at all, it is okay after that, brother, how will it be stored in secondary storage, then I told you about secondary memory, brother, there is letter, there is surface, there is track, there is sector, there are dicks, now for them also time is required, seek time, rotational time is data transfer time, and there is a data transfer rate.Sir, then how will the data come from the input output, if I need the data, then there is a transfer mode for them, there is a program driven, an interrupt driven, a DM, all this sir, this is the complete OA, which is mine, which is mine, which is my son, my brother, it runs on my i1, it runs on my i1, sir, this is how the complete post mortem will be done on the i van and the output will be my result will be produced, so my dear student, now write other doubts and thank you, thank you my.Dear thank you, now you tell me if you have any doubt and now tell me your thoughts about CUA. Every child now do not cheat, it will be a sin, otherwise it will be a sin. If you cheat in it, it will be a sin. Keep in mind that this is the age transfer mode. They will do it with their numerical. Don't worry, I had come with this. Now write only by making heart, not by writing for a site. Now I have written and I am on the site. Get classes online and offline. You are the best teacher Saptak Das. Thank you.Thank you son, thank you to the children, I didn't even know how my journey was and I tried both DBMS and Co. I have finished the course so that I can teach it in the easiest approach. I have finished that too or I can finish it. I have tried my best for you guys. Now you can write your thoughts, okay it will be completed. How to do revision, do the revision in the same manner. Make short notes. Now you must have made notes. The more Piyush you put in, the more is the benefit.Now try and practice new questions. Now don't think of reading anything new. You provide the questions. The more you try, the more you will learn. Sir, my interest has gone, thank you so much.
Much provide golden thank you I also want to be like you thank you Ravi Gupta God bless you you have completed syllabus most important questions God bless you with your energy thank you in D concept and don't know Hindi waiting for you in English version yes I will teach completely in English don't worry thank you so much again welcome God bless youYou keep working hard like this, I am for you guys, not me, all the faculty members of Computer Science are going to have full fun from the 2nd date. Piyush is coming with a series for you guys, after that he is new and the legend will be with you, thank you, after that, a series of new questions, after that, Maha Revision Formula Revision, you are doing absolutely carefree, just keep working hard, you are going to have full fun and have come to the corner of the country to study, Team Drona and there is no money here, children.Love goes on and this is love Thank you love you all my dear friend God bless you yes in bravery I will teach you son I will teach you love you Manju love you my very own and everyone love you son Arpita God bless son to all Shweta God bless all the children whose name I know or don't know God bless all those who are giving me records whatever it is you work hard and get rank just ok so thank you thank you thank you
