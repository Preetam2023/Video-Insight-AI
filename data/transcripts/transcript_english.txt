Hello children, hello, how are you all? Yes, you are welcome. The second chapter in Inoff of Hope, Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure is an important chapter, but the special thing about this chapter is that a fixed type of questions are asked from it. There are some segments from where a question is always asked. Shape Geometry is always asked. There is always a question from MOT, that means this subject, this chapter speaks for itself.From where the question will come, we will complete this chapter keeping that in mind. Everyone has joined us. Please refresh us once. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Why are there two classes? Now all that is fine. Son, see mine later. And so what should I do? When you get time, it is okay to see what to do. If you have to cover it in one shot, then things will be like this. Manage them son. Problems are there as long as you accept them.Find a solution, the solution is that it is your wish, you can manage it as per your wish and see it as per your schedule, it is not necessary that you just sit here, sit with me the whole day, I am a straight talking man, it is your wish, whatever you want to manage, do it, it is okay, we too have pressure brother to finish the course, right, and you know it, we do not leave in the middle, we have said it, I have said it, be it any series of PW till today, be it any series of PW till today, be it ever till todayThere is no pause in the middle, not even a single child would be watching there, not even a single child would be watching it live. You understand my point, we do not start and finish it, we take it till the end, it is not like we left it in the middle, how much will you give, what is there, what is not there, don't worry, don't worry, sit comfortably, after today's session, the most important thing is to know what the questions should be and all the useless things. After this session, if you are having questions, then this session isIt is of use to you son, if it is not happening then it is of no use, is it? Or have you not looked carefully at both the things? Why do you stress so much about who is studying what, who is studying what, when and in which, if you have a simple question, then do it, it is a very simple thing, let's start, not many people will join me, I think children don't get up to get up, refresh once more, let's wait a little more, one minute will be enough, okay, it will do, no problem, let's go.Son, first of all we will do the complete chapter and there are topic wise questions and I have brought the important topics first and I will read them first. First of all, we will talk about the basic basics, what is a bond, what is a chemical bond, it is a simple thing, there is force of attraction between chemical species, son, and one very big thing which I will tell just along with this, first of all, write the force of attraction, such a thick pen, present.Between chemical species, now the question will come that why is there force of attraction in chemical species? Now what are the atoms that can come in chemical species? There can be atoms, there can be ions, there can be molecules. The force of attraction that will be felt between them is the same chemical bond. What is that, son? What is your chemical bond? The bond formation is coming due to attraction. Definitely a word comes out from here.If you write the energy released in bond formation or during bond formation, then you will be asked to tell what is the bond formation, how is it, what is the bond formation, how is it, what is the asothermic process, what is the process of bond formation, if it is assortative, then vice versa, if it breaks the bond, vice versa, if it breaks the bond, thenWhat will you say, it is done but if I write what will be the bond dissociation, if you are asked what will be the bond dissociation, to break the bond, there is a bond between A and B, you want to break it, breaking means you want to work against the attraction, whenever there is attraction in the world, energy will be released and whenever you have to work against attraction, energy will increase, then there is a bond here.Dissociation means increase of energy. This is an energy absorbing process. This is an energy absorbing process and energy absorbing process means how it will always be endorsed. Son, so you need to understand a basic thing which is
From the slide you can ask, tell me what is bond formation? So bond formation happens exiguously. Okay brother, let's go, so endo ajo, these are the basic things, you have understood them. Then let's come to the question that why two atoms that are together come together? What is it that two atoms that are together come together? So it was experimentally observed that when atoms come close, then the experimental value suggests that there is a bond between them.Overall attraction is more than repulsion. For example, let me explain to you that here there is a new atom, there is a nucleus, here there is another atom, let's make it with a different color, here there is another atom and it also has this nucleus, now what kind of repulsion will be taking place in it, suppose this is atom a and what is this atom son b, this is atom a and atom b, so the first thing is that the nuclei in it are each other.Look, there will definitely be attraction but there will also be repulsion, but the experimental value suggests that whatever we make will have more attraction. NCRT writes that the experimental value suggests that when two atoms come closer, the force of attraction between them is more than the overall repulsion. That's it, brother, now let's agree here.It has one electron on it and it also has one electron on it, there are more to be had, we just want to understand one by one, who will pull its electron, will it pull its electron, will it pull the nucleus, okay, so there is an attraction here and who will pull its electron, this electron will be pulled by the nucleus, second, will these electrons give repulsion to each other, secondly, will these electrons give repulsion to each other, overall here it is an experimental suggestion, isn't it experimental?Values suggest that the overall force of attraction is greater than repulsion. It is found in the form of a molecule. We do not find a single atom, so why is it so? It means that the atom is not able to exist alone. What is the reason because the overall attraction is more. It is clear from the experimental values that the attraction will be more. It is that it will form bonds with each other.What is the tendency of an atom, son, it will create a bond, son, come on, sir, are you not feeling well? Are you from Arjuna? Hello, we are fine brother, I am fine, if I teach on only one energy, I will be able to teach for a long time, if I shouted here in the beginning, then the work will be done, no problem, you see, come, come, now this is a basic thing, what do they get by making a bundle or not, what do they get by making a bundle, so we will see from two things, what is the bundle, before that I will pay your attention.I would like to take it back once in this whole chapter which the child says, teach from the basic, increase it from the basic, increase it from the basic, I am saying to him son, there is nothing basic about that, now what I am going to write on this board, what I am going to write on this slide is the most basic thing, once the reflection of this TV is coming in your view, I will correct it, it may have reduced a little, yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes, let's see how much will be the duration, will it run smoothly, then your six.We will finish it in hours but if it takes time in between, then it is a different matter. Let us try to do many useful things. Basic should also be covered. All the questions should be covered and the area will remain covered. It means things will be taught in such a way that the kind of questions are framed, then the unnecessary things will be removed from the meaningless things. Things will be taught by focusing on the particular topic as per the kind of question framed. Don't worry at all. Come Valance.What is an electron? It is a very big thing. This valence electron is important to know before that. What is important to know before that is the valence shell. What is important to know before that is the valence shell. Valence shell is the one which participates in bonding. Valence shell is the one which participates in bonding.It is written here, s2 2s 2 2p 6 3 a2 and 3p 3, now this is your eighth shell, this is your eighth shell, it will be called valence shell, what will it be called son, valence shell and the electron in it will be called valence electron and
How many electrons are there in it 2 P 3 Total five valence electrons will be there How many valence electrons will there be in it Son Total five valence electrons This is a basic thing and everyone should know that yes, what is called valence electron and in general the valence shell is the valence shell electron, it remains the same in the group, so valence electron means electron present in valence shell or I should say that the electron which is in bonding.Those who participate are your valence electrons, this is the matter of valence shell, what is it called son, what is called valence shell, what is it called, bring valence electrons, give me, this is what I was waiting for, it is strong, it is strong and it is sweet, it is very sweet, it is so sweet that my lips will stick, I will say how the children will be harmed, valence shell which participates in bonding is generally the outer most shell, generally it is written becauseWhat happens inside the d block is that along with 3d, along with 4s, that is, along with the four number shells, the electrons of 3d also participate, so we have written its more accurate definition that the shell which participates in bonding, if you leave the d block, then leave the rest of the d and f blocks, then in all the rest, it is the outer most shell. Mainly, we also study how many compounds.Mainly compounds are read only of s and p block, so it means that mostly we have this valence shell, which is the outermost shell only. Okay son, and the valence electron is the valence electron, it remains the same, generally, generally remains the same for the elements, belonging to the same group, especially the s and p block, especially the s and p block, like suppose this is Lithium, then what will be its valence shell electron?Son, this is 2s 1, like here, if sodium comes here, it will become 3s 1. Look, now if potassium comes here, it will become 3s 1. Let's suppose, if I write Boron, if I write what, son, if I write Boron, then it will become 2s 2 2p 1. If I write aluminium, then 3s 2 3p will become one, that is, it also has three electrons. It also has three electrons. It has one electron, so it also has one.An electron is an electron and what is there in it son, basically it is very important to understand the concept of valence shell. The concept of valence shell is the outer most shell. Imran Siddiqui is saying sir, it is not fun, you will stop for one and a half month, you will come son, the day you will understand this, sit peacefully, don't feel bad about serious teaching on this platform, but then it is a different thing, then have fun, there are many channels for fun, go, go straight to the point.I have not come here for fun, if I have come for fun, then there are other channels. Yes, my friend, I am not having fun, I am coming for fun, or to have fun, you don't even have to match the subject stream. I have seen that children who go for fun, they write below, madam, I am from commerce, still I read your bio, isn't that the real fun, so this is not there in life, son, that is not fun here, come on.So we write some valence cell electrons like suppose I wrote Lithium, after that I wrote Beryllium, wrote Boron, wrote Carbon, wrote Nitrogen, wrote Oxygen, wrote Chlorine and wrote Neon, write some valence electrons like this and in the morning son, sleep is not fun and a little bit lazy too, now its valence electrons, the first thing is its outer most shell is 2s 1, its 2s is 2, its 2 is 2 a2 2p 1, its is 2 a2 2.P2 is its 2 a2 2p is 3 its 2 a2 2p is 4 outer most I am writing its 22 2p is 5 and its 2 a2 2p is 6 I am asking you I have written this eth shell eth shell now I am writing le electron tell me how many should I write how many of these should I write I will not ask again and again one how many of these should I write two its three its four its five its six its seven and its will become eight.What are the valence electrons? Will they remain the same in the group? They said, how will they remain the same? Sodium comes below Lithium, Magnesium comes below Beryllium, Aluminum comes below Boron, Silicon comes below Carbon 3, Phosphorus comes below Nitrogen, Phosphorus comes below Nitrogen, Sulfur comes below Oxygen, Chlorine comes below 6, along with that, whatever comes below this also comes 8, so it means that when a bean stays in a group,
If it is the same then the valence electrons will remain the same, then the valence electrons are the most important link. This is a very basic thing of this chapter, that is why I am saying that if you remember it already, then it is fine, otherwise don't do this chapter. If you can remember this small thing, then come ahead with me, otherwise leave your hand from here. Please ok, let's go because I will ask, tell me how many valence electrons of sulfur, you will raise your mouth like this, no, the number of electrons of sulfur is as many asI will ask about oxygen, tell me how many valence electrons are there in phosphorus, you are saying three, I will say get out of here because why five, because nitrogen also has five, then I will keep asking you one by one about valence electrons, mostly we have only second period and third period which will be useful to us, at 90, more than that, at 90, we will ask only the valence electrons of third period and second period, I mean, either ask this series.I will take it or ask the series below it i.e. below it comes Sodium, below it Aluminum below it, below it Aluminum below it, below it Silicon, below it Phosphorus, below it Sulphur, then Chlorine, then below Neon, Argon, I will not bother you much, although if I ask below that too, it should come, but yes, most of the compounds we see are those that have a central atom, they are mostly found in the second period and third period, whatever compound we find in it.Mostly there are elements of second and third period only. Let's go ahead son. Yes, now it comes to the question of what these atoms need, so there was an old concept son, this is what we call it. We call it classical approach. This is what classical approach is and this is your modern approach. Classical approach said that every atom has to put its eight electrons in the valence shell. Now don't ask what is this valence shell because it has already been cleared.How many electrons does the atom have to have in its valence shell, son, eight electrons, this is its target, he asked him, brother, you atom, come here, O atom, come here, why are you doing all this combination, what is the problem, then he said, the attraction between us, oh, that is the reason for coming to you, but there must be a reason and a goal as well, isn't it? What is the reason that you are doing all this? So one of the atoms, who was an old-time atom, said, brother, valence.There are eight electrons in the valence shell. He said, why is there a problem with the valence electrons? Why do you want to have eight electrons in the valence shell? They say, do you know the inert gas? He said, yes, it is an inert gas. It has eight electrons in its valence shell. You said, yes, it is correct. There are eight electrons in the valence shell of an inert gas. So, the inert gas does not form any bond. So you asked, well, what will happen from this that it means that it is beyond illusion, it is stable, eight electrons will be in the valence shell, then what does it mean?Like inert gas, inert gas will become stable. There is no bond, brother, who makes fuss in life? Only the one who has nothing makes fuss. The one who has something to eat while sitting will not make any fuss. Inert gas is a royal type saying no problem. Beyond the illusion, he said, eight electrons are in the valence cell. There is no problem at all. Now we will not do anything. So till that time what was there was that the valence electrons were eight of inert gas and there is no compound of inert gas.So all of them made this the goal of their life. They said, Is this the Guru? I will also study. I will also study. I will also study. I will also study. He asked everyone, "What do you want in life?" Eight electrons in valence cell, "Why are you doing brother? We have to become like an inert gas. We too have to become like an inert gas. We also have to open a channel as soon as we enter the first year and then tell how to study. Everyone's target has become the same, why because everyone is like this?"He started considering the diamond hero as the hero, these octets must be something, tell me the stability in respect of energy, he was saying, I don't know what he was saying son, he doesn't know, then next came a modern concept which I will explain now and after that back to octets of minimum potential energy, now this thing which is the latest, the latest is that there are octets but there is a confine based concept that there should be eight electrons in the valence shell but there are many such.Look at the compounds which were stable and had less than eight electrons in their valence shell and more than eight electrons, which means octets have come, oh man, that is not the target, it is everyone's target.
If we bring good stability and to bring stability we will reduce the energy. What will the atoms do? What will we reduce our energy? It's simple. Take out all the energy from you. The energy inside you is potential energy. The energy inside me is potential energy. If all my energy is taken out, I will just sit here on the ground. Only the state sitting at one place on this ground will be said that I am stable at one place, I am not able to jump here and there.I am not able to walk there, I am not able to teach you, my hands and legs are not moving, so I have become stable, now it is okay, don't think of it that way, oh sir, your loss has become stable, I am not talking in that contact, I am talking, even the atoms will stop moving here and there and will stop pouting here and there. What will they become when they will come to their minimum potential energy, their energy will be at the lowest point.Sir, how can we bring this? Hey, we can bring this by forming a bond, we have taught it a little while ago, the very first slide itself was that when a bond is formed, there will be an attraction, if there is an attraction, then energy will be released, that is, every atom is reducing its energy by forming a bond and every bond. If every atom is reducing its energy by forming a bond, then it means that it is reducing its potential energy and the potential energy.It means that it is gaining stability, so from here we directly understand this thing, what does this modern concept say? Modern concept says that how, for example, suppose initially these are two atoms, now we have seen that when two atoms come closer, then beyond that, there is more repulsion than attraction. Sorry, attraction is more than repulsion, so they will start coming closer. When they start coming closer, then they will reduce their potential energy.Why will we do it? Because one person is here, one person is this, both people are running towards each other, this is Kajol, this is Shahrukh Khan and the DDLJ scene is going on, she is running from that side in the mustard field, he is running from this side in the mustard field, both are coming closer, coming closer, coming closer, coming closer, and then coming closer, they are chanting like this, why are they doing like this, why because they are tired, because they are tired, that is, what have you done to your energy son, have you reduced it?What have you done to your energy? Why did you reduce it? Because it is a system. Shahrukh Khan and Kajol have a system. Similarly, these two atoms also have a system. Thermodynamics teaches us that when a system works, energy is released. What does thermodynamics teach us that when a system works? What is energy released? Son, this is a whole system. It is working. Why because it is approaching each other. These brothers are coming here.Brother, coming here, both are working and when the system works then what is the energy? Son, this is releasing its potential energy and this is also releasing its potential energy. In this way, look at this red line, you have come here and is coming down, that is, whenever it is below zero, there will be an attraction and whenever it is above the line, there will be a repulsion. Look at this. You are coming here sir, there is a problem in MO, just see it completely orNow tell me, is this a question worth asking? Hey brother, the one who has the problem, then see why do you feel that it is necessary to see what you know, otherwise sir will feel bad. No, son, it is not like that, I want children, I don't want blind devotees, okay, I am a devotee, what do they say, I want children, I always say, I don't want devotees or are sitting forcibly, because it is my class, brother, I don't want such followers who will harm themselves in the name of my devotion, nothing else.Read the MOT when it starts, son, then come, there is a lot of talk, what does it mean, there is nothing in all this, nothing, come brother, so here it is, now let's say a stage has come, a stage has come where these two have done what, son, these two have stopped coming closer, stopped coming closer, meaning that Kajol and Shahrukh Khan have been running for a long time, have been running, have been running, have been running, as soon as they came here, they stopped, as soon as they came here, they stopped, now they have not come closer than this.Can they call it 'bond has become'? What do you call it son 'bond has become' i.e. it has become the minimum state here.
The point that you are seeing has reached a state with minimum potential energy somewhere and this is the bond formation point. What happened here son? Bond formation has happened. Now think about how much bond energy will be. Let's assume if there was energy here. Let's assume if here is a minus. Suppose you hadThe bond energy is there, then look at their traveling till here. Let's suppose that their traveling started from zero, although it does not start from zero, it starts from minus only. This line remains a little below, it is going to be a minus. Suppose it started from - 50 to minus 50 and by the time it has come to -350, this is the gap from -50 to -350, this is the gap from here to here.Whatever energy has been released in it will be equal to that i.e. the amount of energy released in the formation of the bond, that is the difference from the initial stage to the final stage, that is what will be called bond energy. Brother, the amount of energy spent in coming from here to here will be called bond energy, so it is called bond energy. What will happen from here to here son, it will be bond energy. Secondly, you will not see that it is written below here that it is inter nuclear.Distance: What is inter nuclear distance? Obviously, when two atoms are coming close, when two atoms are coming close, when two atoms are coming close, then their distance from their nucleus is checked and it is called D. It is called d. So when two atoms are coming close, then D is decreasing. So D is what we call internuclear distance. D is what we call internuclear distance and it isLater on, we will call it bond length, so when they approach each other, will D decrease basically, will D decrease? D is checked. The distance between the two nuclei of the two atoms that are coming, from the nucleus of both of them and from the nucleus of the other atom, is called internuclear distance and this is what is formed going forward, son, if the bond length is formed, then look at the inter nuclear distance, if you are coming here, it is more, when you are coming here.The internuclear distance is more, now they are moving from more internuclear distance to less internuclear distance, that is, they are reducing their distance, they are obviously making bonds. After coming here, they have got a fixed distance, now this brother has become like this, say A and B, now they have become like this, now more than this, they do not want to come closer on their own, after coming here, they have made a fixed D, they have made an internuclear distance, now they are not coming closer on their own, that is, as much asHe had to run, he had to run, he came and sat down, now he cannot come closer than this, we called this point as the bond formation point and here we clapped that brother, the bond has been formed, but now the issue is that then what will be the bond length, then obviously from this distance here till here, what will we call it, we will call it bond length, it is written above, look, whatever distance will be from here till here, what will be the bond.Why would there be a length because we have considered it to be a zero distance, exactly so much that one atom completely overlaps the other atom, such that it becomes completely superimposed, this is zero, that is not possible, but what will we call this distance, we will call it Bund length. Now you will have a question coming in your mind that sir, why has this graph started increasing again, what are you wanting? The bond has been formed, what do you want now, this graph is back again.Why has it started increasing? Where is this potential energy going? Why is it increasing? So now listen to it in two steps. The first step is that the bond has been formed. In the second step we will learn the process of breaking the bond and the same is taught in this graph too. Suppose now they do not want to come close as per their own will. Son, they do not want to come closer as per their own will. But you went and you caught the head of one, caught the head of the other and are not coming close. A simple one is a spring, okay there is a spring if you take it as per the need.If you press too hard then she will throw both of your hands away from you. It is as simple as that but you give the spring. These are two people, they have come as close as they want. Now if you want to bring them closer, they will not come of their own free will. So, what should I do? They said, force you.
You will not have to, that is, if you hold Shahrukh Khan and Kajol and make them sit like this, then Shahrukh Khan and Kajol are working or you are working on both of them. Said sir, we are working on both of us. Thermodynamics teaches that when you do work on the system, the energy of the system will increase. What does thermodynamics teach? When the system does work, energy is released. The system has done the work till then, now you are doing on the system, now what are you doing on the system.And when you do work on the system, the energy will start increasing again because thermodynamics says that the system does work, energy is released, if you do work on the system, the energy of the system increases, now you are doing work on the system, now this energy will start increasing and from here the breaking of its bonds starts. Why because when a condition will come here, a condition will come where attraction and repulsion will become equal, that is, no.So will they come closer or will they go far away, they will just stay together, that is what we call bonded state, bond formation has happened but as soon as you go here, this thing of repulsion will come here, the repulsion will be more than the attraction, why because you have brought them closer than required and when you bring them closer than required, then the attraction force will reduce and the repulsion will be more. It is clear brother Sir, please tell me the method to revise the energy nick like the rest.The same happens with the subject, son, it is not a big deal, right, revise the notes, the biggest of these organic things is revised notes, revise the notes and do questions, this is the revision, this is what happens in every subject, revise the notes, so have I explained the meaning of this graph, have you understood it completely, can you move ahead sir, teach a little faster, yes, we will do it fast, just feel the things, now I am telling you something that will help you.It will seem, hey friend, what am I saying, any big or small theory in the world will follow my point and that thing is that when a bond is formed, when an electron comes between two nuclei, when an electron gets trapped between two nuclei, it is called a bond, I told you such a small thing on the third slide, so sorry, I told you such a big thing on the third slide only, beyond which the entire wave nature runs, AOT also says the same, molecular orbital theory also says the same.When electrons get trapped between two nuclei, a bundle will be formed. It's simple, there is a cow here and another cow here. Hey guys, the cows are not cows, neither are you the real cow. There is one cow here and one cow here. If you don't put fodder in between, then why will these cows stay close to each other? They will fight with each other by honking their horns. So what is the fodder, whether you put grass in the middle or grass, only after that it will move here and this one here.Will move, that is, if you increase the material in the middle, if you start adding grass, then this D will come here, this Ghay will come here and in the same we wrote that Di, which is the internuclear distance, will decrease, that is, they will come closer, that is, when the electron gets trapped between two nuclei, it is called a bond. Son, what is the electron that comes between two nuclei, what is it called a bond? Now, the greater the electron density between the two nuclei, the larger the nucleus.The closer they will be, the more fodder there is, the more grass there will be, the closer they will come, that is, if you increase the reason for coming closer, they will come closer. One electron will be added, two electrons will be added, three electrons will be added, four electrons will be added, five electrons will be added, six electrons will be added, it means that they will come closer. Let's say carbon is single bond carbon, how many electrons have been added in the middle, said carbon is double bond carbon, how many electrons have been added in the middle, said carbon has four electrons.How many electrons have been put in the middle of triple bond carbon one? They said, six electrons have been put in between, which carbon carbon will be closest, I have not taught you anything till now, but I will still ask you to answer this question, I have not taught you anything, this is my magic, I have not taught you anything, my brother, I have not taught you anything, I just said that the more electrons there are between two nuclei, the closer the nuclei will be, this is the bond, this is what is called bond.
Every definition of the world, every theory will fit into it, I told you one thing, you will feel very mature that oh man, I don't know what you have learned, tell me which carbon will be closest to carbon because its nucleus and its nucleus will be closest because it has more electrons in the triple bond, because what is it in the triple bond, son, it has more electrons, it is just a simple thing, that is, keep it in your mind, different theories will come but remember this which is the eternal truth.The ultimate thing is that only the coming of electron between two nuclei can bring both the nuclei closer and when both the nuclei come closer then only the internuclear distance will decrease and when the internuclear distance decreases then the world calls it attraction that two nuclei are coming closer, that means atoms are coming closer and the bond is being formed, it is clear, we can move ahead brother, it is necessary to read NCRT after the lecture, it is not necessary 100%, Maha.Important, very important, okay son, you will have to study NCERT, the papers that are coming, the questions that are coming, after that you cannot leave NCERT and go, my brother, you have to study NCERT, so now let's come straight to our basic things, now we will not study in such a way that this is the octave of these, a chart has been made on the basis of bond enthalpy, bond dissociation energy, brother, write down the bond.If broken, some bonds demand a lot of energy, some demand less, those are demanding more energy, strong bonds, weak bonds, this is just a category, you do not try to make order within them, just have this chart as your reference, there is nothing negative in it, okay, we will cover all this, it is not a big deal, come, you go straight to your question, how do these things come, you will have to focus a little, so just put the heading, how many octets are in the valence shell?Electrons should be eight according to two octets. Atom tends to complete its octets in valence shell either by transferring or by pairing of electrons. What is every atom, how many electrons will it have in its valence cell? Brother, how can it do eight? Said, it can be done by transfer, it can be done by sharing, okay, it can be done by transfer, it can be done by sharing, let's see by transfer, how can it be done by transfer, this is a very old example, you haveYou must have seen that sodium is 1s 2 a2 2p 6 3s 1. Just think that it has eight in this shell and there is one electron lying here and this is s and cls12 s2 2p 6 3s 2 3 p5. Just think, there are seven electrons here. Now what can happen that in its valence shell i.e. the one which is outer most, eight are left. This brother, if one electron comes out and comes here, this one electron gets transferred, then that too eight.That is, it will become A plus and it will be left with eight electrons. Its octets will also have eight electrons and because they are oppositely charged, so how will they attract each other, A plus and C minus, which is this, they will do it with the electrostatic force of attraction and this is called ionic bond, so they explained the ionic bond by transfer. They said that look, by transfer, there is one in the octets outer most, now either these seven electrons.Eat which is not possible for this, then it is better that it will leave. As soon as it leaves, look behind. There are six and two eights left in the back shell, so its octaves are also octaves. Okay, it is a very small thing, octaves. So suppose I have taken an example here of o2. Let's learn how to make o2. Let's learn how to make o2. Come on, how is o2 made? Who will tell the valence electrons of oxygen? Tell me quickly, who will tell the valence electrons of oxygen.Valence electron is made a dot, it is called Lewis dot symbol. What is Lewis dot symbol? It is nothing. Electron, valence electron in the form of valence electron as dot present at dot. Okay, this lens, one oxygen of its oxygen, this is the second oxygen, this is the valence electron of oxygen, quickly say, six is okay, six is needed, how much more is needed, eight is needed, so how much extra is needed, two are needed, okay, put it here, now it has become six, what is this too, son, six are put here.Now what do we call sharing? What is yours is mine, but this one, these four electrons belong to him, but he has shared these two electrons.
Look, these two electrons have been put in sharing and this one has also put two electrons in sharing, so when it is counted, this oxygen which is in its valence shell will count in such a way that eight electrons are visible, its two will also be counted and when this one counts, this oxygen, when it counts, what will it also do, it will also say like this, yes, I also have eight electrons, that is, when people come to check, tell me whether your octant is complete or not, then these two areThey will say that yes yes, those ones are also mine, sharing is mine, brother, is it ours or not, they are sitting in sharing, that one will say, both of them are mine also, sharing is going on, they will say, okay, then you should be asked, friend, how many of these shared electrons are there in this, how many shared electrons are there, those shared electrons are called bonding electrons because they are the ones who are making the bonds, the rest are sitting empty, bonding electrons are the same shades, how many of these are you seeing in this, how many are you seeing in this.So, four are visible shared electrons, bonding electrons, call it anything, what can we call it, four, these four electrons are visible to you, 1 doti 4, then you are asked, well, how many are these bond pairs? Now whenever something comes in the form of a pair, we have to divide by two, that is, we always mean bond pair, son. Bonding electrons have to be divided by two, that is, if you divide by four, then look, two bonds are visible, these are the bond pairs.This is also called bond order. This is also called bond order and this is called the number of bonds. It is the same thing. Bond pair means the number of bonding electrons. Divide it by two. It is two pairs. What is the meaning of divide by two? Only then will the pair come out. Okay, only then will the pair come out. So that would be the same thing, not 20 shoes and 10 pairs of shoes. So that is one pair. The form of pair means as many.That's the bonding electron, divide it by two, that's your bond pair, that's your bond order, that's your number of bonds, now that's the matter of bonding, now I write that which are the non-bonding electrons, said, there are also those who are non-bonding electrons, how many non-bonding electrons are there son, one doti char, remember these terms, I will not teach you again and again, 1 doti ch 5 6 sa eight eightHere I am writing the total, the first thing is the total, so how many are there, eight electrons are visible, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Now if I want to write these in the form of pair, what will you say? Now should I say non-bonding pair? Now what will you say? Sir, if it is in the form of pair, then obviously here we will divide by four. We will divide by two. What are these called in the form of pair, they are called son-in-law.What are pairs called? We call them lone pair. The more common term is lone pair. Later on, the more common term is lone pair. But take care of lone pair. Son, only lone pairs are non-bonding pairs. So, such electrons which are in the valence shell but are not participating in bonding, then those who are participating in bonding are bonding pairs. Now listen to this in any act, this is a big thing, anyWhen we do sharing of atoms at the time of sharing, then when will the act of any atom be considered complete? When will the act be considered complete when its bonding and non-bonding together become eight? Look at this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Look at this green circle, in this green circle it also has non-bonding. Of this oxygen, 1 2 3 4 four have become non-bonding. 5 6 7 8 and only four have become bonding, that is, thisThis is the meaning of the circle. The meaning of this circle is the same that both the bonding and non-bonding around an atom together should be eight, we call it octets. So you look at any one atom, look, count the bonding plus non-bonding around this atom, that is the same eight. We know there what happens in octets in the case of sharing. By mixing bonding and non-bonding, there have to be eight electrons. Listen back by mixing bonding and non-bonding.There has to be eight electrons, this is the sharing, this is called octets and if bonding and non-bonding together there are more than eight, then we will discuss octets compounds later, but for now, see what you can see, here we are going to do all those examples.
In which the octet is being completed, you will remember son, let's do a small task easier than this, come on let's do an easier task than this, the same thing was to be done earlier, however but cl2 Look, how many chlorines are there, there are seven, for seven, put these seven on the other chlorine also, take seven, put seven, chlorine's valence electrons are seven, right here, just think, I will mix its bonding and non-bonding, only then it will have eight electrons, I will mix its bonding and non-bonding, only then it will have eight electrons, i.e.Octets should be non-bonding. Now for this you tell the bond pair. You will not write again and again bond pair one. Now bonding electron two, I will not write separately for each denominator because it is asked more. Brother, tell me the total loan pair. One pair, two pairs, three pairs, four pairs, five pairs, six pairs, these are six pairs. Count them. There are 12 non-bonding electrons, there will be six pairs, how many pairs will there be son.Right, you can tell this thing for n2, for n2, what is A for n2, its valence electrons will be five, okay, it is done, now see here, octets will also be formed like this, octaves are also octaves, you will be asked, brother, tell me the lone pair, tell me the lone pair, then you will say, two, tell me the bond pair, brother, then you will say, oh, three, that's the same bond order, that's the same bond order, that's the same bond number, that's the same bond order, as many bond pairs as there are total, same number.Off bonds are clear. Come, come, come, very good, very good. Now accept it, brother, we have such a sharing that we know that there is oxygen here and there is oxygen here too, its demand is known that it also needs two electrons, the other oxygen also needs six, so the demand of both is the same, when the demand of both is the same, then it is easier for us to make structures, but if the atoms are different, then now these atoms are stuck.If different, how will we make Lewis dot structure? How will we make it when atoms are different? Suppose you have to make Lewis dot structure of CO. I will tell you a trick. If you do not apply it on any other compound other than the one I am telling you, then I will not tell you. Otherwise, I will directly tell you the trick I am telling you. First, take an oath that you will not apply it anywhere else except these compounds. Only valid for the compounds which follow in the octaves that itsIs it single in the middle or is it double in the middle or is it triple in the middle? If you know this electron in the middle, then just a little while ago I had said one thing that I had said that the octets of any atom together with the bonding electron plus the non-bonding electron must be eight. Did you say it or not? So if I tell you now, I said just a little while ago that the bonding electron and non-bonding electron of any atom will together become eight. So, if there are so many octets, then how many non-bonding electrons will there be?He must have said, Sir, this is very easy, so put the remaining ones, what else, I am saying that by combining these two, there has to be eight electrons in this circle. These are the octaves required. If I tell you the way to get the bonding, then subtract it from eight and put the non-bonding. If you know that the bonding electrons are six, then see how many will you put there. He said, Sir, if there are six bonding, then put two non-bonding, why because together.Sir, together there are only eight, this is what the oct rule says, there should be eight together, this is what the oct rule says, no other rule says this, the oct rule says this, so that is why I am saying that if I give you a method, you do not use it further, then I give it to you. Well, if I tell you that in the middle, you have to find the number of bond pairs, if you want to find the number of bond pairs, then the first thing is to find the pairs, then I have already divided by two in my formula.Or it would have been better if I had to do it in two steps, then I would have said that if I had taken out the number of bonding electrons, then I would have taken out the number of bonding electrons, then I would not have divided by two, then I would have divided the result, then if I had to take out the number of bonding electrons, then I would have removed the divide by two here, but I have divided it by two because I directly tell you in the form of the bond, that is, find out whether there is one bond in between or two.If there is a bond or three bonds, then if you want to find it then you can do it directly. Direct means divide by two and put it in simple form.
The thing is, this means here the total required electron, total required valence electron minus total available valence electron. Now remember this in total required valence electron. This total required valence electron means son, every atom is divided into eight. So remember that every atom is n * 8 n * 8. This means n means the number of atoms as many atoms are there in that molecule.For two reasons, asked that carbon, tell me what is your requirement, he said eight in the valence cell, asked oxygen, tell me what is your requirement, said eight in the valence cell, the requirement of all of them is eight, only octets, if this formula works, then how much is the required valence electron of each one, he said, multiply the number of atoms by eight, that is the total, then because every atom wants that it should get the electron from me, everyThis is what the atom wants: According to one minute, okay and these are what are the valence electrons in actual and I have taught you to calculate this means how many valence electrons are there in the pre state which is available in actual. If he has carbon like himself then his valence electrons are four, if not then his valence electrons are six.Valence Electron in Free State If we talk about it then it will be Valence Electron in Free State i.e. what I taught you in the beginning that how many valence electrons each has and this is their demand i.e. the requirement, so now if you are asked to tell its requirement then how do you find it for S, how to find it for C. If we want to see, how many atoms are there, there are two atoms, then if I take out the bond pair in the middle, there are bond pairs, right?If I remove the bond pairs, what will I do? 8 * I will make two. Okay, 8 * 2 minus how many are available. 6 4 p 6 and divide by. What will I make into two? How many are there? 16 - 10 Divide 6 Divide Batu How many are there three bond pairs, that is, the simple thing is that this will not be the structure, this will not be the structure, this will be the three bond pairs. As soon as you put it, you will know that brother, this carbon hasThere are six on this side, put two. Then here also you will come to know that oxygen has also become six on this side, put two, this is what has become of its Lewis dot structure, what has become of it, son, it has become of Lewis dot structure, what has happened to this, it has become of Lewis dot structure, Vivek is saying, make no3 minus 4, how did 6 come?How many valence electrons are there in carbon? How many valence electrons are there in oxygen? Six. I had already told you, son, if you remember this then come with me. Otherwise, get down. If he is able to do it then it is okay, then go down here. The valence electrons of carbon and the valence electrons of oxygen are those which are actually available with them. We will ask carbon, how many do you have, brother, he said four, Oxygen asked brother, how many do you have, he said six, okay now both of you, tell me your demand, he said eight.I also want eight, so you will remove the difference. He said, 16 and this becomes 10. We have a difference of six electrons. To remove the difference of six electrons, we will have to make three bonds in the form of pair. So whatever is missing, we will put it in sharing and here is how much is the deficit. Can you do this work for ozone, son? Ozone Lewis dot structure, how many oxygen are there? He said, three is good, we have to remove the bond pair, do we have to remove bond pairs?If we want to find out the number of bond pairs then what will we do? We will do 6 sorry 3 * 8 because there are three atoms of oxygen oxygen oxygen is three oxygens minus each oxygen has six i.e. if you want then make it 6 or 3 because all are the same so I have not put plus no all are the same all are oxygen divide by two tell me how much is 24 minus 18 divided by two how much is this also 6 divided by two how much is itThree bonds will come, brother, I have come to know that there will be three oxygens in the middle of ozone of ozone, such ozone means there will be three oxygens and this can be the way to make three bonds, one single and one double at one place. Cyclic structure is fine. Don't think that it is unstable. Many children here tell me like this, make it cyclical.
Cyclic is a highly unstable structure, it is just a product of your brain and nothing else. Apart from this, you must be thinking that if you put one here or two, that is the same thing, that is not a big deal. Okay, so this can be the way to put three bonds. How will you put three bonds between these three atoms in this way, you will put three bonds like this, we have put the octets of Jan like this, now we have put the octets of Jan, so one two, how many ch's are left.Because I will not make this circle again and again by joining here and here, please assume that the meaning of this circle is that take bonding and non-bonding. Okay, brother, think of this oxygen, one, two, three, four. If four of it go into bonding, then only four will become non-bonds. Come, think of this oxygen, one, two, three, four, five. So, this oxygen has six electrons in bonding, so it means that only two will be left. Brother, how are there five bonds of carbon? Where was it told that there are five bonded carbons, there are five in it.Where do you see five bundles of carbon? Brother, I have not made five bundles. If you are seeing five, then it is a different matter. I can see only three. Whatever, go friend, this is the structure of ozone. Similarly, you can make co2 of co2. Look, how many total atoms are there of co2 carbon and two oxygen? If I talk about A, how many are there, the total atoms are three, so it means 8 in 3, what should I do minus four of carbon and two of oxygen.Divide six oxygens by two. How much is it? 24 minus 16. Divide by two. Do I do it again? How many bonds will come? Son, will four bonds come or not? Yes, divide by two, that is, four bonds will come. Now one carbon has been placed in the middle, two oxygens have been placed here and there and one carbon oxygen has been placed here. Said, sir, why did you put two because there are two ways in which four bonds can be formed, either double on both sides or one.There is a triple on one side and a single on one side. Now if you put a single here and a triple on the other side, then it is the same thing, but there is no other way except these two. Apart from these two, there is no other way by which you will be able to make four bundles, that is, you have to make four bundles in this way, now you complete the octad of this oxygen 1 2 3 4, then four will be left, take this oxygen also complete it here, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 is done.Look at the octad of this carbon. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 of the carbon, eight of the eight have been bonded in the bonding itself, that is, there will be nothing left of non-bonding, otherwise leave it, then do not put it because together there are eight on both sides, so look at this carbon of this oxygen, one two three cha pa pa 6 sa, come brother, look at this oxygen, six is here, three bonds means six here, so put two there, eight of this carbon is also seen six.Here there are two, here there are two, there is nothing left, so nothing has to be added, okay, this is co2, now these two structures of co2 have been formed, now we will find out which one is more stable, which one is different, I will come back to my point, sir, if there is a minus, then what will you say, if n3 minus comes, then sir, does minus mean less or more electrons? Tell me quickly, sir, one electron is more, minus means there is one electron extra in this molecule.Apply a little common sense in this formula. We wrote required valence electron minus available valence electron divided by two. My question is, where should I add that extra electron? Minus means one electron, one minus means one electron more. Now one minus one electron more, so by adding to the required, only available is more. We have more. Son, where should I write in available only, common sense.If there is a minus in any structure, then add it to the available one. If it is a plus, then subtract one from the available one. If there is a plus, then reduce it by two. If there is a value, do more. Minus means more electrons. Plus means less electrons. So, this one is according to the plus and minus. When you see the plus and minus, then according to it, you have to make a change here because in our availability, there will be more or less requirement, so everyThere are that many atoms, they said, I will make only eight, but if there is a minus, then if there is a minus, then we will have to increase or decrease the availability. Okay, so now what do we have to do, this is an extra electron, this is an available one, if we add one electron to it, then the required nitrogen is three, so I make it into 3. Okay, after that, by doing the minus, each nitrogen has only five valence electrons, son.
Every nitrogen has only five i.e. 15 p, let me make this one electron, the extra one is the same one electron, n3 mi, what you are writing, this is the one extra electron pair, isn't it, and how many valence electrons does each ni n have? If there are five, then I have made it 15. Now see how much it has become. Now see again how much it has become. 24 mi 16 diva ba 2, you will make four again.Only bonds will come, that is, there are four bonds in three nitrogen, now there is only one way to make four bonds in three nitrogen, either double it on both sides or make it single on one side and triple on the other side. Is there any other way to make it? Apart from this, the structure of the aside ion cannot be formed. Octets will not come. Two here and six here of this nitrogen, one two, three ch, 6 g here, two here and two of this nitrogen, six here and two here.If it is already ready, then nothing will come here. Octets are okay in all the bonding and bonding. Brother, come on. Yes, now many children have started asking questions. Hey Sir, now the oxygen has increased and decreased. So son, one topic is still left. Formal charge i.e. when a compound is formed, when Lewis dot structure is formed, then it is important to listen to me in the business of sharing. If the business starts, then profit and loss will be calculated separately, that is, now.The next topic that comes is formal charge. What is the next topic son? Formal charge and let's understand that topic. Come on, formal charge. Now what is the meaning of formal charge? First of all, tell me what is the meaning of formal charge. Here is the formal charge. You are afraid of this formula, I will make you fail this formula too and later on you will not let me feel the need for this formula. I will make you feel this formula too and later you will also feel the need for it.I will not allow this to happen. First of all, write a definition of formal charge. Extra charge runs automatically. My board has come out with extra charge present on atom due to gun and loss of electron. On any atom, charge will be plus. Minus will come to the atom. What is the reason for the atom to lose charge? Brother, either a man came out of the house with a drop and the charge fell, then it means that now he has lost at five o'clock or he came out of the house with a drop and found the charge lying on the way.Passed 15. In total, how much extra is coming out of the house which was taken out of the house? If we find out the difference, then our extra charge will come i.e. carbon comes out of the house with four electrons, why because the valence electrons of carbon are four, oxygen comes out of the house with six electrons, why because its valence electrons are actually only six, but in that particular Lewis dot structure, suppose we made a Lewis dot structure and in that particular Lewis dot structure you saw that carbonHe is having five electrons, so you called Carbon, come here, come here, how many did he leave the house with, he said, Sir, how many did he leave with four, he said, he has five in his pocket, brother, why is there a formal charge on it, because you have written 4 - Pa, what have you done, 4 - 5, how many should be there in actual, there should be only four in the free state, he had only four of his own, today he has five, you can see him in some structure, my dear.If you have five, you have only four, then what is the difference? Nika said, get 4 minus. When you get 4 minus, the value will be in minus and that will be its formal charge, minus and that will be its formal charge. What, son, is it minus and suppose oxygen is taken from the house, it will be taken out in some structure. You saw that he is getting seven. Bo, friend, what seven do you have, how much did you get, say, do it like 6 minus, Maiv.Formal charge has come. Suppose, after taking Ch, we are getting only five, then say, do 6 minus 5. Now formal charge will be plus and why. Because now you are getting 6 minus, it means that in total, as much as there are valence electrons in the free state, how much of it is given in the Lewis dot structure, if I make that minus then my difference will come and that is called the difference. Formal charge is called the formal charge on an atom. The formal charge on an atom is the same which is a difference.The difference between how many electrons he had left the house with and how many are still in his pocket, this difference is its formal charge. Son, what will be the difference, what will be the formal charge of an atom?
Is charge the increase or decrease of electrons i.e. when will they be less and more? Either there must have been gain or loss. This is the formal charge. Okay, so gain and loss of electrons. Add more. Brother, a child has also written in the comment. Thank you child. Thank you Babu. Extra charge present on an atom due to the gain and loss of electrons. Okay, and we will see this in the Lewis dot structure. So see the formal charge on an atom in a Lewis structure which we have created behind.You have learned to make Lewis structure, you have learned to draw it, that is fine, so see how to extract the formal charge in it, so let me explain to you, so my point is you are extracting the formal charge on the molecule, first thing, give me the answer to this question, are you extracting the formal charge on the molecule or on the atom, are you extracting the formal charge on the molecule or on the atom, say sir, atom on atom means now we have to be a little selfish in that structure too and look at the atom and not at you.How much ya won't eat than that, better get some milk and yes then come on, no problem, let's go atom p, it means atom p, now see, understand the meaning of this formula, son, understand the meaning of this formula, why this formula has been made like this and later shoot this formula from my side, but for now, I will also make you fail in this formula that why is there half here, here in valence electrons here, why half in total number of non-bonding.It is not felt and why it is feeling half, I will tell you everything. Look, in bonding it has scored half, but in non-bonding, why has it not scored half? Do you understand what I am saying? Come, I want to teach you the same. Let's take a small example of what we have just taken. Let's understand it for this. Come see and listen. This loan pair was placed here. This loan pair was placed here. Listen, you will enjoy what I say. First thing, you will enjoy this.Should I find out the formal charge on this atom and should I find out the formal charge on this atom i.e. will I talk about atom atom? He said yes sir and when I talk about atom atom then now I will talk like this. Is this done sir? This was their business. They did business together. Two people did business together. In the eyes of the world, both are partners but both of them partners will calculate their profit separately at the end of the year i.e. brother, when I did the business, how much more did I spend, how much less did you spend, all the calculations are done.In the eyes of the world, it is a company, but somewhere the two owners of that company will calculate their profit, because the formal charge will be calculated separately on the owners, that is, it will be calculated on the atoms, that is, now we will not talk like this, the date is complete, now the big things have been done, now the time has come that brother, calculate your own share and after calculating your own share, think in your mind that friend, what is on his side is his and what is on his side is his direct account.It is said draw a line in the middle brother, what did you say, draw a line in the middle, whatever is on its side is his and whatever is on this side is his, this is the meaning, now think for yourself, did its non-bonding electrons get halved when you drew the line? Look, you will not find such an explanation anywhere, I am also guaranteeing this, I am not exaggerating but yes, I am taking a guarantee. Look, did you draw a line in the middle of its non-bonding electrons? Is that why half was not put in front of the non-bonding electron in the formula?If you say non-bonding, it will be as many as it is, look at the calculation, but you have drawn a line in the middle of its bonding electrons which were one doti f pa 6, that is, you have halved the number of bonding electrons, because only the bonding electrons were there, they were in sharing, so it means that it is actually half of the sharing thing, so it will be only half of the sharing thing, right, this was with this person, this was with this person and this is with him only, that is, non-bonding is of this only.It was his non-bonding, it was his issue, this is who will have to do the half which was done in sharing, hence half has been put in this formula, now you will say, the formula itself has been explained in a terrible way, the formula itself has been explained in a terrible way, this master has explained it in a terrible way, yes, it is very easy, now tell me, will you remember this formula?Valence electrons in the free stay, how much did he leave home with?
Hey brother, Carbon will say, brother, what is this, how much did he leave the house with, how much did he leave the house with, now you have to find the difference, ok, okay, he came out of the house with four, he said, okay, he left the house with four, he said, how many lone pairs does it have right now, look at the total number of non-bonding electrons, how many are there, and look here, how many are the total number of bonding electrons, subtract that, the whole calculation will be the same, now you can follow this formula also.Kill me, now you shoot this formula also, he said, this formula is not needed, I am saying that it is a straight calculation, MDJ, you know MDJ, son, those who know me must know about it, MDJ is very comfortable, it is okay, even comfortably than Amul Macho, MDJ means my name and J for Jugaad Mohit Dad Jugaad, it is okay, so play MDJ and you have to play a strong tune, MDJ P Does MDJ say what is the formal charge?Is on atom is equal to two, there should be as many as there should be, minus as many as there should be, now these should be as many as there should be, what is the meaning of this, son, valence electrons in free state and it means valence electrons in the given structure, there should be as many as there are, minus as many as there should be, now there should be as many, I do not make it eight, that is a demand, okay, so their octets have been written, as many as they should be, meaning, valence electrons in free state, I have taught you about valence electrons in the free state.At the beginning I had said that son, if you do not know the valence electrons, then do not go ahead with me, tell me how many valence electrons should be there, he said, there should be four, how many are there now, one, two, three, get it brother, Om form minus and that is why the boy who was saying, I was wondering how five electrons came into the valence shell, they have come, then the question has come, son, one is extra, it is not there, he said, how many should be there, from the house to the house, how many are there, one, two, three, o, now there are only five.It means plus and take bhaiya Om is formed, its formal charge is done, brother, get the formal charge of ozone, get the formal charge of ozone, tell me right, now come back to this, you have made it from the beginning, how to find out its formal charge, how to find out its formal charge, said, feel that whatever is on its side, it should be its six, 1 doti 4 pa 6 sa seven, how many should there be, 1 doti 4 pa 6, how many should there be six, zero, how many should there be six, 1Doti 4 pa five hai plus clear, took out the formal charge, why do you take any tension, do you sir, do you take tension, see how much should be taken out in such a jerk, to take out the formal charge, said six, still how many, said, how much carbon did you take from the house, four, still said, did you take zero, how much did it take, six, still said, how much did you take, said six, did you take zero, said, wow sir, there is no charge on anyone, no, all the formal charges are zero, said look at the one below.Let's take a look at the two structures below, how much should there be a g, how much should there be a seven, how much should there be a -1, how much should there be a -1, how much should there be a four, how much should there be a four, how much should there be a ch, how much is a doti, five, plus and a minus, minus and psv are satisfied overall, hence there is no charge on the molecule. According to the charge, the structure below is also being satisfied and the structure above is also being satisfied.That is, overall molecule requires zero charge. There is zero and no extra charge is coming out. Okay, call it A and call it B. Now write A, put a note and write two notes, write A is more stable due to absence of charge. See, charge always comes unstable. If there is a minus at its end, then if there is a minus and charge on this atom, then this part of co2 will always think of plus, where is plus, where is plus.Where is the plus, where is the plus, why did they say I am a minus, then where is the plus, where is the plus, where is the plus, where will it continue like this, this one will always dream of minus at night, my end is plus, I wish there is a minus, charge always brings unstability, charge means loan, what is the meaning of charge, son, loan means in loan, both the one who has given the loan and the one who has taken the loan are not happy. If I lend money to someone, then I will also be unhappy with the one who has taken the loan.I am sad that I have to pay and I am sad about the fact that I don't know when it will come, that is, just charge, basically, charge is the debt of the electron. Now the debt of the electron comes with instability, trouble, trouble.
Stress comes, anxiety comes, depression comes, now this structure is in depression, that is why whenever there is a possibility of making such a structure in which no atom has any charge, it will be considered stable, only that will be considered stable. What is considered stable? Abhi Singh is asking, will any girl do friendship, see brother, Abhi Singh, if you want to make any friendship, Abhi Singh is giving open recruitment, vacancy has come, open recruitment is direct recruitment, direct interview is direct.Look at the interview, don't give any exam right now Singh has issued an open recruitment, see if there is anyone, if anyone is interested, then the vacancy has come, now according to Singh, Sir, you are a goat, cut it, Khaja brother, see, if your wish is there, now open recruitment has come, take the open recruitment from Singh, now look, there is a minus in it, it means that whatever charges will come from them, they will not be satisfied, like if plus or minus in co2 becomes equal, then you will not be in it, friend, okay.It's a simple thing, so come now see, how many should there be five, how many are there now, brother, how many should there be, Om, minus, and one couplet, how many should there be, five, brother, how many should be four, brother, plus and Om, how many should there be, five, how many are, Ch, brother, Om, how is it, don't you know, one, two, three, these are the dots, oh, your bindis, count them, brother, how many should be five, how many are five, wow, how many zeros should there be, how many are five, how many are four, wow, the float.How many should there be five, how many are seven o mg minus two, according to the charge, look at miv miv minus two pv minus two and one of plus one, one of minus one will be left, see that one extra of minus is coming, one miv of minus two plus will be left, satisfying the charge, now you are doing both the structures, there is no such structure in it that if you go out without charge, then the issue is that you have to take the loan, then all the people in the house take it equally, so don't take it in such a way that thatBrother is not taking any loan and this brother is completely drowned in debt. Minus two, that is why A is more stable in structure A and B. Why is A more stable?In the state and here, the one who is in the dream of highly minus highly polarities, he does everything by thinking about the plus, but here there is mive pluv mive symmetrical charge distribution, the charge is divided in equal parts and divided into equal number of atoms means that there will be a little more stability. Now it comes to the question how a child is asking how to find out that the molecule is octaves.Not equal to 8, this will be the meaning, what will be the meaning of oct, what will be the exception, whose valence electrons will not be eight, the same will happen, in a way, now, which are such species, the first species comes, son, in this, hypovalent species are called electron deficit and this is what it is, in these, the valence electron is less than 8. If the valence electron is less than eight and the species is stable, then it is hypovalent.There are species and that is the first exception of Tet's rule. Like, as an example, suppose I wrote B x3, what have I written son B x3If he gives one of his electrons then it is okay, then it means that here any X will come here and will give his electron i.e.Such things have come in this, what has happened, your hypovalent compound has six electrons and it has been asked twice in NEET for bf3, how many electrons are there around the central atom in bf3, now g means less than eight, less than eight means octets, which is existing, like suppose I write here beryllium b.
Arelium ok, lens, how many electrons are there, two, I have put it here, what is it, I have putA Is this electron deficiency minus? If it also has eight electrons then alf3 is also like this. alf3 is also like this. If you think that alf3 is also sitting like this by forming three bonds then this structure itself is wrong. It is not only Kovalenko valent, it is also ionic. What is this also son, is it ionic i.e. aluminum 3 is in plus and f is in minus. Now if you think f is my.If you go and check alf3 then it also has full eight electrons and if you look at aluminum 3ps then it also has full eight electrons. This electron deficiency will come but it will not come in the starting, so I am just giving the example. The place of alf3 is good, it is important to get it done at the right place, that is why I am getting it done, but you will get the confidence only after the entire chapter. I am telling you again that the confidence will come only after the entire chapter. Whatever is there, alf3 is ionic.Ionic means the way P and C minus were formed, son Y is formed in the same way and it means its octet is also complete, its tat is also complete but A is not complete of C3, nor is AB of B3, nor is A of A3, why because it is Kovalenko or it is called super octets, pending octed, now it means such compounds in which valence electrons are more given, so we have given less in it, brother, let's find out, write it in reverse.Yes, it is correct that more than a valence electron is more than aa. Let's talk about such examples. Suppose we have taken pcl5 phosphorus has five electrons, one two three char pa will form five bonds from all five. This is s s s s s and if you see then one doti ch pa 6 sa 88 9 10, how many electrons are there, brother, 10 electrons, look at this, but the compound exists, it means that there are eight in octets.Now see how many bonds will be formed around it. Two electrons in each bond. Will there be 12 electrons? See, why are such compounds Sir Boron and Beryllium not ionic bonds? Son, this is a very advanced thing.Now you will not understand, I said, remembering the example, Manoj is saying, I cheated on my girlfriend, it's okay son, everything is fine right now, you are all fine, I drink your tea, once you start moving forward, it takes time in the beginning, then you will get speed, then things are more organized, here things are not organized, initially these things are like this, a little, you will not be able to know right now whether it is ionic or that, all these things come to know later, gradually.When the electronegativity difference is very high, then it forms ionic bonds between the atoms. At the initial stage, you can think like this. Come, rest of the exam we are conducting now, be happy. Okay, it is a bit like that as soon as you read the Octed Role, you have become knowledgeable, you cannot be omniscient, there is a whole chapter left, how will Aini find out, wow brother, even we were not able to find out, then comes the third odd electron species, odd electron.Species d electron species means species in odd total number of electrons are present in odd number so those octets common most important which will come for you most important odd electron species odd electron species example which is directly asked which of these is odd electron species first one is a no2 ok n2 clo2 ch3 cf3 cl3 extra I am saying againNow, it is not that all these d electrons have been exhausted but there are not too many, not too many, there are no more electron species, there are some, out of which it is given in NCRT, only A and no2, what does it mean that brother, after the bond is formed, after the bond is formed, that is, if you count the total electrons in these species, then you will get the total electrons in odd numbers.
No, if you sit down to count them, what will you get? You will find them in odd numbers and they will be found in odd numbers, it means that somewhere there will be one unpaired and one unpaired will be left [Music] It is given in the double bundle o Now it has such electrons but it has only one single electron left. Now when the single electron is left, see how many will be there. There are octets of oxygen which is given in the structure AC, I am making that of no2.If we talk, it happens something like this, look, now here one doti cha pa 6 sa aa here one electron is left and here again put this two Sorry, okay, so this is yours, now you have to keep in mind the empty examples, it asks direct question, see which of these is the odd electron species, then look at this, 1 doti cha pa, right, it will be formed like this, see, you all have got this odd electron species, because of this, this is our [music]Octets Child is saying formal charge is not taken out, formal charge can be taken out, there is no problem in formal charge, so take it out now, take it out, no problem, formal charge will be taken out, it will come out, see, there should be five, there should be four ps, there should be seven, there should be six, there should be zero, there should be zero, zero formal charge will come out, no big deal, no formal charge will come in it, no zero will come, see, if you take it out from here, there should be five, there should be four, there should be six, there should be six, there should be six, there should be zero in.There will be zero formal charge on both, yes, but in this, the float wave will come in no2, so I have made both the structures which are asked for, this is given in NCRT, so if you ever see the structure then you will give them, so you have to take care of them, you do not have to worry too much, they are called free radicals, what are they called many times, free radicals, these are free radicals, they must have heard the name in organic, right son, you must have heard the name free radical, this radical is an electron, it is called in the form of radical.These are highly stable species. They immediately combine with others to form a bond. Apart from that, we can see what else is there. So whatever is there, we are basically reading the exceptions, that is, we are reading only the limitations. We have done this, we have done hypovalent, we have done hypervalent. Odd electron species do not follow the octaves. Well, inert gases do not form any bonds, but inert gases also have compounds.Later we found it brother, this also became a problem, it was saying inert gas, inert gas eight eight eight and compounds of inert gas were found later, then it ended, asked him friend, what do you think about energy energy, what is the potential energy of atoms, then he said potential energy, I don't know, I don't know energy, I know octets, I may have made the ozone bent but it did not do that either.He had created ozone in this way, so for this, all the molecules should be arranged in the same way, that is, there was no talk about the shape, whether to make it bent or linear, nothing, neither talked about shape, nor talked about energy, you will understand these two limitations, neither talked about energy, nor talked about shape, nor could he give any answer to this, compounds of inert gas were found, now tell me what happened to your octaves, the game is over.Odd electron species are agisting, tell me what happened to your octal rail, said, game over, hypovalent, which have less than eight electrons, those species are also agisting, said, game is over, hypervalent, said, have more than eight, said, game is over, now it comes to the question, hypovalent species which are hypovalent species, what can they do son, what can hypovalent species do, hypovalent species, hypovalent species, hypovalent species whichThat is electron deficiency and work as Lewis acid is the way to remember which is A, remember the acceptor from A, remember the acceptor from A, Lewis acid is the one which accepts the electron pair, like for example, suppose this is nh3, okay what is this nh3, now just look, it has two electrons here, okay 1 doti 4 5 6 sa 8 will donate to the octets, son, let's say here I have someone.Electron deficiency of bcl3 type and how many electrons are there around it. Eight electrons are there. How many electrons are there around it. Eight electrons. So it will donate it and how it will become after donating. By donating this, donate it.
If we do this then we will make bcl3 and nh3 such a compound, then what will it be called, will it be called Lewis base, son, what will it be called Lewis base and what will it be called Lewis acid, then whatever electron deficiency occurs, why because they want to accept the electron pair, their deficiency is generally what is electron deficit in nature and will work like Lewis acid. Now remember son, what is called Lewis acid, Lewis base, then write separately once on the side that which is Lewis acid.That is electron pair acceptor and the way to remember is A to A. The other one will automatically remember electron pair donor. Okay brother, maybe such things are easy. Come on, what is the average formal charge in octets? There are some species in which we have found out the formal charge. Let us tell you a trick for the time being on a particular atom. Don't you have MDJ? Write MDJ, it will be easier for you to ask the question. MDJ says that friend, we will give some oxo grace.Will we do it? Oxo anaito anaito ana means the surrounding atom will be oxygen. What will be the surrounding atoms? What will be the oxygen? For example, suppose carbonate is written, sulphate is written but chlorate is written, nitrite is written atus, all these are made of acids anaito h+, put h2 co3 carbonium, put two h+, h2so 4, sulfuric acid, put one h in it, hclo4, but chloric acid, put one h in it.There are two hno2 nitrous acids, right po43 - put 3h in it, h3 po4 phosphoric acid, all these are made of oxy acids, remove their h+, remove all the h+ from all the oxy acids, then whatever anion ion is left behind will be oxo anionto oxo aniont mus, that will be oxygen, then your surrounding atom is oxygen. If there is oxygen and you already know MDJ that whenever oxygen in the world, oxygen will be double bonded, isn't it oxygen whenever?What will be double bonded? If there is double bonded oxygen, then what will be its formal charge? What will be its formal charge? What will be the formal charge of double bonded oxygen? Go check it now. How can it be double bonded? It can be like this and there can be one bond on both sides. What will be the formal charge of single bonded oxygen? What will be the formal charge of single bonded oxygen? What will be the formal charge of single bonded oxygen? Will it be -1? I told you all about ozone, ozone, where did we go?Take our ozone, you will get everything in it. Single bonded oxygen -1 formal charge. Double bonded oxygen. Zero formal charge. Triple bonded oxygen. Look at this. There can be two here, one here or three at a time, like there was in carbon monoxide. One, two, three. If you are seeing an oxygen making three bonds, then write a float on it. Formal charge. If you are seeing an oxygen making a single bond, then write -1. If you are seeing an oxygen making two bonds, then just write zero.By drawing this attention, now I am going to make your work so easy that you will think what has happened. Yes, now this means here we will write triple bonded which is needed, although we will not need it, if it is triple bonded, then formal charge will come up. If it is triple bonded, it can be like this and it can also be double single. You have to write the total A, what is there on both sides, what have to be written like this, okay, now may I ask, what should I say about the structure of carbonate?Make the structure of carbonate, you will say, oh sir, how is this possible? Oh, this cannot be done by me, no, no, I said, make the structure of carbonate, I said, Sir, do you have to apply all those formulas, just stop that formula, which total required electron minus available valence electron, forget how many species, sir, did n3 minus sir co2 done, sir did ozone, sir did CO, that's enough, stop it.Do it, now that formula should not come to his mind again, that is, it should come to his mind for his structure but that formula should not come for anyone else. Yes, you will apply it in it and it will stick, but further I will say, apply it in sulphate, it will not stick, apply it in chlorate, but apply it in chlorate, it will not stick, so it is better not to put it in it, I will teach you in many ways right now, remove that formula, eliminate it, it means forget it, the poor guy came for those four-five species only.It was a small thing, I had taught it to us in childhood, now come, tell me an easier way, if you don't use the formula then tell me, I said sir, I will not use it, tell me, put the carbon in the middle, put three oxygens.
Sir, I have put minus, see how many said minus is two. A little while ago I told that the minus oxygens are single bonded, that is, two minuses, that is, there are two such oxygens that have a minus on them, that is, two such oxygens are double bonded, that is, single bonded, two oxygens that are single bonded, that is, plus etc. If there is nothing left, then it will be double only, nay zero, this is the structure of carbonate ion andAlong with carbonate, if you add hydrogen by making a bond in it, then the structure of h2co 3 is formed, its structure is formed, the structure of h2co 3 is formed. Now what happens in this, you all know the meaning of resonance and if you don't know, then you will learn this thing in organic in a better way. Resonance means this minus charge which is there, it will resonate with this double bond because it is conglomerate minus single double so minus.If it is single or double then it can do resonance. If it will do resonance then this minus two charge is not here. Actually these three will rotate on oxygen. So now I say that friend, the two things are there, let's say it is minus two, but in how much does this butt say, sir, it is butt in three oxygens. So tell me, is it better to say formal charge there or is it better to say average formal charge? So, in those where there is resonance, the formal charge is given to the thing which is there, a new term is given to it. AndThat is the average formal charge, then you are asked to tell me the average formal charge on oxygen. In this, you are asked to tell me the average formal charge on oxygen. What will you write in its place, what will you write instead of average formal charge on oxygen, say total charge divided by total oxygen. This is what will come. Tell me how much - divide by 2 by 3. That's it. And so and so and so and so and so and so and he asks you to tell me the average bond order. Tell me the average bond order. So total bond divided by total oxygen.Do this, these are the indigenous methods which are involved only in MDJ. Just call it, there is no concept in it, it will just do the work for you. Total bonds are visible in four and three but this average bond is ordered. The correct rule is that it says that total bonds are divided by the number of pairs which participate in resonance because resonance is of two types, equivalent resonance and non-equivalent resonance. I have discussed all the things here.The only thing to be done is equivalent resonance. Equivalent resonance means as many pairs as there are, here there are three pairs co1 co2 co3. As many pairs as there are, if all participate then it is called equivalent resonance. So in equivalent resonance, you can do this by dividing whatever is there by surrounding, so I have said this for equivalent, it may be non-equivalent.This thing will not seem obvious, if it doesn't seem then it is not the actual formula. It is valid only for equivalents. It is valid for equivalent resonance only and that too is a quick way to do it. Now if you are asked whether there is resonance, then you do one thing, rest we will do. Resonance in carbonate ions, we will do it. Because this is also given in NCRT, so what will you do first of all here.But double bundle o single bundle o minus minus, now it has a resonant structure, this minus, this minus will go here, this minus will go here, it will come here, don't you understand, this minus will go here, it will come out here, this is how resonance organic people will teach you, so what will become of this, or what will happen to this, so it will become single here because if this charge goes here, it will become double and it will become single, brother, this is what will happen, this is what will become, made right orFirst I made something different, I first sent it directly there, no problem, do it like this, do it like this, make it double bundled, make this single, and make this single, correct the rotation, that too was not wrong, okay, made this carbon, then after that what will you do here, make this double bundled, make this single, make this single and make a resonant hybrid of these, let's show in this way that in the resonant hybrid, oneThe bond is rotating everywhere, so this extra bundle is rotating and at how many places it is rotating, say, it is rotating at three places, that is, if I divide this one by two, if I divide this one by one, then this much will come here too, here too this much will come, and this much will come here too, how much will come, said sir, 0.33 will come, if you divide 1 by 3, will 0.33 come or not and one is already there, so it means everywhere.1.33 Is it a bond or not and this is what we mean
Just now, do it on 4/3, it will be only 1.33, we have taken the average bond order, right now, look immediately, if you do 4/3, then it will be 1.33, if you do 4 diva ba 3, then the value will be 1.33, I can make you feel it here, is it one bond everywhere, one one one one one one one bond, so everywhere which I have shown in full solid line, this oxygen, this oxygen, this oxygen andPut -2 outside here, it has become a hybrid of carbonate ion. Now think about the green dotted lines I have made, its value is 0.33, because this is one bond which is moving in all three places. When one rope is divided into three, then 0.33 share will go to everyone and we will give the same share to everyone by adding it to the first one. Say, how much do you have, say, take one, take 0.33 and take another, take 0.33.Take this 0.33 and take it, that is, what you are seeing here is one bond, it is actually not one, it is 1.33, how much is it, son, it is 1.33, it is very easy, this is the resonance of carbonate, okay, now you make its structure and show me the structure of sulphate, only you have to make the structure, resonance is not to be shown, resonance is not to be shown, okay, resonance is given by carbonate.Finished talking sulphate sulfur oxygen oxygen oxygen how much minus say two minus that means two singles and the remaining two become double sulphate what will you take say average formal charge -2 ba f what should you take out say average bond order 6/4 phosphate p phth minus phosphate phosphorus oxygen oxygen oxygen four oxygen three minus three single double what should I do a double -3 ba four make two average formal charge how many bonds are there make it 5/4Average bond order and if you ask the structure of h3 po4, then there is nothing, remove the minus or add hydrogen bond and it will become OO. HP4 is clear brother, go ahead, now you do this, I am going to give you some homework, the homework is one, take sulphite, take no2, take cl4, take cl3 to minus, mno4, take it to minus, ok, mno4, take 2 minus, cr4, take 2 minus.You will do it, tell me you will do it, take it, okay, those three are important, so I asked the question, what are you saying? Which of the following species can behave as Lewis base? The simple meaning of Lewis base is that the brother who is an electron pair donor is also an acceptor, now I have found out that this is not even the case, see p, it will be the same as nh3, it has a lone pair, the answer will be D. Okay, look at this, it works like a Lewis base.Why will it donate because it has a lone pair of octets and the octet should also be complete plus it has a lone pair so it can donate? Yes, if the octets are not eight then it would not have donated because first it will eradicate the poverty of its house and then it will donate the octets. Let's come next. Ch of the following pair of molecule contains odd electron molecule and n expanded. This is expanded octave. Remember what was the meaning of expanded.What was the meaning of hyper valent? So look, it is not odd. It needs odd and expanded. Expanded but not odd. It will be cut. There is odd and expanded. Here there is deficit. Cut here. Both are expanded so cut here. Odd and expanded are expanded. h2so 4 is expanded. Actually h2so 4 is basically so4 2 mine na now so4 2 mine now.So think about this in the back, 1 Doti Ch 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Here, 12 electrons are getting expanded, so they are expanded, this is what was made in the back, okay, we did not add them, I thought you will count yourself, 12 are getting expanded, so what is expanded, now h2so 4, if you say h2s, then you saw that h will only go around the central atom, so it will also put hydrogen here.So what difference will it make, we don't have to look at it, we have to look only around the sulfur, if we have to look only around the central atom, then even if there are hydrogens, it will not have any effect on the structure, don't call it expanded as h2so 4, tell me the answer, what should I do B. Anvay has come, I came last time too, Anvay, wow man, you are quite consistent, don't worry, it will remain as much as it will remain, otherwise it will be in two parts.Will teach, will leave nothing, okay, look, all these are questions of JE, I have not marked where I am, I JE are questions of meat, what are all these saying, The number of molecules and ices from the following do not have odd number of electrons, which is not the odd electron species, look, A is odd, cl2 is odd.
no2 is odd, now this no2 no2 has come twice, no matter what you have, it is not what you have, do one thing, son, put a minus in it so that we have one d electron species and there is no one. Okay, one is taken as no2 minus, then which one is not a d electron species. One, two and three, so in this we have three species which are not odd electron species, which three are the ones which I am marking with a star and thisThere is no odd electron species, rest I got it written in odd electron myself after checking it. JE Mains question is ok brother, it is easy. Now let's talk about Kovalenko valence. If we talk about all these things then put the heading Kovalenko Valent Bond Bond Formed by Sharing of Electrons. They do one thing. Let's divide it into two parts. Kovalenko Bond Formed by Sharing of Electrons. Now it is of two types, equal.Sharing Unequal Sharing In which there is equal sharing, it is called simple Kovalenko Kovalenko cut the word simple from it and cut Kovalenko from it and said that the world will automatically understand when we say only Kovalenko is equal sharing and when we only say coordinate, it means it is unequal sharing but there is sharing in both and both are Kovale bundles, I will tell you again.But according to their convenience, the books started explaining to the people in such a way that by removing the simple word from it, they removed only the word Kovalenko, started saying coordinate bond, started saying coordinate bond, but in reality, both of them are Kovalenko, but in practice, it is the same. In practice, which one is Kovalenko, valent and one coordinate Kovalenko, this one said again and again.Do the work, the name of its coordinate is enough in itself which tells it that it is not the simple one and remove the simple from it and say normal, do one thing, call it Kovalenko coordinate, the world will automatically understand that in one the sharing is equal and in the other one is unequal, but what are these two coordinates, son, it is Kovalenko valent because sharing has happened, now the sharing will be equal orIt will be unequal. Well, what is the meaning of equal sharing? Brother, equal sharing means that if this one gives one box and one electron of its own, this atom of its own gives another box and one electron, give another atom of its own, give it another electron, add electrons to it in this way, this is how it is called equal sharing, what is called equal sharing, so whatever we make of this, it will be equal sharing. In this way, we will make a box here in which both the electrons will be overlapping.They will stick, it becomes equal sharing type, you two, I will give one, this is called equal sharing, here is a different case, son, what is formed here is unequal sharing, that is, the evolution of boxes will still be two, but one will have two electrons and the other will have only one box, that is, it will donate it, it will be called A coordinate B and if you want to write it without arrow, then you can write, but the one who has given plus beyond that and the one who has.Minus will come on it, you can write it, there is no problem, you can write whatever you want, see, you can represent it like this, it is called coordinate, what is it called coordinate and it has another name, Dative Dative Bond, what is the meaning of coordinate bond, bond will be formed but sharing will not be equal, how can it not be equal, one is giving full two electrons and one is just providing the box.is vacant or that is, a Lewis acid is acting like a Lewis base and a Lewis acid, so whenever a coordinate bond is formed, there is one electron pair donor and one electron pair is an acceptor, that is, whenever a coordinate bond is formed, there will be a reaction involving Lewis base and Lewis acid. There is one donor and one acceptor. Here, there is no donor acceptor, that is, it is giving one half electron, it is giving half electron.Equal sharing, normal sharing, what do you say to the above, son, normal sharing, sir, examples of odd electron species, you have to remember, yes son, okay, you have to remember, now comes the thing, what is co-valence, now comes the thing, we will discuss further, now we have told the basic thing, one is valency, meaning of combining capacity, what is the meaning of valency, combining capacity and so on.
Divide the valency into two parts, one is tro valence and one is co valence. Electro valence is what is seen. In what is the combining electro valence seen? In the ionic bond, which we will read later i.e. what are the elements in the combining ionic bond. What are ions? The combining capacity of ion reduction is infinite. As an example, A's na is 1 and C's is -1, this is their combining.The combining capacity of the ice is called electro valence, but if the bond is coordinated, if the compound is coordinated, if Kovalenko valency, put two co for Kovalenko colate compound, right in these Kovalenko is making four bonds, so how many bonds is the carbon making, if the son is making four bonds, then you have to write in it, to count the Kovalenko bonds, well, Kovalenko of chlorine, you have to write one, why because one chlorine.If you check that one chlorine is making only one bond at a time, this is also making one, this is also making one, if together it is making four, then there is no need to say that of one chlorine, only one at a time, one Kovalenko is different, not all are one, but from carbon, four are being formed, so should we count Kovalenko of carbon, will Pi also be counted by name? Like suppose it has the structure of co2, then why Kovalenko in it because there are four bonds, total four bonds.It is two sigma pis 2 pi, both will count i.e. the number of bonds that Kovalenko is making. We should know the meaning of Kovalenko valence of 2. We cannot sit like this and give examples of Kovalenko Lacey all day long. The point is that Kovalenko valence includes sigma and pi. Sigma, whether it is coordinate or not, will be included. Even if it is normal, all the bonds will be included, which is what it is.Will there be counted, will there not be counted, let's discuss this now, wait for a while, now the question comes, species in which coordinate bonds are present, this is the direct question to remember because the direct question comes, species in which sigma coordinate bonds are present, the first thing is that you have come to know the meaning of sigma coordinate. What does sigma coordinate mean, that there is an atom which has a lone pair and aThere is an atom which has a box, it has donated it, A coordinate has become B, we will call it sigma coordinate, we can also write A and B, but we will have to put plus minus. When you remove the arrow and put the normal bundle, you will have to put plus minus. Brother, if you are abusing, then don't abuse it, friend, whatever it is, you are a spammer, I don't know what you are, but don't abuse friend, it's okay, what to do, if you don't like that thing, then it's okay.I know you also have work, but what does this mean to you, are you happy by doing all this, are you happy by doing all this, are you just why are you getting stressed, brother, you have a family, you also go ahead, ignore, he is a spammer, yes, ignore is his status, don't he have any status, he does only this work, his house is running with this, he is working by doing bad work, tell me, write some important examples in this, first of all, no2, second, o3, third, nh4.प ph4 प h3o प pcl6 mine nh3 bf3 nh3 bcl3 bf3 will be similar to what we had made, isn't it the main, mostly this will be asked from you, no more than this, don't even ask, okay, in this time your work will be done, if you come somewhere else, you will get to know, the issue is, one should know the meaning of 'y', what is it made of, yes, I can tell what it is made of, so it is made from nh3 + h+, so h+ gives the box.It gives its lone pair, I can tell you how it is made in this, so ph3 is made from h+, it gives its box, it gives its lone pair, how is h3o, so it is h2o, there will be a lone pair of h2o, and there will be an empty box of h+, it will give this, h3o, it will become pcl6, how to make it, it is pcl5, it will have a box, and s minus will come from here, it will donate, how is nh3 bf3 formed?There is a loan pair of nh3, there is an empty box of bf3 and it will donate it, if asked, it is not asked like this, he only asks which one is there and which one is not there, it will be the same, just instead of bf3, it will be bcl3, okay brother, and and and and and let me tell you, yes, bf4 has become minus, there are more, let's say what has become of bf4, how much number bf4 minus is there in this also, B A4 minus is also there in this, bf4.How will it be in minus that it is bf3 and along with it f is minus, he donated his loan pair to it, it becomes bf4, my same thing, here is b3 and here h is minus, he donated his loan pair, here it is b a4 mine, more like this, he will directly ask you.
So that you don't get worried, I am investing my time in the things that are useful. There is no need to get unnecessarily involved in the things that are not useful. One shot is going on. No one is sitting here to study everything in detail. It's a simple thing, isn't it? I have already done it. I move forward to Hypovalent Kovalenko. Kovalenko Kovalenko, what would be the sigma, normal, simple, sigma count, simple sigma, yes, coordinate, sigma, yes.Simple Pi said yes and Coordinate Pi said, this also happens, said Yes No, it will not be counted, Coordinate Pi should not be counted, do not include in Kovalenko, let me tell you, now the issue will be stuck in this, let me explain to you, come see, it is a simple thing, brother, whatever is made by equal sharing is all Sigma Simple, Simple Pi is made by equal sharing, Sigma Sigma is made by equal sharing, Pi is simple Pi.Coordinate Sigma formed by unequal sharing Sigma Sigma formed by unequal sharing Pi Coordinate Pi Coordinate What is Pi One We saw A and B Suppose it is donating it then it is sigma Now what will we call it sigma coordinate What will we call it sigma coordinate But if two atoms are already connected, the bond is already formed, sigma is not like this.The normal one is made up of a bond made up of equal sharing. Okay, after that, if it has a loan pair and it has a box, then it will donate it. Okay, what will it do to it? Son, it will donate it. Now just think that these are already connected. Yes, now we are making one more bond, so it will be called Pi coordinate. What will it be called son, Pi coordinate and this is not included in this.Kovalenko, we will never include this Pi, do the normal Pi but will not include the Pi coordinate and the Pi coordinate is too much of an example. No, don't worry, I will give you an example of carbon monoxide. In carbon monoxide, this exa was this coordinate and because of this coordinate, if I remove the arrow on this carbon, then there will be a minus on this and a plus on this.Will it come or not? That is why the formal charge on it was -1 and there was a float on it. Why was there a pi coordinate here? Now let me ask you, Kovalenko valence of carbon will not say three, you will say two, because this is sigma, this is normal pi and this is pi coordinate, so if we will not include it, then only Kovalenko valence of carbon is to be considered not three but two, one is simple sigma, one is simple pi and that is pi.Why coordinate because the carbon oxygen is already connected, after that the coordinate is being formed, charge will come but we will not be able to count this bond, in Kovalenko we do not count the pi coordinate bond because it is a temporary bond, now this is a lot of extra things going on, it will not ask, this means it is ok, I told Kovalenko that still we have to keep in mind that everything else will be included except the pi coordinate. Is there any such bond which has pi?If it is coordinated then everything is included like ozone is there in it, it has a bond, that is why we had written it in such a way that its formal charge is plus and its formal charge is minus. I said no, remove the arrow and put plus minus. You can remove the arrow and put plus minus. Do not think that plus minus is always the formal charge. The formal charge which is there will always come because of the coordinate. No, there is a reason because of which the coordinate is there.Formal charge may come every time, this may not be the reason. Oxygen may have left the hydrogen and ran away from somewhere. Like if n no2 is minus then n double bond o and o is negative, then does it mean that it has a coordinate? No, from here the hydrogen ran away in the form of h+, hence there is a minus on it, so the reason for the minus can be different. I have told such things in which there is a coordinate, it is not that the coordinate itself will always be plus minus.Plus minus plus has become minus. Now listen to what I was explaining. In this, the Kovalenko valence of oxygen is its Kovalenko sigma coordinate. Sir, why did it not write three? He said, sir, it is pi coordinate. There is a difference between the two. This is the first time that the coordinate is being connected, so it is sigma, neither will it connect.If this is also counted, then one, two, three, so write down how much of this oxygen, say two, how much of this oxygen, say one, then write this down, two, three, and one of this, okay, it was a little extra, such things are read.
Shit doesn't go, don't worry if you don't understand, then it's no problem, it's not a big deal, leave it, there is no special thing in it, okay, these are all the things, then comes the next and stronger point, Maximum Kovalenko element can be B and only region, what is the second period A, if there are two, then the value of L will be zero and one, that is, S will be there, and P will be. Okay, can there be two, that is, if D is not there, then I write it.Let us say that one valence shell will be 2s and one valence shell will be 2p. A bundle is formed from one box, so if an atom wants to make its bundle here, then it can make one from this box, the second from this box, the third from this box and the fourth from this box, that is, it cannot make more than four. There is no such thing as D here, so the maximum four orbitals are available.Orbitals are available for bonding, so the maximum Kovalenko valence will be four. Not, write it down. Oxygen and fluorine can't be shown. Why chlorine is only one? Oxygen two, one and two. Tell me, all of them will be like this. What won't be all of them? It cannot be four, but the maximum is four. It is also not wrong to say. Now, if they ask you about the third period, what will they ask you?Third period Third period elements can extend their valence beyond and due to availability of due to presence of vacant Emphasis on the word son vacant is called vacant d or betal In the third period the electrons do not fill in d but they have room which they can use because if the value of n is three then the value of l can be row one and twoIt can be s, it can be p, it can be d, so it means that there will be 3s, there will be 3p, there will also be 3d, here its availability makes them extend, accept your Kovalenko, understand my point, electrons will not go into it, in the third period, I am talking about 3d, but I am saying that if any such electrons are filled, let's assume that there are some such electrons filled and it is not feeling like making it a bond right now.If three are made, then for equal sharing there should be three such boxes in which there is a single electron, it will form a bond, but there should be more such boxes in which there is a single electron, that is why we said that it will go in equal sharing, if one atom provides such an orbital of its own, then only then equal sharing will happen, brother, so it means that from here it can excite it, see, if it is there then it can do it, then it can do it, from here it will do it, then it willNow see how it will be, if one, two and three bonds are formed, then they can increase their Kovalenko, that is, they have electrons, along with this, there is free space lying to excite the electron, that is, they can make it participate in bonding. What can they do in bonding?We do not write that there is a vacancy lying nearby. We have never written an electron in 3D while writing the confines of any third period, so it does not mean that it has it, it is lying vacant. If needed, one can send forward the electrons of one's own house. There are five rooms in the house. It is not necessary that people can stay in all five of them if needed. So, there is a vacancy lying near it. Come son, next next next next next next, this is a very simple thing.Come, now let me ask you that on this basis I will ask you some questions, let me ask you will ncl3 agist, assist and non-assisting, see bf3 agist, but if I write bf6 3 minus, then it does not agist, but if I write al6 3 minus, then it will agist, why because it is of the third period, then I write ncl3, it will agist, I write pcl3, it will agist, but if IIf I write ncl5 it will not agist but if I write pcl5 it will agist Nitrogen cannot make five bonds Nitrogen cannot make five bonds I have written ccl4 will agist but I have written SS 62 minus agist will not do On what basis am I writing all this assisting and non-assisting? Quickly see and tell me on what basis all these questions are being asked Improper Kovalenko What to keep in mind here Second periodmac
For this matter, how will Boron make six bonds, it is of second period, it cannot be made, Nitrogen, how will it make five bonds, it is of second period, it cannot be made, Carbon, how will it make six bonds of second period, it cannot be made, just by applying the same concept, I made them non-assisting, look now, look quickly, look right now, I am writing here clf3 i.e. chlorine is making three bonds, it can make it, but I should write that fcl3 cannot be made.Can chlorine only one, I write here of2, oxygen can form two bonds, no big deal, but I write of4, I write here of6, oxygen cannot form two, it will show at most one, it will show two, there are many such questions, see this on which I am putting a star, this question has already been asked in NEET, it is written in the P block, Nitrogen does not form Penta Halides, Nitrogen is saying five halogens.Can't form bond with can't form penta halides nx5 do not exist yes so five chlorine fluorine bromine nothing can't seem no no how to form five bonds to put five halogens Nitrogen is written in P block nitrogen does not form nitrogen can't form penta bond due to improper with Kovalenko so to form five bonds it must have the capacity to form five halogens see this these three questions are marked in such a way thatIt has been asked in NEET that which of these species does not exist? Okay, come on, Ch of the following molecular species compound is not Ha, put valent in mind, alf3 is ionic, beta a, a3 is ionic, nh2 plus will be something like this, nh2 p, how will it be, it will be like this, no plus, no, nitrogen has become four instead of five, anyway look at how many electrons are there, one pair, ch pa, 6 ch electrons are hypovalent.B3 is done, it was just told earlier that ch electron ch3 p means here also ch electron, so this ch electron, this ch electron, this ch electron, this is also ch electron, it is ionic, brother, I had already told you that these will be eight electrons, this will also be eight electrons. The question of JE is mostly JE Mains questions, there are many more but it is okay, mostly the same. Ch of the following Lewis dot structure of co2 is incorrect. Which of these LewisThe structure of co2 is incorrect, what does Paul's work come from, brother, where does it come from, let's unity, think well, think, there will be some calculations and nothing will happen, apply your mind, that is, make eight in the circle, just keep this thing in mind, I said, bonding and non-bonding together should be eight and in co2, we have created structures by combining bonding and non-bonding [music] eight, apply a little brain, son, don't be so hasty, don't be so hasty brother, is this bad, does zero work?Yes, why is it coming, remove it, I don't like it from the beginning, my mind is engaged, one two three four pa 6 sa 89 10 What is this happening here, what is this happening, this is what is happening, this is what is happening, what is happening is going wrong, it is happening, brother, it is happening, the next question will be given by teaching a little bit, what is the problem of nitrate ion, understand the problem of nitrate ion, son, nitrate ion, I did not give you to make it here now.I can do that thing, if you follow my trick then you will say, let's take one single, two doubles, you will do the same, I will make one minus and make two doubles, I have taught you that there is chlorate on carbonate phosphate, I don't know how many have taught you, and even given a lot of homework in the homework, but I have not given you nitrate because I know that I have to get the nitrate done, this is what happened, look, if you get one doti, then there will be a fight, hey Dada now.According to this, what would you do, minus, according to this, you would do -1 by 3, according to this, you would do 5/3. Hey, the point is that how will nitrogen make five bonds? One, two, three, if this is wrong, then this is wrong, this is also wrong, nitrogen cannot make five bonds. Kovalenko knows, Kovalenko, add no3 my to the number 11. You must have understood the point. Listen, let me explain it with a very interesting thing, you will understand this.Nitrogen has five electrons, two of which are here, okay, one is here and let's suppose two here, okay brother, nitrogen has five electrons, it is nitrogen, son, see what, it will be fun, 2s 2 2p 3, listen carefully, it will be fun, and here it is, one, two, three, now it has five electrons in four boxes, listen back, what five electrons?
Ctron is available in four boxes and it takes one box for one Bund, so first of all this box went, take it and Oxygen said, make one free oxygen here, let's go to one Oxygen, then came an Oxygen who said, I will make two Bunds, hey brother, you may make two Bonds, but I will have to give two boxes for two Bonds, so it's okay, I will make one Sigma and one Pi, so from here both the boxes are gone, from here both boxes are gone.Look at this with oxygen, now it has one box left and two electrons are left, it is in the same box, it is in the same box, take brother, now its compulsion is stuck, how will you make it if you bring it here, how can you add it from here, you can't add it like this, no, you add C, then it means that for two bonds, two orbitals are required, nitrogen has only one orbital, our compulsion is this, the orbital is one and the orbital is one andIf there are two electrons, then what kind of bond is formed? Then what kind of bond is formed? Then the bond is formed that brother, you make a coordinate, what is the deal with me son, make only the coordinate, if you want to make a bond, then only coordinate can be formed and nothing else can be formed. Now you will say, how can oxygen be made, sir, oxygen is 2 a2 2p 4, 2 a2 24 means 24, so it is one two.I will say three variables, when it took pity on Nitrogen, it did the pairing and after pairing it vacated its compartment and here, Nitrogen gave its loan pair, son, he has emptied the compartment first, how can oxygen accept? You should have asked this thing in Ozone itself, one was giving oxygen and the other taking oxygen was always vacating its compartment. How by pairing, it got a compartment vacated by pairing, why because of the amount of money in pairing.Now if this is a minus, then a hidden minus and one that has come out is the one from where the hydrogen ran away.It was visible silently and but one which has come due to the formal charge and one which has come due to the coordinate bond. Sorry formal charge has come. When I understood this thing about coordinate bond, then I came to know that Re Re Re is not minus one but minus two, that is - 2/3 is the correct average formal charge and 4/3 is the correct average bond order between and and o. So everything will go wrong if the structure is wrong.If everything is wrong then the structure of Nitrate ion is the structure of this Nitrate ion is absolutely correct. In which one is coordinate bond. I have tried to explain it a little like a child that there is one bond from one box, according to that, please understand it a little, and so I have not tried in any way, but ultimately I just remember to ask this question, you only have to keep the sum of all formal. What is the correct 49 sum of saying?All formal charges are psv, put your mind, minus two psv, minus two and how much will be the float. Take my brother, take the first wrong sum, then miv should come because minus k is two and plus is one. Over nitrogen, plus k is one. Formal charge on one of the oxygen atom is -2. Formal charge on nitrogen atom is + 1. Average formal charge on oxygen atom is - 1/3.This is also a problem and if this is also a problem, then just correct which one is left that the formal charge of nitrogen is the float. Look and if you want, you can also take it out. Look, if you take it out here and there, how much will you do? 5 My One, it is already saying plus and plus, isn't it 5 minus? The float is already saying it itself, it is itself saying plus and brother, you can also take it out if you want.Otherwise, he himself is speaking, look at it - it will be 2/3, tell me, have you understood, brother, if you are asked a little by avoiding the nitrate ion, how many total bond pairs are there, then tell me son, there are four, how many total bond pairs are there, four. If it is also said that the total bond pair is four, isn't it, and after calculating it, I will tell you whether it is three sigma or not plus one pi. Let's go ahead, this is the story about nitrate ion, according to Luc Dot.Structure Number of bond pairs around central atom is greater than four tell me now
All done, son, who has greater than four in this, who has more than four bonds around the central atom, now co3 2 minus has been made, four is now, no3 minus has also been made, now n3 minus has also been made, four is all, nun of these, everyone has four, everyone has four bond pairs, four, four, four has overturned, neither has the public overturned, nor has the Ch of the following.Pair h electron deficient compound. Brainly, who are the electron deficient compounds? Bcl3 and As3 both will become cl3. Which one is Kovalenko valent? Remember it. Okay, silicon has four brothers. Which of these species is hyper valent. Homework. Look at this, it has 12 electrons. Count it also, it will come to around 10 electrons. See, the high valence ones will help us in finding them.Hyper means there should be more than eight electrons. Well, it is hypo. It is equal. It will be the first and the second only. No, the first and the third. If you want, make the structure of chlorate and see. One single, the rest is double, one two, three, Ch, Pa, 6, how many are there? 14 electrons, 14 electrons, I had said 10. Sorry, we have also made sulphate. How much have we done? 12 electrons. So who will be hyper valent? The first third is not there among the rest. Ch of the following Lewis Octets Octets.I am not saying brother, how many valence electrons does it have, see pss now iodine has seven valence electrons, how many are there seven out of which three are useful here, then two will be left, right, and when two are left, it means how many total electrons will come out from here, six have come from the bond and 1 doti ch pa 6 7 8 9 10 so these are 10 electrons, so it has become hyper, then let's apply the mind to icl3 pcl3.Phosphorus valence electrons, out of five, three have formed bonds and two are lying here and two are lying here, so how many eight electrons are there, so yes, these octets, you can do this. Which one has the maximum number of double bonds? Put your mind to it. There are double bonds at three places. It has double bonds at two places. It has a double bond at one place and there is not even one in it. So it is increasing. If the same thing is written in decreasing then it will be fun. It is written in decreasing.If I have silicon and the oxygen has to be put at four and it has put four minus four bonds, it means that there is no double bond in it. In phosphate, it has put four oxygens but it has put one at minus three. It means there is one double bundle. Sulphate has two double bundles. And in cl4, as mentioned earlier, there are double bundles at three places, then the maximum number of double bonds are there in it. Then the maximum number of double bonds is there in it. There are three double bundles in it. Two double bundles in it, one double bundle in it. Zero double bond in it.Answer B, brother, how much has the answer become, brother B, it is easy, he said, sir, it is also a problem that how come the questions are so soon, Dative Bund is present in Dative, he said, coordinate, yes brother, what is it in ozone, I said, no, these are direct questions, he will not ask anything, he will give, do you remember it or not, then finish the matter and if you don't remember, then have fun, how many rays are there in it, I thought it will be over, no problem, anyway, now I will give you a little Lewis.Which base will be the least like to Lewis base, that is, find one which does not donate on loan, if you accept the reverse, then it is Lewis acid, then the answer will be this, then PMT Pre 2011, okay, it will come from practice, son, don't worry a bit, yes, it is clear, Ch of the following compound is not Kovalenko valent, do the homework by leaving aside the K plus and C minus, ay do this by leaving aside the plus and C minus of the homework.Now, although I have not told about the bond length etc., still do it, see what is the meaning of bond order, number of bonds, when the number of bonds increases, then attraction will increase and if attraction increases, then what will be the length of the bond, whatever it is, will it decrease, so it always goes in reverse. What do bond order and bond length go in reverse, son? Now suppose I have written here, see c double bond o three.The bond order is after that C double bond o double bond o co2 has two bond orders after that C double bond o negative o negative Now we have taken out 4/3 so 1.33 bond order is the highest bond order which has the shortest length then its length will be the shortest i.e. C should come last. Let's cut this out. Cut this out and will the one with the longest length of 1.33 come or not? Will the one with the longest length of 1.33 come i.e.that this also
Cut this answer and it will become the first answer. Son, first one is asking about the length. The length goes on. It is reverse of the order, isn't it? Because the more the order, the more the bonds, the more the bonds, the more the attraction, the more the attraction, the closer and the closer is the less length. Come ahead, you can do this, there is plus and minus on nitrogen on nitrate ion and minus two points on oxygen, so the answer is done. Do it second, which of these species?In which there is a sigma coordinate bond, this has been done, this has been done, this has been done, now this is nh4 ps, so it is in it, it means that it is in it, it is in it, but it is not in it, I have got it done, go and check, I have got all the exams done, you can see how many have been done, this is done, brother, it is in your notes, you have got it all written down, you are not stuck anywhere, PCL F assist butt.NCF does not tell why it is Trojan, Nitrogen has no vacant d orbital, this is the reason, just then if he had a vacant orbital, he would have made it, then by using five bonds, he would have excited his electron too. If there was D in D, then D would not exist. Son, the one with period can do it in 3D. Now we move towards the core section and that core section is VSC PR in which weWe will find out the geometry, we will find out the shape and how will we read which hybrid is hybrid, we will learn to find out the hybrid, the core section is the heart of the chapter in which we are going to enter, the heart of the chapter is okay, it took three hours in the beginning, there was no hope, but then there is hope, but there was not that much hope in it, let's see no matter what VSC PR is, VSC PR teaches us that balance, first write its full form, then you will know the valence.The valence shell has come again, son, will not leave you. Valence cell electron pair repulsion theory means that there will be repulsion between all the electron pairs present in the valence shell and due to that repulsion, there is a certain geometry which we will get to see and that will be called the shape of that molecule. What will decide how that molecule looks to us? There will be repulsion between the electron pairs lying in the valence shell. Okay, son, okay.Okay, so how will there be electron pairs in the valence shell? Now, there can be two types of electron pairs in the valence shell. Now we have also seen that it is as if we created ozone, so I talk about this central oxygen in this ozone, I talk about this central oxygen in this ozone, then if I talk about it, then it has become its valence shell. What has happened to it, son, has it become a valence shell or not? Now put a little mind into it, is there a loan account in it?Pair means there are non-bonding pairs too, there are non-bonding pairs too, plus there are bonding pairs too. Brother, in one's valence cell, there can be such pairs of electrons which are not participating. There can also be those which are participating, so I have explained it with ozone, so now can I write that the electron pairs that we have in the valence shell can be of two types, there can also be bonding pairs andThere can be non-bonding pairs also. Bonding pairs will be those who are participating in bonding and there will be non-bonding ones who are not doing it and whom we also called lone pairs. Remember what we told to them son, we also called lone pairs. I am remembering something. Then VSC PR tells us to do one thing. What do some call the central atom of an atom? Consider the valence shell of a central atom as a sphere. All this.I am speaking on the lines of NCRT, what did you say, consider the valence shell of a central atom as a sphere, consider it as a sphere, consider it as a round sphere, said, Agreed Sir, considering it as a sphere means that we have taken a 360° angle, now whatever pairs will be placed at this 360° angle, now those pairs can also be bonding pairs, those pairs have been made non-bonding, these non-bonding lone pairs can be those pairs thatThere may be bonding pairs, they may also be lone pairs, these may also be different in number, but you should imagine that whatever is the central atom, we consider its valence shell as a sphere, assume that it is a sphere and that sphere means 360 degrees. Now 360 degrees means that whatever things will be attached, they will be distributed in 360°, that is, the total angle we have is 3.
It will be 60° and all these pairs, whatever electron pairs are there in the valence shell, whatever electron pairs there are, NCRT says that these valence electron pairs will repulse each other, now the question comes sir, why will there be repulsion, see brother, what is there in it, said electron, what is there in this also, said electron, what will the electron do, what will the electron do, if it will not attract, what will it do, then consider a valence shell as a sphere, there are two types of things in that sphere.It is possible that non-bonding pairs are also kept the same. Bonding pairs are also kept the same. There are electrons in both non-bonding pairs and bonding pairs. Yes, will these two attract each other or do repulsion? Said Sir, if they do repulsion, will they automatically create distances from each other or not? How many will we make? Will we make so many that where there is minimum repulsion among themselves and the space to move around is 360° i.e. each other.The space available to move away from is 360°, automatically it will make such an angle with each other, we will make such an angle in the space, we will make such a geometry that it will automatically reduce its repulsion and where there is minimum repulsion, it will come to rest in that condition and we will make a geometry and name it, like suppose there is a molecule, there is a molecule, it has two bond pairs, what is there in it, son, two bonds.There is a pair, there is no lone pair, on this circle, suppose there are only two bond pairs on this sphere, now there are only two bond pairs and these two atoms are connected to each other, think for yourself that if two bond pairs are to be taken on a sphere at a maximum distance, then obviously it will have to be kept linear, then this molecule will be like this, we will get only linear, what will we get, this kind of molecule will only be linear, see, it is linear butBut think, if I now say that this is a sphere in which there are two bond pairs and one loan pair, now it also has a loan pair, can it remain linear now? It is not possible because now this loan pair will also repulse each other, son, this loan pair will press this one, this loan pair will press this one, now they will rearrange with each other, now they will rearrange and again they will be like this.You will take the maximum distance and take the maximum distance automatically, you will see that this B has come here, B has come here and the lone pair has come here, it is not linear, now it will be called bent, it has itself been sub-set, it is self-bonding and there are also non-bonding pairs, there is repulsion between them and after reaching such a state, the repulsion will become minimum, the maximum distance will become there, that molecule will appear stable and thisWe find all the molecules in the same condition where they have minimum repulsion and maximum distance. That is what we see. If you are calling linear as linear, then first it has become linear, it has adjusted itself, you are saying that it is linear just by looking, you are saying that it is bent, you are seeing for the first time. Sir, will you understand, son, it is your fault that you are seeing for the first time, wait for one and a half month, according to me.Then watch it for the first time because now someone is watching it for the first time so there can be no mistake of any master in this. Say sir when will I get a break? I am hungry brother, if I feel like it then I will give it to you. If you are not feeling it, then what is the main point to be written for this? Write every molecule which has tendency to acquire certain geometric shape in which repulsion between electron pairs is minimum and distance is maximum. My English is very strong, don't pay attention to that.Understanding emotions: Every molecule has a tendency to acquire certain geometric shape in which repulsion between electron pair is minimum. Should it be minimum? And the distance which is there should be maximum. Obviously minimum will happen only then. Second, the main important point in this is that what will be the order of reaction? What will be the order of repulsion? If lone pair lone pair comes somewhere then it is the most.After that the lone pair will be less in the bond pair and after that the bond pair will be the least in the bond pair. So everywhere because there are electrons, so the lone pair, the lone pair, which is there, they do the most repulsion.
It is written on the central atom that it creates more repulsion brother, the one who wants more space will push, a person can sit in less space, no problem, now this poor loan pair is not his fault either, brother, I will make you feel the thing, it is not his fault too, suppose this is a loan pair, this is also a loan pair and assume that there is a bond pair here and this is also a bond pair, a little while ago in the beginning IIt was told that bonding electrons are those which get stuck between two nuclei, so whatever it is, this is a bonding electron, now these are also two in number but they are trapped between two nuclei. Think, one this nucleus, one this nucleus and two electrons here. So this poor guy is happy that the one who is taking care of us is happy. Two nuclei are happy. He is angry that what have we done, we too have only two electrons in the number, right, this is a lone pair. He said, I am also two.I am the only electron but the only one to take care of it is that somewhere the lone pair itself is under the control of only one nucleus. The lone pairs are the non-bonding electrons and the non-bonding electrons will not be in the bonding region. The non-bonding electrons will not be trapped between the two nuclei. The non-bonding electrons will not be under the influence of the two nuclei. The non-bonding electrons will be under the supervision of only one nucleus and when something happens, it will be under the supervision of only one person.If someone is stuck in between two, then he cannot go anywhere. They say that you have to stay here, you will not go anywhere, but they will say that our world is so big, brothers, they will roam around, they will have fun and have fun, here and there, here and there, the lone pair, that is why the average asks for more space, says to the central atom, O brother, Oi, you have not taken one in the bonding, you calculate equally from above, come here, give me some space.Let us go, move away from here, then it will create more drama, why because there is only one nucleus to look after it, so it is free to move, you can move easily, so if it is an easy movement, then it will create more repulsion, obviously, only the one who wanders will create more repulsion, no one is wandering, he is quietly sitting at his place and will create less repulsion, and someone is wandering, this is a useless whim, this is a whim.These lone pairs are fitur, they keep colliding with each other, here and there brother, the lone pair continues like this, so they keep doing like this, that is why their repulsion is the highest, when the lone pair comes, then there will be a fierce repulsion, then one of them is fitur and one will be sensible, then a little less, both will be intelligent, then there will be less brother, that's why remember NCRT writes, lone pair acquire more average space on central atoms.Creates more repulsion and I even told the region why the average space is needed more. The region is in the grip of only one nucleus. Okay son, there is lack of attraction on it and the one on which attraction is less power, it can move around easily. One is writing, Hey Mohit, give a break, wow, what is it son, I have a problem, I only see useless comments, take a little care and if you want to eat food, then eat together, there is no need of a break to eat.Keep listening, keep going, keep eating small, no big deal, asking for a break to eat. Now it comes to the matter of overall geometry. I will tell you overall geometry. Mark important points and write down notes. Overall geometry tape of molecule depends on lone pair and number of lone pair and sigma bonds. Now the story has come. Tell the story of Pi. Where did Pi go? I said that Pi has no role in geometry. How?It doesn't happen, let me explain that there is an atom which is connected to B for the first time. The world said, wow, it is linear. From here, it is connected to B. The world said, wow, it is linear. Then he had more scope for this, he made one more bond. The world said, wow, this is linear, then he had more scope, he made one more pi bond. The world said, wow, it is linear. Well, the world is saying the most linear, that is, it is Sigma who decides that you are linear. Hey, the connection for the first time is the first.Only the connection of the bar will decide the orientation in space, so from this it will be decided that you are linear. If I hold hands with someone, if you listen to me, if I hold hands with someone like this, from here I hold hands like this, then it is linear. Now put one more stick of mine here for strength, then another thing.
If there is a stick here and put it on the other side for strength, then will the brother move away from there, will he not move? He said, put a stick here, stick a stick here, he said, strength will come, but the shape said, it is linear, what is the shape, son, it is linear, I did not understand, please explain back, when did you call it linear, you said from here and from here only, we said that it is linear, now he is making extra, so make it, it does not matter to us, that is, from Sigma only.It was decided that it is linear, now it is making a pie, but it is not making it, still it is linear, isn't it clear, brother, I am joining like this, now you are saying no, it is okay, I will add one more, so from the very beginning, it was decided that it will remain there, I have caught someone from here like this, so that's it, now in the space, my orientation has come in front of me, isn't it, it is very good, but I have not only written the sigma bundle here, Raja, I have also written the lone pair, see, I have written here.But I also wrote lone pair, what did I write lone pair, it means the role of lone pair, sir, sir, can we tell by counting the lone pair and sigma bond, what will be the geometry? 100% 100% What did you say, if we know how to count lone pair and sigma bond, can we tell the geometry? 100% Now suppose I have it here, now I have placed a lone pair here, now see the game will change.Now see whether it is bent or not, that is, even if you make a pie, it is bent, it is bent, it does not matter, it does not matter, bent, that is, the issue is about lone pair and sigma, son, that is why I said, overall geometry depends on sigma and number of lone pair, yes, if the lone pair comes, there will be a change, but if the pie does not come, then overall what do we have to focus on? He said, on the sigma and on the lone pair.Now, when you read NCERT, you may face problems, so first let me clear it, NCERT will not say clearly like me that only Sigma is useful, Pi is not useful, it will make you crazy and will make you crazy and say that you call it only one, what will it say, you do not consider it as two bonds, consider it as one bond, do not consider it as two bonds, consider it as one bond and I am saying that one of them is not useful, only one is useful, both are useful.The things are the same but NCERT will teach you one wrong thing here, then in the future it will reverse it back but NCERT says that the multiple bundles are called single super pair, what did he say, multiple bundles are single super pair, now the mind has gone crazy, bo single super pair, he is saying you don't do multiple, meaning you said, you give one pie, two pies, don't see, you single it, single super pair, he is trying to say that look brother, consider it as single only.And I am saying that the work is single only i.e. the work is sigma only, so the matter is same but that NCRT thing can confuse you at one place that if someone asked yesterday that how much pi is there in it then you will say no no, the unbroken truth of life is not single super pair, it has pi because in VSC PR it is written in NCRT that multiple bond is also single bond, we just call it single super pair, one is single pair, normal is one, one is single.Super Pair Hey brother, don't get confused, he himself is saying the same thing about pi, don't look at the meaning of pi, you just treat it as a single value and I am saying don't care about pi, if you accept sigma then it is the same thing, ok, what will happen son, it will be the same, now the question will come that if we know how to calculate, then yes, there is a type of a molecule, there is a type of a molecule, okay, there is a type of a molecule, let's assume how one is our central atom.Look at this, what is A, what is ours, son, the central atom is the one in the middle, B, what is that, is our sigma bond pair, what is B, what is our sigma bond pair, and the number appearing below B is the number of sigma bond pair, L, which is appearing below L, is our lone pair, and the M appearing below L, is our number of lone pair, that is, that is what I said, I if the number of sigma bond pair, I if the number of sigma bond pair.If I find out the number and the number of lone pair, then I can reach the geometry. He said, yes, if you can reach then there is a formula to find it, there is a formula to find it, whenever you see any molecule, whenever you see any molecule, how can you find this number in it, he said, if you see these numbers, then we will tell the name of geometry.
This is the way to calculate the number, son, that the total valence electron of that molecule is not leaving you. The valence electron. I had already told you to hold my hand, if you can take the valence electron along with you, then come. If you have a valence electron or not, then brother, come on, no problem, do not go with me. Then I had already refused. Total valence electron. We will divide the valence electron of all the atoms by 8. Whenever we do any division, hereHere comes our reminder, do you know that you have a divisor di dividend and all those dividends and all those things, so what is this quote, what is this reminder, we mean by these two, the one who comes to our dictionary, we will call it number of sigma bond pair, brother, the more Ksh comes, the more sigma bonds are there in it, the more Ksh comes, there are so many sigma bonds and the reminder that comes to him becauseIf we have to find it in the form of lone pair, then we will divide it by two. Whatever reminder comes, we will divide it by two. Do not apply this trick for odd electron species which we will look at separately. This trick cannot be applied in two electron species because odd electron do not follow octets. Why we cannot divide by eight and one more thing is species having hydrogen edge surrounding.Atom hydrogen can never complete octets. There can be maximum only two electrons, hence hydrogen also cannot get trapped in the case of divide by eight, hence neither octets will be formed nor will be formed. Hydrogen does not have odd electrons. Hydrogen never completes octets, that is why this formula will not be applicable for both. Don't worry, I will tell them separately and I will tell you even easier for those whose surrounding hydrogen is. Your work is over, for now let's see the total here.For example, suppose I write here the valence electrons divided by 8, then now I will also make a list and give you the example name. Suppose I have written the example. First of all, suppose I have made what is p Ca3? First of all what have I made is Ps3. Okay, how many valence electrons of phosphorus are there in five chlorines, how many are there in seven chlorines, how many are three, so all of them will be together, divide by 8, make 21 ps5, how many are there, 26 divides.Divide it by 8, now don't run the calculator in points. 26 diva by 8, the answer will come in points. I don't need points. I need a number. I want a reminder. What is meant by both is that I need a number. I want a reminder. So I do it like this. It is a childhood memory. 3 24 divided by y, how much will you get. Two reminders have come. Two reminders have come. Divide by 2, how much will be one more.Here comes your dictionary at What is this n What is this m What will you write ab3 l1 Will you write or will you not write? Said Sir, Now what should I do with this? Now say what should I do with this? Now you should know the name. So you should know the name. Now there are many molecules which will have different names. With this number, I will tell you the names of different molecules. Look, come, I will tell you the names of different molecules. Come, just the name because the most important thing is to remember the name, that's it.The big thing is that the molecule in which central atom does not have lone pair, first I am writing the one in which the lone pair is zero, that is, what I will write now will be A B A L zero, I will write all the zeros, yes, but whatever n is, it can be variable, sigma will be different, I am writing those ones, I come, first of all A2 A0, I am writing all the same zeros, now again will come ab3 A0 A B Fo L Zero A B F.L Zero A B S L0 A B to L0 Lo What to do is to write the name, just knowing the name is enough, Linear Triglinase Bi Pyramidal, Octa Heddle or another name is Square Bi Pyramidal, this is your Pentagonal Bi Pyramidal, these are all those which are not having lone pair, in the next I am writing the molecule which has lone pair in which lone pair is present at the central atom, that is, now our proper A A andl A will come, both the variables are that brother m was zero there only and here m which is there will not be zero, first of all ab2 l1 ab3 l1 ab2 l2 ab4 a1 a3 a2 ab2 a3 after that will come ab5 a1 ab4 a2 ab6 a1 and ab5 et although the last two cases are not in NCRT, still got it written, I will call it bent shape, we will call it pyramidal, we will call it again bent.The shape which is bent and will become isostructural will be called sisso, it will be called bent t she.
This bent is different, that bent is T-shaped, it will be called linear, behind it there is one linear and the last one will call it square by pyramidal, not only pyramidal, now everyone will come forward, everyone will call it square planar, this will be distorted octa hedal which is not in our syllabus and this will be pentagonal planar, this is also not there because there are very few compounds, there is only one compound, such type is not common, that is why they did not give it, if you know the name then you can.You can write many things brother ab3 a1 what should I write behind it if you know the name then write pyramidal if you know the name then you can do the work that means you will be able to ask the question later I will explain the shape even if look at it so3 is here son so3 is here so there are six of sulfur and there are six of oxygen too so there are six of oxygen too that means in total there are four such atoms which have six of them so it will be 24. Take it like this, let's do it.Reminder will not come, only the word will come, three reminders will come, zero means this is yours, this is yours, what will you write, A3, A0, triangle planar, what will you write, son, from triglyceride gas, there will be eight, won't I make 7*4 of valence electrons and fluorine and divide by 8 because there are four fluorines, that's it, brother, that's 36/8, do it like this, don't take out four, four will come here, 32, how much will become here, four.Reminder has come, four reminders, divide by 2, how many two will come, this is your m, this is your n, okay, what will you write ab4 l2, this is A4 A2, yellow A4 A2, square planer, the list is given at the back, you should remember it, otherwise there is no meaning, otherwise there is no meaning, if you remember, then it is okay, if not, then have fun, if you remember the one behind, then have fun, yes, if it is a minus, then what will you do, then take no2 minus.What will you do in the case of minus, it is the same thing, minus means electron extra, so in two valence electrons, minus means electron extra, plus means electron is not extra, like suppose this is no2 ps, plus and minus, then what will you do, will you make the electron less and more?And if there is plus charge, then plus means less electrons. One minute, what was going on? Negative charge. Yes, what was I telling you? If there is negative charge, then add it and if there is positive charge, then subtract everything. It is simple, less is more, you have to do according to the formula, rest of the formula is the same divide by 8, a slight modification that you have to do is to take minus and if there is one electron is extra.Let's add, the valence electrons of nitrogen are five, oxygen has six, 6 plus 6, do two plus one, do this plus one, this plus one comes from here, and divide by 8, 6 6 12, 17, and sorry, did I do it wrong, 6 6, 12, and pa, yes, it is correct, 6 6, 12, and one, 17, and one, 18, divide by 8, how much will it be, two accents will come, also give a reminder.That is, reminder, if you divide by two, then one will come, OK, so this means that ab2 and a2 will come. Alv is bent shape. How many are there of lo no2 plus nitrogen? Five oxygens are 6 plus 6, make two minus one. Do this minus one because there is less electron here. How much will it become? 16 16 divided by 8, if you do only Ksh will come two, similarly zero will come, end the matter A2 L0, make it linear.And this calculation should be done in the mind, this calculation should be done on 10-15 examples in the beginning, then this calculation should be done only in the mind, or small or big things should not be done in the mind, it is yours, do not just sit like this, do not add, multiply, divide, you will make mistakes, if you do this in the mind, you will do it in the air, then if you feel there are chances of making a mistake, then brother, write it down, that is what I am saying, but yes, if you practice well enough, then see Aa3 minus n3Minus aa3 plus try it quickly see aa3 minus three is iodine okay and add one more divide ba 8 make it how much is ba ba aa 2 b 8 then how much will it be if you do it now reminder if you divide by two then how much will come three and this is your accent how much should I write ab2 a3 linear n3 minus 5 pa pa and one why is this one because minus is divide by 8 againHere comes 16 div ba 8 two only ksh will come reminder zero so it means ab2 l 0 linear edge ide ion linear i3 p will be less this time 7 * 3 -1 divide
Ba 8 If you go one out of 21, then 20 will be 20 / 8 Do it brother, see how much is happening Ksh is coming Same two reminder is coming Four more reminder divide Ba 2 is coming Two This is done, your M is done, your N is done, this is your A2 Ltu bent take brother, now speak to your stomach, brother, I have written it wrong, printing error, what have I done brother, I have written something wrong, is it good A 2A3 will happen, yes, now it is fine, let's go brother, now it comes to the matter that all this is done, now let me do a magic, let's do a magic first, first let me teach you one thing in the case of hydrogen MDJ when surrounding atom is hydrogen because we said no, formula for hydrogen cannot be given, even if the formula does not apply, MDJ will be applied, let's apply one hydrogen, how many bonds does one hydrogen make, son makes one bond or as many hydrogens as there are valences.Electrons will be reduced by one hydrogen. The first thing in this is the number of sigma bundles i.e. A. Sorry, that is, A. That is the number of hydrogen atoms. Take it. First of all, the sigma is gone. Sir, how to find the lone pair. Lone pair will be the valence electron minus the number of hydrogen atoms in the form of pair. That's why I have divided by two. Because if I have to find it in the form of pair, then I have already divided by two. It will come directly to A. It is easier for you, I think.I am telling you, it is not very easy, just write ch4 A4. Why did you write as many hydrogens as sigma? A4 said, Sir, what should I do about the lone pair? Valence electrons of carbon are four hydrogens, how many four? Now if you divide cha by ch 4 minus ch divide by, then only zero will come, zero is equal to tetra heddle. I am telling you, it is easier, as if you saw my point, A3, as soon as you saw it, you wrote A3. Then he said that nitrogen would have five valences, how many would have gone, said three becauseMake it minus the number of hydrogen atoms. Okay, divide by two. How much did you get? By elevating, the pyramid became straight. Third, good sir. Plus is minus. Look, in this case, I will not write again and again. If plus is minus, then make less or more in it. It is okay because for the plus minus one, I have given all the formulas every time. Plus and minus means less of electrons and minus means more of electrons, so according to you formula.Make some changes in it, I am not talking about that, you already reduce one of the valence electrons, you see, let me tell you, let's do nh4 plus and let's do it, now what is the meaning of plus, what is the meaning of plus, where is one electron less, where is it less in valence, well, seeing this, write ab4 directly, now I should write it like this, 5 -1 -4, or I should write it like this, now - where is one electron?Brother, this minus one has come because of this plus, brother or divide by two, sorry, should I divide by two, how much will it be 0 A0 or should I think in advance that if one of the five goes, then four 4 My Ch 0 Lo, this will also be tetra, if plus is minus like nh2 is minus, now we know that nitrogen has only five but there is five, but I will write plus along with it, then I will write -4, sorry, I will write -2, now Ch.Of these, two are gone and then if you divide by two, then this two will come, so you can also do it like that there are five, one more and add six, how many two are left out of six, if you divide four by two, then you have to halve because you have to write on the loan, the answer will be A2, A2, what will happen to it, son, how will this bend shape become, will it become B shape, tell me h2o, how many valence electrons are there in oxygen, Ch, first write A2, now there are six, out of which two are gone.Divide by two, divide it by two, it will come back to two. Take this, make it all the same. Let's go brother, you will do it. Okay, there is no problem with the hydrogen one. Let me give you one more magic. By the way, I am not even in the main batch. Let me give it to you. If you don't misuse it, don't misuse it. Tell me, don't misuse it, then I can give you one more magic. If you don't misuse my powers, I can give you one more power. Many of your tasks will become easier, but yes, there is a condition for it and the condition is this.When Halogens are Surrounding, it should be in Halogen Surrounding. When Halogens are in Surrounding, apply the concept of Same to Same. He said back, If you don't use these powers wrongly, then I will tell you, otherwise, look, if you use them wrongly, you will get into trouble. When Halogens are Surrounding.
Atom when halogen are present as surrounding atom neither halogen are present as surrounding atom is ok or think of it like this, don't write here because here you will really mix it, no, I am not writing, I am just telling you, leave it because I have had problems many times, I don't want to do this, I said, take out Axy F2 and show it, I will direct it, now you have seen that in halogen surrounding, halogen remains the same as hydrogen.Whenever there is a bond in the surrounding, it also forms only one bond. I wrote A2 and I took out two out of eight and divided it by two. Don't tell anyone I S L2 minus HA. I agree that there is halogen in the central but in the surrounding there is halogen only. It is necessary to have halogen in the surrounding. Don't tell me A B2. So I have written that now I have written that the valence electrons of iodine are seven. If there is one more here then I have added one more but minus two.As soon as you divided by two, you got three, it became linear, don't you say Sir, tell me immediately, I said, but no one will misuse the powers, believe me, no one will misuse the powers, remember, no one will misuse the powers, if xc2 f2 comes, then brother, apply the formula a little carefully, my brother, don't do it, apply the formula, its 6 and 6 have become 12, oxygen has become 14, it has become 14, divide it by 8.Give 12 8 20 14 34 Aa, how much will this dictionary come, how much will this dictionary come, four reminder will come, two reminder, divide by two, how much will come, one, this will be A for av C, 100 C, when it is mixed like this, don't mess with it, use all your halogens, use all the hydrogen, put it in the surrounding, but don't mess with it like this, but I have the trick for this too, but what will I do, should I teach all the things and then should I teach the trick also, what is the meaning?I know you will make more mistakes, take it brother, now let me do the magic, let me make sure of hybrid, I have not taught hybrid yet, but let me do the magic, sir, see how to find hybridized orbital. Hybrid orbital either forms a sigma or has a lone pair, that is, if I count the sigma and lone pair, then I will count the hybrid orbital.Brother, there are only two functions of a hybrid orbital, either it creates a sigma or keeps a lone pair, then I know how to extract the sigma and lone pair, so I know that A and A have to be added, if I add it, then I will get the total number of hybrid orbitals and the number of hybrid orbitals that come, that type of hybrid comes out. See, if two comes, two A, if three comes, A2, if four comes, sp3, if five comes, sp3d, if total comes six.If the total comes then sp3 d2 and if the total comes to seven then sp3 d3 take brother create a ruckus yes yes we have not created a ruckus yet we will create a stir bring three and one four sp3 we have to add three and one four sp3 three and zero three sp2 four and two 6 sp3 d2 two and one three sp2 two and zero two and three and two pa sp3d two and zero one two and two four sp3 40 sp3 3 one f sp340 sp3 two and two 4 sp3 two and two 4 sp3 three and two 5 sp3d 3 two 5 sp3d 5 sp3d sp3d What an atmosphere then it's right sir ji how to remember the name son you have to remember the name only then you will be able to call someone if you don't even remember the name then there is a problem then you have to remember the name I am wondering how to remember the name Hey brother everything is like this so something has to be done isn't it friend if he becomes a doctor then he will also be able to remember the name alsoYou will have to remember that he will write on the slip that you should go and take medicine for cough from the shop. I can't remember the name. He will say something like this, what can't I say, just don't do it again, then you have also learned how to extract hybrids. Now, a lot of shapes have been given in NCRT. Okay, there are a lot of shapes given in NCRT. I am not telling them because I have already told that this number of electron pairs is two, isn't it, and it is called linear.And some of their examples have been given, look at the electron pair, all these means, this is your ab2 l0, I will tell you, I will write ab3 a0, I will write you ab4 a0, you read it carefully, how many degrees of angle is there, he has also told me, son, you have to see a little, he has written some selected examples, we can work out all of them, it is not a big deal, I will not explain it because I have done this work, this is your A5.A0, this is your A6, A0, this is the octa heddle that we wrote, it looks like this, look, square by pyramidal, okay, it looks like this, so I am not getting it done because I have named
Get it written son, now this is the one in which the lone pair is present. What is the lone pair present? The bond pair is two, the lone pair is one, then together how much will it become, ab2 will become a1, this will become ab2, a1 is bent, this will be your ab3, a1, this will be your ab3, a1, this will become your ab2, a2, okay, this is ab2, a3, a2, a2, see, we have done all of this, we have done all of ours, don't worry, yes, no, it is saying thatBrother, if you don't get confused here, then the shape is bent because the shape will be seen like this, this is the only lone pair, what is this lone pair, so what is it showing the arrangement of all the electron pairs, lone pair plus bond pair, that's why it is showing like this, although it is not a bond, it is not a bond, keep in mind, this is the lone pair son, look, this is the lone pair, don't get confused, the shape is finally this is the bent, what we wrote is final.Shape is written, this is a total arrangement, say, how will be the arrangement of both, while shape is only seen, shape is only seen without lone pair, only bond pair, arrangement of only bond pair or bond pair, arrangement of only bond pair is being seen, remove only the bent tragic lone pair, shape means do not see the lone pair and correct it, this so2 is different and th is different, don't know how it is written.May be it is written in the same way in yours, then it comes A4 Alv C to A3 A2 and that linear is not there in it, I have got it done, no problem, A5 Alv and A4 Altu, change the cells, wait, we are giving them a break, as soon as this thing happens, we will give them a break in some time, then we will come later to ask the questions on its topic, anyway, this PDF is already done, come on, now we will do more questions related to this, in which you have to do maximum, after that directly hybridized.I will start the story, come brother, move ahead, so first let's remove this part and put on part two, we have already saved it again, saving no voice, now it must be coming, it is coming, it has stopped, oh give me life, let's see, let's learn about hybridized, come quickly, let's understand what hybrid is, only the orbitals are formed by joining together, that is, these hybridized of the same.Energy atomic orbitals will be mixed. There is an atom, it mixes its own orbital and creates the same orbital again, but this time it names them hybrid orbitals and makes them similar, like suppose this is s and this is p, then if we get one s and one p, then A will remain hybridized. It is more important to know how to extract the hybridized emission.The hybrid orbitals that exist participate in the valence shell only because the energy gap between them is less. The energy gap that exists is less. There is a low energy gap, hence mixing becomes easy. Because if there is too much gap, then how will you be able to mix. If there is too much gap, then you will not be able to mix. There are many things in it and let us look at all the things more thoroughly.Hybridized e-e electron has nothing to do with what types of orbitals can be. Such a filled box can be paired. It can also be like this, a half-filled box can also be hybridized and an empty box can also participate. Okay, excitation and promotion and whatever you excite the electron, you do it for the number of bonds. Kovalenko is also not a necessary condition to break the hybridized orbital.You are making it back from the same i.e. Reconstruction and Reorganization You are getting organized again, you are reconstructing again and not doing anything, you are making orbitals by breaking orbitals but what you are making is now exactly the same, they look the same, they are of exactly the same energy, so the hybridized orbitals are always equivalent in energy and shape, that is, how will they be in energy and shape.Son, they will be similar if thorets are effective and are more stable. Bond age compare to that if normal atomic orbital bond is formed then the hybridized atom will be able to make the hybridized one of its orbital effective and form stronger bond. Secondly, I told that only those orbitals will be hybridized eyes which will have to form further sigma bond or have to sit by keeping the lone pair, this was the reason why we haveBy counting the sigma low sigma bonds and lone pairs, the number of hybrid orbitals was determined and what is the difference between hybridized geometry and molecular geometry? Anshul Electronic Geometry is asking.
What I mean by looking at all the electrons, which I did not tell earlier, is that the shape that is formed by mixing the lone pair and the bond pair is electronic geometry and the normal geometry that is formed is molecular geometry and that is what is called shape. It is seen without the lone pair. Son, one is saying, sir, there is salt in your toothpaste, yes, no, why is it not there in your vegetable, what do you take my friend?Add toothpaste and have you finished the salt. Have you finished it? Is it orbital witch hybridized? I have already told you all these things. Let's talk about some more things like if we consider the types of hybridized then one S and one P will come together to become A. Here's how many will be mixed together to form two. How many two will be formed. These A and S will be arranged linearly like this. One of them is not being formed properly like this. Yes, what will become linear like this? Will it be arranged like this?In this way and how much will it become, it will be 180 degree theta, this is also a, this is also a, two will be arranged like this, if one s and two p are mixed, then sp2 will be slightly bigger and will become sp2, but what will be the name of all three sp2, how will all three sp2 be arranged, this way will go from triglinic, this is also sp2, this is also sp2, and this is also sp2, if one s and all three p are mixed here, then this will become sp3sp3 will be a little bigger than these, the shape is the same, just the size is different, this sp3, this sp3, this sp3 and this sp3, so see how sp3 will be formed, it will be formed in tetra hadron form, this way it is ok, this is also sp3, this is also sp3, these are reorganized, neither the orientation is back, their other theta will be like this, 109.5 degree tetra hadron, come on brother, let's go ahead, these are the types, A sp2 is of sp3 type, right?Hybridized, come ahead, now let's talk about hybrid. Okay, I just told you that everyone's tape is the same but the difference in size is this is bigger, this is bigger than that and this is bigger than that, sp3 is bigger than A, sp2 is bigger than sp3, it remains of size. Come ahead, now let's talk about overlapping. The first point of overlapping is the first point of hybrid orbital always form sigma bonds. Okay, so hybrid orbital whenever.Evolve will always be formed in overlapping. What will be formed? Beta will be formed. So if I say that if there is overlapping of hybrid orbital plus hybrid orbital then sigma will be formed. Even if there is hybrid orbital plus pure orbital, what will be formed? Sigma will be formed but but but but pure orbital plus pure orbital, whatever is there can be sigma as well as pi. We just have to see that, we have to read that because the question is here.It comes from here and never asks questions, what will it ask, what bond will be formed of sp3 sp3, is there any new, will sp3 form sp3 sigma, ask like this, what should I ask, tell me how much sp2 sp2, sp2 will overlap to form sigma, sp2 will overlap by 1s, will form sigma, sp3 1s will overlap, will form sp3, sp3 will form sigma, say, what will sp3 form, say, sigma, aa, how much will be formed, say, sigma, soThere is no need to ask the question, why would he ask that question when the answer to all is Sigma, then there is not much importance in the above, only this should be known that the evolution of hybrid orbital has taken place in overlapping, if there is overlap and there is evolution of hybrid orbital then it will form Sigma only, so hence the question never comes from here, the question never comes from here, the question comes from where.If there is a chance for both Sigma and Pi, then he will ask you to tell me whether Sigma will be formed or Pi will be formed, so we will talk from there, so if we talk from there, then we will also talk from there, come, okay, there is another one, son, I will tell you that later, let's talk about the types of overlapping on the basis of inter nuclear distance, this inter nuclear distance is based on this, sorry, inter nuclear axis, what am I saying friend, inter nuclear axis which isIt is said that the internuclear axis is the one on which both the atoms which are approaching to form their bond with the orbital have their nuclei. The axis on which the nuclei of both the atoms are located is called the internuclear axis Coaxial and Head on Overlapping Coaxial and Haddon overlapping This is along the internuclear axis Let's assume that we have taken this internuclear axis as the root Okay, this is what is oursNuclear axis is now on this, if I am bringing this orbital on this, then its name will also be 'Prad' and if I am bringing this orbital, then its name will be
The name will also be p root, in this way the overlapping will always form a bond, a sigma bond will be formed, what is the sigma bond formation and if perpendicular to the internuclear axis, then suppose I have taken the root axis here, the intra nuclear axis, now the orbital which is perpendicular to it, how is their geometry, suppose this p is one and how is this also, son p is one, then this overlapping will always be found from this.Bond will be formed Pi bond formation will be formed from this What is Pi formed from this Bond formation Pi is formed like this How is Pi formed This is how Pi is formed In this way and in that way there will be head on overlapping What will be formed from that What will be formed from that Sigma will be formed Okay Sigma is stronger than pi Sigma is stronger than pi because co axial always has greater extent overlapping co coaxial What is that is what is more merged Let's go ahead brotherWell, we talked about types of overlapping, but only types of overlapping will not work, then he will ask this question, then he will ask that tell s and s, if I give x and s the internuclear axis, give y, give z, then what will you make, then I will always say, we will make sigma because how is s, they said, it happens, bring it on any axis, imagine it as if you have two sponge balls in your hands, bring them here, bring them like this.Bring it like this, bring it from any axis, it will touch its surface on the same pattern i.e. always coaxial s and s, what will they be, if always co is axial and if always co is axial then only sigma will be formed. Do anything, take any axis, then o inThen I did the root, then showedI wrote s p p bhai neet aspirant is saying I need a female friend oh my god tell me quickly let's common per co axial overlapping son so vava sigma 0 so in this way you can do the question next let's next third p plus p p p peep how can overlapping be like if the first thing p a p p p taken x I asked xva and h what will you make onThen make pi i.e. sigma on common because co will be equal to pi on the rest, then you are asked that pi zad plus pi zad on what will we makeHow will be theEven if you agree, then there should be a plus here. This is called positive overlap. Same phase P, which we call constructive interference of wave. You must have read this wave in physics, but if here one sign is plus and the other becomes minus, then it will be called negative. This does not lead to bond formation. Yes, although it will form a bond, so here are all the positive overlap ones. Look, plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus sorry minus.Minus plus plus minus minus is fine but all this is negative. We say out phase overlap, they do not form a bond. Plus minus minus plus plus plus minus minus plus plus minus minus plus. And there was a zero overlap which we were mentioning earlier. A bond is not formed even in zero zero. A bond is not formed even in negative. A bond is not formed even in zero. What happens in zero is that there is a lobe of an orbital here.Going into the next nodal plane it looks like
I had already told you that this can happen here too. A and PUnderstand like this, two similar people will come close. If they come close then it is constructive i.e. a bond will be formed. It is a good thing. The good thinker is the good thinker. The good thinker is coming close. The good thinker is the bad thinker. Plus minus. Good and bad are coming close. When comes close then there is no benefit to anyone. Negative over bond will not be formed. If you understand the point, then we are going to see all these things in overlapping. We are going to see the questions of overlapping too. Now you can do the questions of overlapping too, son. Bond angle.A lot of questions are asked on how to find the bond angle. There are a lot of questions on the bond angle, so the trick to find the bond angle is some ways to find the bond angle. First of all, you have to see the VSC PR, that is, you will get to know a lot from the shape. First of all, what you have to do is to see the shape. From that shape, you will get to know a lot about the angle, like the one which is linear is the maximum angle, max theta is 180 degrees between the angles of two bonds.Bond Angle: First of all, what is the bond angle? What is the angle between bond pairs? What is it called? Bond angle. What is the angle between bond pairs called? Son, bond angle is linear, it is maximum. If we do not get the answer from it, then if the hybridization equation becomes the same, then we have to follow the same steps. I will get all the examples done. I am just learning right now, I will get all the examples done ifHybridized Ie should become same. Whatever species we are comparing, if hybridized to hybridized is the same, then what will be the angle same theta also same but if the lone pair is present on the central atom, if the lone pair is present on the central atom, where is the lone pair present on the central atom, then if the lone pair increases on the central atom, then the bond angle will decrease.Because we know what the lone pair on the central atom does, son, the bond pair represses the bond pair and you know that the lone pair does repulsion, so the more lone pairs there are, the more the bond angle, because we know that the lone pair is the lone pair max, after that the lone pair is the bond pair, after that the last one is the bond pair, if I am missing something then bond pair is bond pair.So this is the weakest link and that is, we are also finding out the angle in the middle of that i.e. if the lone pair comes then the ultimate repulsion is that who will get the maximum bond angle to the bond pair and because of that the angle which is there will decrease, so the way to remember is lone pair, apply theta, subtract the lone pair, apply theta, reduce the more as much as possible, now the next condition is dead, say die case friend, leave it, there is nothing, lone pair is also a number.K is the same and the hybridized emission is the same so the lone pairs were different. Here the number of lone pairs is also the same and hybridized. Now how will you answer? Then it is asked. It is seen that if the size of the surrounding atom is increasing then the angle increases why because surrounding atom means that if it will be larger in size then repulsion will increase. If its size will increase then what will be theta will also increase and vice versa.If the size of the central atom increases, then the bond angle will decrease. If I make it bigger, the fight between them will reduce. If I make it bigger, the fight between them will reduce. If the fight is less, then there will be no fight. Then the angle will not change. Repulsion increases the angle. Repulsion increases the angle. So as the size of the surrounding atom increases, the angle increases but if I increase the size of the central atom, the angle decreases because you make it bigger.If you give a lot of space or you will not fight, the point is that only when there will be questions, it will be fun, let's ask questions, let's eat a little, let's ask questions, if I have written here that co2 and so2, first question, apply your mind, when you do this, A2, A is zero, linear sir and A2 is ev, sir, now see brother, linear and bent, think for yourself, the angle of linear will be greater in linear and bent, nay, the angle of linear will be greater in linear and bent.No, take this, take this second, suppose I wrote so3 and so2, these are the small examples asked in NEET.
See, ab3 is a1 a0 and this is ab3 a ab2 a1. See, some children will even say this directly. They say, you can also think from triglin that its hybridized dilation is the same, but here the loan pair is zero and here there is one, loan pair is more and angle is less, so which case is this, how did this happen? See, this one that the loan pair is present, the hybridized atom does not have loan pair, then what.Will you do sicl4 and ccl4 sicl4 and ccl4 see this is also ab4 a0 this is also ab4 a0 this is also sp3 this is also sp3 Hybridized is the same so bond angle is also the same here is this case see if it is absent and no one has it then how to answer then according to hybridized let's fourth comment section is telling how serious people are about their studies.Do it, you see it is written no2 plus a2 minus no3 minus a2 minus n3 minus no2 ps nh3 nh4 ps ch4 nh3 ch4 nh3 h2o, think about it and I am also telling you that you have one or two minutes time, do it quickly. Yes brother, this is S, this is at, the angle of A will be higher, this is at and this is also at, but this is A3 L0 and this is A2 A1. A child is asking, Sir, you know how to teach.Didn't I say, brother, those people don't know how to teach, I don't know how to teach those people who have done nothing for the whole year, they have come here with a raised face and have done nothing for the whole year, they want selection on the basis of one and a half months, okay, yes, everything is possible in the film world, it is possible, but the world does not run on films, my brother, the real will be real, live in reality, don't make airs, first of all it is fine, otherwise it is our work, we will do it, we will teach you, but you are thinking that I will sit here in my lap and feed you.That hey, take it son, look at it like this, look at it like this, it is not possible, A3, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A2, A2, Now look, it does not have a loan pair, it has a loan pair, it is hybridized and the loan pair is different, so what will be the angle of the one which has more loan pairs, son, it will be less, who will work so hard, brother, it had to be selected by you first, tell me this, but no, there are some people in this also, there are such spammers, they are jealous of many people.They are not able to teach, they are coming here and writing, half of them are masters in this, yes n3 minus A2 A0 A2 A0, yes sir, if two are linear, then make them equal, then if both are linear, then make them equal, the bund angle will be equal, A3 and A3, A4 A0, hybrid same, yes, loan per different, reduce it, because loan pair is more, loan per is less, loan per is more, then what will be the angle, less A4 LJ, now it is known here.People are yearning that how is it extracting the types of molecules so quickly, so one day you also extract it, you cannot study chemical bonding with me by skipping VSC PR, then I am saying that the one who has skipped VSC PR, he has to take the drop till next year A3 A1, now look again it has become the same, look, now this time it will be reduced, this too ab4 A0, this too ab4, so it has reduced, it is here ab4 A0, it is hereab3 a1 here comes ab2 a2 look hybridized brother of all three let's do one more so4 2 mine and cl4 2 mine or po43 mine what will happen this is also ab4 a0 this is also ab4 a0 both are sp3 this is also sp3 make equal then end the matter a3 a3 a b3 what is everything the same everything is the same on moving from here to here the size of the central atom is increasing theta will decrease yellow12 NC A3 P S3 A S3 S B S3 What is happening when we go from here to here, sorry I have written it in reverse yes, it is the same thing here too, the size of the central atom is increasing, so reduce the theta which is there, why because the lone pair is equal, the lone pair in this is the lone pair in this, the lone pair in this is the hybridized same and the number of lone pair is the same, so weIt is in the last condition so it is ok brother nf3 NC A3 N B3 If the size of the surrounding atom is increasing on moving from here to here then what will be the increase in theta. If I write all these things like h2o h2s h2se h2te then the bond angle will be less in this also because everything is the same. The size of the central atom is increasing. Is it 14? Now it has become 13. What is the number 15? Listen, what is the number 15?Look at the number 15 brother, look at bf3 bcl3 bbr3 b3 Now what does the child do in a hurry in this, he forgets that none of them has a lone pair and is hybridized at the central atom, then do not look at hybridized in this, the size of the central atom, the surrounding atom, the surrounding atom is increasing, na na na na na, the size of the surrounding atom is definitely increasing, but if you look at this chart, if the lone pair is
If there is no R then all these things are not there. Yes, there is a lone pair, then there are all these things. Here, there is no lone pair. Now no one has a lone pair, so it is the same case as there was ccl4 and sicl4, the same case happened. Look at this one, bf3 Bb Aa3 B Aa3, this is the bond angle. Then it is a small topic, son, what are the uses of D in hybridized, this is a direct question.And you have to remember that there is one d in sp3d, that d is root square, there are two in it, so take this one and take the second axis, take the second axis, then out of three, two become y and one d is taken one more, so in total you remember like this d1 d2 d3, start from the first dz2 d j s d z sc is in all, then where there is two, both are the same and if there is three, there are two axes, now there is no axis left, so we dLet's take aqua, remember this direct question comes to you, you get hybridized statement like he has written sf6, what has he written son he has written sf6, now he is asking what is the use of d in it, so first of all you take out its a6 a0 hybrid, as soon as you take out a6 a0, it will become sp3 d2 and as soon as it becomes d2, you immediately catch it and say, j squa and d is a squa squa evolved from this.In hybrid it is fine, it is direct, meaning it will not ask in any other way or it will only ask you to tell which D has been used, there is nothing else. Let us see the orders of some important bond strengths which become questions. Sometimes, however, this is a data based thing, isn't it the order of or factors affecting bond strength? Write it like this. First of all, the bond strength is seen from the principal quantum number or from the size.It will be seen and the size will be calculated from the principal quantum number, from the shell number, like here there is a bond of 1s 1s, here there is a bond of 2s 2s and here there is a bond of 3s 3s, so the strength of this is its highest and why one is taken out because if we talk about the principal quantum number, then the value of n is one here, here is two, here is three, then the week made of 3s 3s will be 2s 2s.The one made of s will be stronger and the one made of s and s overlapping will be stronger but sir if the size is same then it will be seen if it is from directional nature then the strength of the bond will be directly proportional then from directional nature and who has directional nature, s has angular nature, son and p have directional nature, so more is the directional nature.The bond will be strong, the electron density will be in one direction, if I write 2s 2s, if I write 2s 2p and if I write 2p 2p, then tell me, can you answer from the size? No, size is the first factor which will be checked, but here size factor cannot be applied. Two two two two two two, all the principal quantum numbers are the same. Now what to do, it is made up of s and s. This s is the least directional in nature.And if a p is made of p, then directional nature will come and this is a sigma made of p and p, that is, this is the first thing that is asked for co-axle, that is, sigma bond formation, this is then if the size is same, then what happens in the case of pi, that is, here it is p. The bond strength is directly proportional to the extent of merging area and how will the merging area come out? Let's assume 3d pi 3d.Pi is Pi and 3d Pi is 3p Pi and 3p Pi is 3p Pi, so the order of these is that the Pi with D is the strongest, the Pi with D is weak and the Pi with P is the weakest, I will tell you the reason for that, if two straight ones meet like this, then they will have to come very close to merge, then they will merge because the lobe itself is straight, one lobe here, one lobe here is bent and the one lobed is straight.Now if one of the lobes is already bent then it will have to come less close, it will bring out more merging area, because because both these lobes are bent, it will be more easy to form pi bond, here both of them are bent, then most of the merging area will come out inside each other, when they join, then they will bring out more of the common area, both are such lobes, both are inclined, so the merging area will come out the most, there is repulsion on loan on loan, some exceptions are shown.Can clear only these second period elements and only these single bonded atoms. Valid for Nitrogen Oxygen Fluorine Ok.
Ta this is Nitrogen Oxygen Have to think about Fluorine Come, what is written first of all 1s 1s 2s 2s Just extracted it will be strong 2s 2s 2s 2p 2p 2p Will go by directional nature Size is same Tv 2 Size is same Beta Tv 2 Same size comparison This is not to be done This is not to be compared between these two This is a bond made of 1s 2sAnd this is a bond made of 1s 2p, this is 1s 2s type of overlapping and this is 1s 2p type of overlapping, so what will happen in this, it will have to be said to be stronger due to directional nature because in this pi has come. Look, the size is the same, one and two, one and two have become the same size. Pip ko axial means sigma peep ko lateral means pi. We have already read that sigma is stronger than pi. Look at this.Then came n a single bond a p p If we look at the size, it was supposed to be strong but it would be strong, then here if oxygen is sulfur, it was supposed to be strong but it would be strong, this is fluorine fluorine, this is fluorine fluorine, how would it be, it was supposed to be strong, but this week is back again, this week would be the final order, the final order that happens is something like this that cl2, then br2, then f2, and then i2 will come, son, this final order will come, it has reduced, okay, but by how much.It has reduced, it has reduced so much, it will come here okay brother and what do you feel in all these three? Lone pair, lone pair repulsion size is small and lone pair are present, then due to lone pair lone pair repulsion, the bund gets broken quickly. Look, how will you answer this? 2s 2s 2s 2 P 2 Pat P 3s 3s Look, first of all pick the size, because of the size this number has come andThis number five has come, this is the weakest, now it is here, the same size, the same size, the one with PP is stronger, two, then this three, then this four, how will it become this one, two, three, these are like this, first of all look at the size, the one which is different in size will be considered strong, this is already 3p 3p 3p 3d 3d 3d, so it means 3p 3p is the weakest 3p 3d, stronger than that and 3d 3d.Now the question that comes to the strongest is that if you compare it with 2 pieces, then give it a number because first of all the size is considered. Size is the biggest factor. If the size is small, then it is strong. Then this size becomes the same. If the size becomes the same, then again it comes to your number two, this at number three and this at number four. This is the same. It does not exist and this is the reason why P2 does not exist because the pi in P2 and the pi in 3 is pi 3.p must be pi and if it does not agitate then p2 will also not agitate but n2 agitates. At room temperature n triple bond n n does agitate n2 agitates. What is the reason? The pies in it will be 2p pi. 2p pi because nitrogen is from the second period. What does nitrogen have to form a bond? If there is 2p then it will agitate. n2 agitates but p2 does not agitate. Its region is p2.The pi bonding in p pi p pi bonding is very weak, so weak that it does not exist bond. Hybridized having odd electron can participate in hybridized surrounding atom is high A. Let me tell you a simple trick for you, right, if there is hydrogen then the orbital with odd electron is not to be counted, just like I wrote here C one d electron H H H C one d electron F A A Now here you count it.Here you will do three sigma plus one, how much will this box get together? Here you will get three sigma, but this one box is not to be counted. If this one box is not to be counted, then what will it be? It will not be sp3, it will be sp2. All you have to pay attention to in the electron is that there is hydrogen in the surrounding, so do not make that box participate in the hybrid. If you do not make it participate, then only three sigma are to be counted, but in this youThree sigma and count it considering it as a lone pair. We used to count the lone pair. There was a problem in d electron that brother, when to count and when not to do so. I am explaining what to do when in the hybrid of d electron. When there is hydrogen in the surrounding, then only that box which has odd electron is not to be counted. Here we did not count that box only, so only three sigma were counted. Similarly, if no is 2, then see if it is no2.Now there are only two sigmas in it, two sigmas plus one, we will take that box, how much will it become sp2, it will be sp2, it is bent shape, son, its nitrogen, which is there, is bent, A2 is hybridized, the second one is theta, which is the theta, which is less than 180.
But more than that, it will be 120 degree because and the theta is approximately what it is? It is 134 degree. The bond angle of no2 is 134 degree. What is the reason that here there is no lone pair completely? Son, it is not completely lone pair. If there was a lone pair, it would have been less than 120. But there is only one electron here, so the repulsion of the bond pair will be a little more. They will come to know that the brother with one electron is the one on top, let him not be so much suppressed by him.If we have a small Lone Pair, then it is a ghost with one eye, so what do we do if we do not fear it? We open up a little at the bottom, so it is there, but it will not be able to press as much as the Lone Pair does, right in this way we can extract Chi, the question is F, now if any small concept comes in between, then I will explain it in the questions itself, okay, I have done the things that are useful, Ch P Orbital Overlapping Wood Gives the Strongest Bund, the first thingZero Pi Zero Sigma Now tell me what will you do, look, it is being fitted in the zero lobe, it is being fitted at 90 degrees and that too is zero, I don't know, it is made differently, it does not happen like that, he is making a pi, which one will be the strongest, see, have you understood o The angle is maximum in, I have just told you that it is 134 degrees, this is 120 degrees, this less is 120 degrees and this is n2o.It is linear, just think about no2, yes, it has to be corrected, brother, after doing a2 plus [music] I have written it upside down, now look, fourth brother, eight would have been no2, okay, brother, you can make the final order of them, now an2 plus, okay, the maximum is done, after that say, who is coming after that, no3 minus 120 degrees, after that, a2 will come, and after that, a2 minus, he will sit in the middle because this brother.Sir, that single ghost of one eye will be fine, tell me what is saying Hydro hybridized, if you remember the name then enjoy, otherwise enjoy then Ch species has the maximum number of lone pair at the central atom, no central atom, take brother, take brother, do nothing, this ab3 a1 will come, one lone pair will come, this a4 a2 will come, two lone pair will come, this a4 elv will come, one lone pair will come, this a2 a3 will come oho three lone pairsThe answer is four, g, one of the following conversion evolve change in both hybrid and shape, ok, ch4 is sp3, when it becomes c2, a6, then c26 will become like this, h, a, a, a, a, so still it is sp3, nothing has changed, it should change, neither should it be hybridized, it should definitely be changed, but hybrid has not changed, it should change in both, it seems brother, its hub is sp2 and it is triangular planar.And its hybrid is sp3 and it is A4 A0 i.e. it is tetra, then our answer is this, its hybrid also changed and its shape also changed, it also changed from trigonal planar to tetrahedral and it also changed from sp2 to sp3, see, its hybrid will not change, this is also sp3, this is also sp3, the shape will change, it is bent, it is pyramidal, the shape will change, it will not form Pi hybridized, so both are tetra.Yes, this is yes, this is A5 L0 but this is A5 elv, so both of them cannot be isostructural, the answer is second, everything else is the same below, the triangular planar, these are all triangular planar, both of them are octa hedal, both of them are octa hedal, let's go brother, now more such questions, I will give the easy one, the difficult one, the one which you will not be able to do, okay, this is the homework, the difficult one, I will not give it, sorry, I have said the wrong thing, I am writing the homework that is easy, okay.Neither is all that homework and even if I write the homework, nor do you have to consider it as homework, it is just homework like this PCL F PCL F minus PCL 6 There is something wrong in this question, there will be no problem, it is correct, it will work, it will be done, find out the P shape, what is the bon dissociation, just told about f2, then told, it was cl2, then br2, then f2, and then aa2, so its strength is less, so its bund dissociation at number three.If there is energy, then it will be cl2. So the order of strength and energy will remain the same. You can do it, there is no problem, you can do it, you can do it, you can do whatever question you are leaving, you have got the smallest bond angle done, you can do it, which sp3 hybrid is not of A4, it is not of A4, above, which of the following can make six bonds, can not make boron, can not make six bonds, nor is it talking about making six bonds, bone.Will not be able to make a bone of the second period. Who can Kovalenko, it is not a big deal, see what is saying according to witch of the following overlapping result P type, this is not P, son, type it Pi, Pi type of Kovalenko can make Pi, see A and S, then Pi cannot be made, cut it in the same way, now if the root
If there is an internuclear axis, then pi zad pi zad will form sigma. These two left will make pi, then the answer will be this, then the second fourth, okay, so I will leave the question and go, you can do it, nothing special, all the same questions, feel free to leave it, if there was any new thing then I would definitely get it done. What is isostructural pair? What is all these things, what is the IIII bond angle in A3 minus, then it must be linear, because A2 is A3, soTheta will be linear, now it will be linear, theta will be only 180 degree, then the matter is over, it is okay, we can increase it further, meaning, if there is any big thing, then I will mark all the questions in it, you have to do the questions, I will mark them, ok, son, I will save it because the question is expected this time, you are being given more question practice because you are being given more question practice because beyond what has been taught, it is better to work hard on your own, it is better because at least 2010 20 questions, we make 50 of them, you do it, it is more beneficial for you, the same thing remains the same according to me, and this time, this is being done in the hope that you are getting a lot of homework, because what did the child do for the questions? We used to bring selected questions first, then used to watch a different series for questions, used to do something else, we added a lot of questions this time, but yes, if we are not able to get all the homework done, then we will see.We will get the work done and then we will leave you. So this time the homework part is a little more. You must know that in this download, there are a total of four parts. Yes, the third part has been completed. Yes, molecular orbital theory. We will start with what we have. It is an important topic. After that, we will come directly to the ionic bond. After that, we will come to the molecular orbital theory. Okay. After that, we will come to the ionic bond, then we will come to the Dpore moment and thenWe will come to H bonding, we will do only as much in H bonding as is given in NCRT because now there is no point in teaching extra at the end time, no son, mostly I am getting things done as per the NC given, so that if the question has to come from there, then if he gets stuck in any of these, then the child will hopefully do it okay, let's go to molecular orbital three, first thing, let's talk about something good for this, we will study for Homo Di Atomic Molecule and Molecule.Having write this directly and having total electron up to 20, this is our limitation brother, because this is what comes in NEET, so MO is a very terrible question, if we sit down to apply it for everyone, then it will not be possible for us, hence we will study only for homo di atomic and what will we do with the total electron, we will study only up to 20 electrons, okay brother, what happens according to this, listen in advance, according to MO, according to two.What does MO molecular orbital theory say? One to two atomic orbitals of same and almost same or nearly same energy combine together. New orbital of different energy is formed called molecular orbitals. What does a byte do? When atomic orbitals of same and almost same energy mix, new different orbitals are formed which we callIt is called molecular orbital, isn't it two atoms of different atoms, two atoms, two one, two atomic orbitals of same and near same energy, and when they combine, new ones are formed. Now look at it, understand it from this picture, you will understand. Look, or it will get a little more complicated in this picture, and let me explain in an easy way, one atomic orbital is here and the other atomic orbital is here, okay, this is the energy when oneIf the atomic orbital and the second atomic orbital are mixed, then two new orbitals will be formed. They will be called molecular orbitals. What will be its name? What will be its name also?Same energy, assuming its exact same, suppose four and four energies, we have taken two orbitals of four and four energies, if two orbitals of four and four energies are mixed, then see the difference, then the total will remain eight. Right, suppose this has become two and this has become six. This one which has gone to higher energy is called anti bonding anti bonding molecular orbital. What is this called anti bonding molecular orbital and this is called bonding molecular orbital.bondi
From the name of molecular orbital it is known that s will support bonding and remains at lower energy. Son, s resides at lower energy and this is at higher energy and it does not support bonding, that is, the electron going into it will not support bonding. The electron filling it will support bonding. So NCRT writes some points, we also write those points. S electron is present in atomic orbital orWrite it like this, write it in reverse: Electrons are present in molecular orbital similar to that Electrons are present in atomic orbital in atoms Like it is present in atoms Well, electrons are present in molecules Not in molecules Electrons are present in molecular orbital Similar to that electrons are present in atomic orbitals in atoms Like it is present in atomic orbitals in atomsThe electron which is present in the molecular orbital is present in the molecular orbital. What are the molecular orbitals? Write down the molecular orbital. Molecular orbital is influenced by two nuclei, two and more nuclei are present in these.If there are two atoms then we are reading two, although if it were there then it is also for more than two, but because we are studying only di atomic, we have written it clearly that we will talk about only two atoms, so for us, when we are making this picture, we are talking about only two atoms, if there is more than one, then that is why it can also be written as polycentric, it is called polycentric, it has more than one center, molecular orbital has more than one center, because it is molecular.Orbital is made of two nuclei, there is influence from two nuclei, so electron is present between two nuclei, so electron is present bit in molecular orbital are basically present between two nuclei, all these are the points of NCRT, if you have some problem in this, then no problem, you read NCRT, I don't have any problem, won't it, all the same points are written, electron filling in molecular OR.Bietal will be same as electron filling in atomic orbital, just like you fill electron in atomic orbital, same way electron filling will be done in it i.e. all the rules will be followed, Hunt's, Paul's etc., all these rules will be followed, whatever you know, whatever rules are followed, that the one with lower energy will come off bow first, whatever is there, Hunt's will also happen, Pauli will happen, everything will happen, n Pl rule will also happen.Whatever has happened, all the rules will be followed, like normal things, we fill electrons in the atomic orbital first and then we fill it in the lower energy one first, then in the same way, it will work, son, it is not a big deal, okay come, now let us write further, then let us see how the electronic confines will be made, so let's make it, come brother, write here, put a heading, first of all, the internuclear axis is equal, the internuclear axis is equal, okay, then I ask you a question.What will A and N s together make then say sigma, then I will say what will 2s and 2s together make, then you will say sigma, they will make internuclear axis, then I will ask you, well, what will you make of 2p root and 2p root, then say, they will make sigma because root is the axis, then I will ask, no, what will 2p x and 2p x make, then say, we will make pi, then I will ask, what will 2 pva pva make, thenPi will be formed, does anyone have any problem in this? No, no one has any problem in this, but remember we just said that if two atoms meet then two new orbitals will be formed, that is, only sigma will be formed or sigma star will also be formed, now this will be called B AO and this will be called A AO, in the same way this will also become sigma and sigma star will also be formed, in the same way here sigma star sigma will also be formed whose name will be sigma 2pz.You can write sigma 2pz and sima star 2pz. Now you have said that two will meet, two will be formed. Two will meet, two atomic orbitals have joined, two molecular orbitals have joined, molecular orbitals have been written like this: sigma 2s, sigma star 2s, sima 1s, sigma star is made up of 1s, 1s, 1s, so put 1s in front, see this, if pa, then in pa too, two will be formed, bonding.And antibonding is done at 2px and at 2px, this is antibonding, in the same way it will become
A pa 2py and this will become Sorry, I have put n in the middle and we put n wrong in the middle and let us put pa st 2py, get familiar with these names because I am telling you further, what is formed from what, come, if I mix 1s and 1s here, then here it will be formed sigma 1s bonding and its anti bonding sigma star 1s We said if two meet, then one bonding is formed, one anti bonding is formed.Here I will mix 2s 2s, then here it will be formed sigma star 2s anti bonding and this will be formed sigma 2s Then here I have taken three boxes 2px 2py 2pz 2px 2py 2pz Now even though we have separated them, but these three are together, not brother, one of them will be p, one will be p, one will be p, one will be root, one p will be one, one will be p, one p will be root, let's say so.So basically here, here, here, basically, what will we do, these three will be found here, there are also three, here also there are three, we will get six boxes, look, two boxes were found, two new ones were being made, two were being made, two new ones were being made, two are being found, so two new ones are being made, here we will get six, one doti cha pa 6 boxes, so there are six, son, Orbital is six, so six will be made, now becoming six means one box here, two boxes together, then two boxes here, then one box together.I have made this here, have I made it sigma 2pz, so its anti bonding has become sigma star 2pz, this will be yours called Pa 2px and Pa 2py which are at the same energy level, then this will be your Pi star 2px and Pi star 2py, this is also the same energy Pa. Now this is the pattern, this pattern continues for whom for us, for beyond n2, if I talk about electronic confines, if I talk about electronic.Confin, we have two patterns going on, first understand this, I am copying it here, same to same, son, because I am explaining it, but ultimately you have to remember the order, don't worry, even though I am explaining, but remember the order is the ultimate, don't worry, yes, now I am making a little change here, the change I am making is that I am taking two boxes down here and then taking one box up, pay attention to the change.Now I moved two boxes up and one box over here i.e. I moved up the sigma 2 p root and those two boxes over here I moved it over here i.e. I called it Pi 2p Another Pat Pava I said this and because there is a pattern in this because look here there are two boxes here there is a box here there are two boxes here there is a box this pattern will be called 21 21 What is the way to remember this pattern ADJ 21 21 right andFor whom up to n2 it will do it for whom it will do it for molecules up to n2 but look here this is one, this is two, this is two, this is one, if you take it out, it is 12 21, till here everything is the same and it continues beyond eight, so we have two types of patterns, son, what do we have, two types of patterns come in confine, if you see, two types of patterns come in electronic.Confin two goes two goes one so 2 and one becomes two 21 ok 2 21 up to eight and it goes beyond n2 sir why so because beyond eight is son it is normal it is said without sp mixing and it is normal but it happens with sp mixing and it is not normal but ho no ho what do we mean we will have to remember two types I will tell you for c2So this will work in everything from h2 to n2, o2 will work in f2, this will work only in two, this 12 21 and 21 21, let me write both the patterns in front of you, come, first let us write the pattern of 21 21, come, sigma 1s, there is no problem here, sigma star 1s, there is no problem, sigma 2s < स 2s, look from here, first two have to be brought, first two means pa 2pxFirst will come pa 2py Then will come first 2pz This is two first to be written Na two first two boxes first one box later two boxes first one box later now this will go back forward past will be 2px past will be 2py sigma will be 2pz If we talk about energy then the order of energy is going on this is increase this is equal this is increase this increase this is equal this is increase and if same to same copyIf I do it, till where it is the same, tell me how far it is the same, till where it is the same, see if I talk about it, it is two 21, isn't it, beyond n2, everything is the same, just look at what is the difference, what is the difference, look at that, the difference is that in this, sigma 2 is root one, because there is two after one, that is, sigma two root is first and pi is one.
Now this SP mixing is not in your syllabus, otherwise I am also not liking it. If teaching like this was in the syllabus then I would have definitely studied it. Just keep in mind that this SP mixing is not operative. SP mixing is not operative. And think, if SP mixing is not operative, if SP mixing is not operative, then the same issue is going on for everyone that this SP mixing is not operative.There is Amy mixing in it, that is why it became a different pattern. These two first one came later. It is normal to not have SP mixing. So, if you are asked a question, if there is no SP mixing in these too, then again the pattern will be same for everyone. If SP mixing is not operative then too is the pattern, the only pattern is clear. Now let me ask you, tell me by doing it, tell me what to ask, if I asked you.Tell me, fill the confines of T. What should I ask you? Electronic confines of T. o2, so o2 means beyond n2 12 21, this will work. This is what I have taken. o Ps o together, how many will we get? 16 electrons. We have to fill 16 electrons. Come, let's fill the first one. So two electrons will go. First, second, third, fourth. 5 6 sa 8 9 10 Now these boxes are like this, these two boxes are like this, so how.You will fill 11 12 13 14, it will happen like this, isn't it son, because all the rules follow the same as in the orbitals of atoms, that if there are two similar energy p, then first the single will be single, then pairing will happen, so it means that here we have these 10, then 11, these 12, these 13, then 14, then these 15, these 16 singles will be single. Look carefully here, look carefully here, these are the two unpaired electrons.Two unpaired electrons in pi star i.e. pi a ao what is the meaning of pi star son anti bonding of pi is anti bonding of pi then write pi star or pi a it is the same thing ts yt is para magnetic vi bt could not explain why o2 would be para magnetic according to vib the structure is like this tell me where is the unpaired electron see all the pairings are there in it vbt its parameterCould not explain the magnetic nature, but when oxygen was taken out of the magnetic field after liquefying it and got attracted near the magnetic field, people thought, oh man, VBT is not able to explain its paramagnetic nature, a new theory will have to be brought, then came the molecular orbital theory and because of the molecular orbital theory, the paramagnetic nature of o2 could be known. Paramagnetic nature of o2.Nature was known because of what, because of Molecular Orbital Theory, it is said that necessity is invention, necessity is the mother of invention, so it was necessity, people were not able to understand that, later on, a new theory was developed, not just for T, but it was implemented for everyone, they said, it has become a wonderful thing, by doing this, Josh, Josh, let's move ahead, tell me, will you do it for n2 then?Fill the confines of n2 n2 n2 n2. Here's how many 14 electrons are there in n2 and A2 n2. Fill in 14 electrons. One doti ch pa 6 sa aa 9 10 11 12 13 14 y. And whenever this is also done and listen carefully, the unoccupied molecular orbitals are called AO or AO, so they are unoccupied or MO unoccupied.Molecular orbitals in which electrons have not gone and these are called occupied molecular orbitals, these are not only for n2, they can be for everyone, o Occupied can be different for everyone, I have told these for n2, occupied molecular orbital and in this occupied molecular orbital also there is one which is the highest, there is one which is the highest, like this is the highest for this, it will be called h.Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital This will be called Homo Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital and the one that is just next to it, if both of them are at the same energy then both of them will be called Lumo Lowest Unoccupied because in unoccupied, these two have the lowest energy.Homo Lumo, look, let's talk about bond order. Come let's talk about bond order, because the question has to come from here. Bond order means the first thing, the number of bonds between atoms. When the bond and order increases, then the bond length will decrease. The bond strength will increase. It is a little okay to keep this in mind.
Brother, the bond order is like this, stability increases. If the bond order increases, then what is the stability? Does it increase? If the bond order becomes zero, then it is non-assisting. And the formula of the bond order is what is the total B MO electron minus total A MO electron. Divide by 1. Because if you want to find the bond order, then obviously you have to remove the bond pair and then divide.Buy two will do it right, give me a minute son, come on brother, just like you have to take out the bond order of n2 etc. but before taking out the bond order, let me make you feel, you will take out the bond order from the formula, the electrons of bonding, leave the anti bonding, let's make you feel AD J, if you get this feeling then understand that you will become unique, let me give you the feeling of AOT, if we have just taught you that AO is a good man orBMO if you are a good man then tell me one atom is A and B. There are two atoms, if there are two electrons in between then what do you consider to be the bond order. One and if there are four electrons in between then what is the bond order then say two, ok, two will be bonded. If there are three between them, then there are six electrons. If there are six electrons, then it means how much will the bond order be, it will become three. I am saying, brother, there is one in between. Om Phom, now say yes, say, there is such a bond order, say yes, there is a bond.Two 0.5 or half a bond? What son, half a bond. When two electrons make a difference of one bond, then four to two and three six to three will make a difference of half to one. Do you understand what I am trying to tell you, how much effect will one electron have on the bond? I said it will give half, how much effect will one electron have on the bond, will it give half? So my question is if one electron, if one electron increases in BMO, see BMO means Bonding Molecular Orbital Bond.Will it make or break sir? Then on decreasing, sir will break. Okay, then if I increase one electron in A AO, then sir will break because increasing antibonding is a loss, sir will break. If I decrease antibonding, it is a good thing sir, then it will increase. Keep watching. By increasing bonding, bond order increases by 0.5. Bond order increases by 0.5 low. If I decrease antibonding, the bond also decreases.Now decrease by one electron by 0.5. Don't put it in the reverse order. Son, it is increasing on increasing, decreasing on decreasing, then here comes one electron. If I increase in ABMO, now it is anti bonding, then the relation will also be anti. In anti bonding, if one electron is increased, then the bond order decreases by 0.5. It works in the opposite way, but here if it is decreased, it increases again. If you know this story, then you do not need to remember the bond order now.If there is, then let's do it now, create havoc, come on sir, create havoc, brother, create havoc, this is your total electron and the bond order will come here, okay, one, two, sorry, do it from zero, no, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, aa na 10 11 12 13 16 A, you have space left, brother, if there is no matter left, then take it brother, pick any pattern as you wish.I will take loo or tut wal as your 2 2. Well, it doesn't matter for both of them, the same will do, now you will enjoy it, you will taste it perfectly, sigma 1s, sigma star 1s, sigma 2s, sigma star, 2s piet pYou can also take 21, it doesn't matter, it will come here, it will come here, the only difference is what I am going to teach now and everything will remain the same, if the bond total electron in a molecule is zero, that means there is nothing, then obviously the bond order will be zero, then one day one electron came, then one day another electron came and it went into bonding, when one electron goes into bonding, the bond is half formed, then one day another electron came, saying brother, both of us.It is in bonding, he said, yes, he said, you have already made half the bond, I will give you the other half, let's make it one, okay, then one day the third electron came, but this one is Sandy, this is Sundi, Akshay Kumar from Housefull, you know, this is Sandy, this is Sundi, this is this Sandy and this one's Sundi is this, that is, only this brother will harm it, now here one electron has gone, which was a bond, it has been reduced by half, then brother.
Then the fourth electron in it again went into anti-bonding, it then cut it in half, then it became zero, then a new beginning took place. Five electrons, i.e. the fifth electron went into bonding, went into bonding, then a new beginning was made, then it made half the bond, then went into bonding, then it made a half bond, then one day the seventh electron came into anti-bonding, then it cut it in half, then the eighth electron came into anti-bonding, and then it destroyed the bond. Had you read it like this before?Or write three here and reduce it here also reduce it here also, it was read like this, after looking at it with a jerk of hair, now look at the next three here and the next six electrons and think, even if this one was here and these two there would be tutu and whether it is two, the next six electrons will be continuously filled in bonding. My brother, two in this, two in this, two in this, next six electrons will be continuously filled in bonding, will they be filled or not, tell me whether they will be continuously filled in bonding or not, then it means continuously half and half.Half and half bond, the bundle will increase until we reach here, reached two, then reached two, look here one said again, half here one said one then here one said one and a half then here one said two then here one said two and a half then sir one said three but now the next six again these are the sandi of these sirs sorry this is the sandi of these three sands and theirs are the sundi here are now again the next six electrons will continuously go into anti bonding brother and will continuously go into anti bonding then lessHe must have said one, cut it, friend, then say two, cut it again, friend, say it, cut it again, friend, say it, cut it again, brother, it said, make it half, say it, make it zero, change your Flex DP, how many times will it happen, you are the one who created all the accounts, so you are not a child, it is confirmed, okay Anvay, you are there, then someone else was coming in between, that is you, a child, so it is not you, it is confirmed, leave it, why are you going to spam me, I am poor master, go.Do your work somewhere else and someone else is getting too many views. What are you doing here by spamming? What are you doing here by spamming here? Here you are just getting your work done. Get out of here. Get out of here. A famous teacher is teaching somewhere. You will have fun by going there. You are getting lakhs of views. Go there, your respect will increase. Are you doing it for two and a half thousand? Nothing is happening. There are students from here who have studied with me.We are revising the same. Let's say that the following molecular orbitals are degenerated. Okay, let's ask a few questions. Come, degenerate means those two boxes which were together. Now these are the two boxes that were together in only two places. They were either BMO of Pi or A AO of Pi. These were the two BMOs of Pi, these are these BMOs, these are AO, these seven were not together, these were also not together, these were not together.Sigma is A Pi, this is what it was c The question of NCRT Exemplar is either both of the anti bonding Pi or both of the bonding Pi, these two were together, look, either these two or both of these, this is degenerated, degenerated means to be at the same energy level, then it is saying which of the following statement is correct, now we will move ahead and which of the following statement is correct in the formation of die oxygen from oxygen atoms.10 molecular orbitals will be formed, this is correct, look, here is oxygen, here is oxygen, how many molecular orbitals will be formed, one, two, three, 6 sa, 10, so 10 will be formed, 10 molecular orbitals will be formed, it is correct, now what is right and wrong in this, you are asking, look, first of all, let's copy it once and then go down there, you will have to go up and down again and again, it is better to come around the same and do it all the same.The molecular orbital in the oxygen will be completely filled. No, if all were filled then it would not be empty. Look, this is half filled and if it is completely empty, then it is not completely filled. The number of bonding molecular orbital will not be the same. Leave this oxygen. It cannot happen for anyone. The number of BMOs will be formed, the same number of ABMOs will be formed in each molecule. The more number of nodes, the more number of nodes, it is a fixed thing, why because one MIf one bonding is formed then its molecular anti bonding is formed at the same time. The number of field bonding orbital will be the same as the number of field anti bonding orbital. Is it true? Is it so? Look field bonding one two without star one two three four five five bonding are filled but its
So right now the next two electrons will go to this i.e. if you make t minus here then it will go to one of these two. Now can you see one of these two? How come these two are the same Pi Star to P x and Pi Star to PThis is a movie, right? This is the last photo of o2. Here's a photo of o2. If you fill one more, it will go here. Fill the other one too, go here. If you reduce one, it will be from here. If you reduce one, it will be from here. If you increase two and subtract two, then the picture will continue with these two, that is, a burst of two. So always remember this. Overall, when you remember o2, here you will easily reach o2 plus and o22 plus and here o2 minus and o2.You will reach to minus two easily, now there is no problem, keep this picture in your mind, you have to reach here, increase one, you have to reach here, increase one more, you have to reach here, subtract from here, subtract one more, you have to reach here, you must remember the burst of o2, do you understand my point, with such a talk, all of them will come together and listen and listen and listen, listen, its bond order is two, now in anti bonding, if one goes 1.5, the other goes 1.0, butThis will come out due to anti bonding, so it is anti bonding, if it comes out then it will increase then two and a half then more will come out then three f further ltu plus and ltu minus remember if bond order is same if bond order is same then species having more AB MO electron will be less stable then you see how many electrons are there in ltu minus ltu plus is unstable in ltu minus no this is wrong anyway A2 PsIs stable and at is unstable, both are stable, both are unstable, both are stable, but the order of both will be half. Okay, then you will have to take out the stability from it. Okay, you will have to take out the stability from that, so both are stable, you cannot write more stable and more stable, you can make it more stable and less stable here, then make this answer. Okay, then you will have to take out the stability from it, okay, try filling out three more electrons.Three six one less two five three and three six and one seven now sigma 1s sigma 2s sorry sigma 1s sigma star 1s and sigma 2s if three and three six and one five are filled then this is how we will fill one doti ch pa but if seven are to be filled then here will go one more sigma 1s sigma star 1s sigma 2s and sigma star 2s now one doti ch pa 6 sa now in thisABMO electron is more, it is L2 minus, it is L2 plus, so which one has more ABMO electron, son, it will be less stable, bond order will be same, half half t22 minus da magnetic, yes, all that will come, homework is asking about dia magnetic and shortest bond length, that is, see the highest bond order, but along with it, dia is also required, also see this, 2 pi and half sigma bonds are present in ok, this is also what, let's go brother.Two sigma and n2 pi, this is n2 plus, understand from this, let's explain this story too, explain it to one, for the rest you understand, Pat PaIt has nothing to do with see how many pies are being made from here, two pies, how much is being made from here, one sigma, two pi and one sigma together, the bond order is three, two pi and one sigma together, what is happening, the bond order is becoming three, now this brother is asking that the bond order should be two and a half, but the sigma should be half, now when will it be half sigma, when I remove one electron from it, if I remove one electron from here.Let it become n2 plus and what is wrong with pi in that at plus? Sir, there is 2 pi but only half sigma is left, then the bond order will be two and a half b, what will happen son e, it will become y two, one sigma, one pi, eight, two sigma, one pi, sorry, two pi, one sigma, tell me what will happen in t plus, tell me the calculation of 2 plus in t plus, o2 pis will go from anti bonding to one and that will also go from anti bonding to pi.So the bond order of pi will increase. Put your mind in what is the tame bond order for o2 also? Homework, you can do all this, this is a simple question which is useful, I am showing how many unpaired electrons are present in n2 ps and not para magnetic n2 p electrons in n2 plus.
So we have taken this root axis, the internuclear axis has become root, brother, okay, what has happened to the internuclear axis, now it has become the root, now these are connected, these are connected, how will they look, look like this, in the middle, they have become like this, look at this, and on the sides, they have become a little smaller, like this, minus minus, look, what is this called, sigma 2 p root, it looks like this, sigma two p root, this is how these two are joined, but ifThis will become AO, it is constructive, if it becomes AO, then how will MO be formed? Look, minus plus, put a minus once in the middle, plus minus, keep everything the same, put a minus in the middle, then you say no, I don't like minus in the middle, you then put a plus. As soon as you put a plus here, minus plus here, don't bother with anything there, change the pace, make it minus plus, it's the same thing, two.Same thing goes away or two different come closer, both are loss, both are the same thing, now again what will happen here, here the nodal plane will come in the middle, why a new one will come because they will push each other, it will be something like this, so why is this one not being made by me, this minus this plus this minus this plus, its name is sigma star to p root, it looks like this son, sigma star to p root, it looks like this, if we talk about P and P collet, then it is like thisIt will be formed here, it is already like this, it will work perpendicularly, this is already ready, what will it do, it will work perpendicularly, look, this is plus, this, plus, this, minus, this, minus, so this will be added, plus plus will be added, above this one, it is going to be continued, this is low plus plus and this is minus minus, this becomes its name, how will it look, it is also like Piet Pa X or Piet Pava, depending on whether you have added XX or added Wa Va, butIf you think of this in a destructive manner, think of it in a destructive manner, then see how it will be formed. In a destructive manner, if I make a minus here, then plus plus minus minus or if I put a plus in the middle, then there is nothing to do with this one, but if I change the face of this one, then here is a minus here, plus here, the final picture is being made according to this, see how it will be made, this nodal plane is already going on, Pi in thisBut here a new and will come and a new and will come and then they will push each other, this is plus, this is minus, this minus will come here and this plus will come here, this is like pi star to piMolecular orbital are symmetrical along the bond axis. Now what is this bond axis? This is the internuclear axis, which we also call the molecular axis. And while it is the point of NCRT, son, while the molecular orbital bonding is also anti bonding, R is unsymmetrical along, meaning, okay, keep it with that. Look, tell me how what we wrote is the internuclear axis.That is, we have assumed that this is coming on the inertial axis, in this way all these are inertial axes, this is the inertia axis, so cut it from the inertial axis, cut it like this, if you cut it like this, then the symmetry is the same from top to bottom, everyone has to be cut like this, cut it the same, symmetrical, all the sigmas will be symmetrical because it is on the internuclear axis, so when you cut it in half, only half will be left on the top and bottom, otherwise you will see all the sigmas like this.It will come that you will cut from the middle, it will be equal on both sides, cut it symmetrically, cut this also symmetrically in the middle, cut this also like this, everything will be equal, cutting symmetrically is like this, but because molecular axis means internuclear axis, cut the same axis on which these two are coming, look around the same axis, that is, you have to look above and below such a cut, now it comes to this that it is cut here only.Already see this is already cut but above plus below minus unsymmetrical look at this here already look at this around this this is ours visible in pi so we can see it look at this but here plus here minus here minus here plus this is unsymmetrical along the bund axis all these things I have talked about symmetry this is along the b axis talk about this son along the bund axisThen there are some conditions for maximum overlap or for effective overlapping, NCRT has written.
The first AOS should be near same and near same energy AO should have energy of should be near same should not be like 1s and you will mix 2s won't happen you will mix 2p with 1s won't happen same thing right no you will mix with 2s won't happen but you will mix 2s with 2s it will happen ok son 1s will mix with 2s it will happenSo, how did it happen? 1s will be mixed with 1s, it will be 2s.You will connect, symmetry should be same, same thing other wise, there will be zero overlap, these are some points written in NCERT, see what the question is saying, The linear combination of atomic orbital to form molecular orbital takes place only one, the combining atomic orbital is saying that the atomic orbital should be of same energy, it is good that it has the minimum overlap.No no, there should be maximum overlap, then we have same symmetry about molecular axis, this is also true, we have different symmetry, no, so what is the answer, brother, A and C are JE's question, but now you understand, let's say, this is psi A and psi B are the wave function of atomic orbital then sigma star represents sigma star i.e. ABMO, now how ABMO is formed, listen to that.So son, let me explain, suppose we have this, not Sai AI, whatever happens, it is formed in two ways, Sai A B, if I say BMO, then it becomes Sai A plus Sai B, constructive interference, but if we want to make this AI AO, Sai AI A AO, then it will become A minus B. Destructive, if it gets digested, then what do we have to make now? We have to make anti bonding only, so in the case of anti bonding, this is one and the other, look at this.He made me crazy by doing 2 B. He kept me crazy by doing 2 B. This will make BMO and this will make A BMO. The answer will be B. Add two waves C. Subtract two waves.Between electro positive and electronegative elements, electro positive elements are V, which are generally metals and what are they, generally they are non metals, for example, if it becomes cesium, if it becomes chlorine, then cesium is plus and if F is minus, then it becomes CSF, then it is an ionic compound. This is how they are formed. Okay, ionic compound, so what is an ionic bond, what is it? Listen, what is an ionic bond, son, electrostatic force ofAttraction between oppositely charged ions F E K q1 K2 Apna Aa Squa This is your ionic bond What is there in ionic compounds A plus is a minus So there are oppositely charged ions What will happen between them What will be the attraction force between them Okay brother, then it comes to the matter Ionic compounds are polar in nature Polar means if A is plus and B is minus then this isIf there is polarity then it is polar in nature. Secondly, ionic compounds are solid at room temperature. Their melting point is higher than the boiling point. Melting point and boiling point are higher than Kovalenko. After that, ionic compound does not show isomerism region. There is absence of directional bonds because the ionic bonds which are there are multi-multi directional and these are present.Aegist is in the form of compounds Aegist is in the form of ionic lattice Anvay is saying Missing Hitesh sir why are you crying I will call whoever survives will give it in recorded form later friend, after all, what can we do, courage should also be saved in a man, the reason for this is electrostatic force, the reason for this is electrostatic force, the reason for this is the region of both, this too is strong, electrostatic is the next one, ionic compounds do not conductWell in solid but it conducts in molten as well as in aqueous. If you are asked that why is AL solid which is solid as a salt is a bad conductor of electricity? Is there no ice in it? No, it is in solid. There is no mobility of ice. This is the same as ice, but the force in solid is stronger. So what happens son, those are ionic compounds, aren't ionic compounds ionic?ice in compounds
If we talk about mobility and conductance, there are ions inside the solid, there are ions inside the molten and also in the water, but mobility is not there in the solid, it happens in the molten, it happens in the water, hence conductance does not happen in the solid, it happens in the molten and water, then let's talk about ionic compound for the stable ionic compound for the formation of table.Ionic compound released energy must not be energy absorbed i.e. process of release means azo and absorb means endo. Such a thing should be there. Okay, so let us understand it. Let us take the formation of L as an example. Let us understand how A solid is formed. Let us know things from its formation enthalpy that when sodium is solid then it is first heated and converted into sodium gas. This is called sublimation energy.And this is your endo, then one electron is removed from it and it is called A plus gaseous. These two will be called Io emission energy and this will also be endo. So brother na0 is ready but the one which is cl2 will have to break the bond, bond dissociation energy will have to be added and half of it is converted into s because the energy you give to break it will release two chlorines. We mean by one, okay brother, so this is done for you, what is this?What happened to you, this also became endo, money was invested here too, then now that electron will be added here, then it will become Sme and it will be called electron affinity, this is the first place where energy is released i.e. azom process, now both of them will meet each other and what should happen when they come together is azo should be more than endo, now what is azo, brother, so lattice energy is azo, electron affinity is azo, it should be more, sublimation energy should be less.Ionization energy should be less and bond dissociation energy should also be less which is less and endo ones should be less, less means no number, inside the energy and here more and more energy should be released, this is like this, if it is necessary, if you want to make a stable ionic compound, then you will have to do it like this, see what is saying, Ana ionic compound A plus B minus is most like B to form, put the vein, see, the brain is saying when it would like to be formed, when ionization energy is aIf the key has high ionization energy, then why would it want to become a plus? The ionization energy of one should be low and the electron affinity should be high. That's the point. The sooner it becomes plus or the sooner it becomes minus, the better the ionic bond will be. Clear brother, you are understanding the point. Son, there are non-directional bonds. Now for ionic bond, there should be an ionic compound. Rubadium chloride, which is Rb, is plus and S is very negative.If there is a lot of energy difference, if there is a lot of electronegativity difference, then it is an ionic compound. If there are two like atoms, they will be same. And when they are not the same, then ionic bond can never be formed and ionic bond can never be formed. Kovalenko will become metallic. Also, the bond between metal and metal is the same. Their electronegativity is the same. For ionic, electronegativity difference should be more. It comes on lattice energy.Lattice energy means energy required to break one mole of ionic solid into its gaseous constituent ions i.e. m plus and x minus is solid, you heat it and break it into m plus gas andWhen one mole of solid is formed, the energy released is also called lattice energy. Look, here it is said that if one mole of solid is formed due to gas contamination, the energy that will be released is lattice energy. Now we are going in the opposite direction in that definition. It is said that the amount of energy that has to be given to break it into its gaseous constituent ion is lattice energy. The matter is the same whether you learn the method of formation or learn the method of breaking. The issue remains the same.Roughly speaking, the lattice energy is that the lattice is made like this plus minus plus minus minus plus minus plus p This is how the lattice is made, these are the charges in this lattice, these are the charges, if the charge on them will increase, the magnetia energy of the magnetia is directly proportional to the charge, inversely proportional to two Now what is this a, so the distance between them is
What will be the distance between them? Son, what will happen between them? Son, what will we see first? What will we see first? What will we see about the size? First what will we see about the size. Come ask questions. Come let me ask you some questions and then I will teach you the whole thing. Here is the correct order of lattice energy. Correct order of lattice energy. Correct order of lattice energy na1 -1 p 1 -1 magni. So the charge is the same. Multiply one by one and only one will come. Here too only one will come but its lattice energy will be less.Because r is more for chloride, I wrote es and na2o. Now see pv-1 pv-2. As soon as you saw that there is -2 * one here, then increased its lattice energy. After that I wrote edge here son and wrote na2o here. Plus two minus two here plv minus two. Increase it here. Write a3a and na3n here. This plv-3 is pv-3. The size of lithium is small, so increase it becauseMagne is the same 3 * 323 + 3 -2 mgo2 -2 3 * 2 6 2 * 2 4 This will be more, we can do it like this, we can take out orders of lattice energy like let's assume I have taken out here, I am fine, let's leave it, otherwise the next question will come, we will do it, remove it, look, here is the question, the same question has come, what to find out, then homework is there is higher energy in it, lattice energy, this plow, thisPlus2 Might, so in this it has become more, then it is more in L, A, BR and LIF, the charge is the same but the size of fluorine is smaller, so it has become more. mg3 et i.e. Plut-3 and Plv-1, so obviously it has become 3*26, so it has become more. Find it brother MGO L of MGO aa MGO I A no MGO mg3 A2, the answer will be four I ST had asked yes, someone is asking only about the order of lattice energy.It's not a problem. Let's save it. Let's get the last part. Where will we get the PDF of the lecture? Every year's mother is a fool. We all know, yet we keep asking the same questions. Let's sit and talk about Fajan's rule. What does Fajan's rule say? Development of ionic. Sorry, development of Kovalenko. Have to find out the character. Brother, what is ionic bundle? There is a cut and one is fine. Both have a nucleus. This is a cut.And what this anion does is that it not only pulls its own electron but it also starts pulling its own electron. It pulls its electron cloud together and merges it with its own electron cloud. Like this, now both of them start playing electron-electron with each other. Electron-electron sharing happens at this common place. So, when electron sharing happens at this common place, the electrons get reduced here, then here it becomes partially positive. Earlier in the ana ion, all the electrons were equally divided.There were equal number of ions everywhere. There was equal negative charge. Now partial positive has come here. Partial negative has come here. Because of this, distortion has come. In which distortion has come, because of this, distortion has come. Distortion and polarization in electronic cloud of ana ion. Due to merging of off. Due to merging of electronic clouds. Where do Kovalenko orbital merge? What are they in ionic bonds? Where do they not happen?What is this merging called polarization? So now we can write that when the ration increases, then the Kovalenko cloud when it increases, then the Kovalenko valent character. So overall Fajan said that if the cutting is smallIf the cutting is small, then its root will be more effective, then if there is a large anion ion, then it will have more polarizability and high charge on the cation and high charge on anion ion, these are some of the conditions given by him. Let us understand each condition that when the cutting will be small, first of all, understand that the more root effective it keeps, the more merging will happen. Secondly, it is going to take, it is going to pull the electron cloud and it is donating its electron cloud. Basically, so itsWhen will its tendency to donate be greater, when its electron cloud will be bigger, when its electron cloud will be bigger, then it will have more tendency to donate better, so it means that there is one thing, polarizing power, it is always seen for cutting, why because the pull is the same and who is getting polarized, if they say polarized then sir.
What is the ability to be polarized for? If it is for ion ice, then the polarizability increases or the polarizing power increases. In both the cases, the polarizability increases or the polarizing power increases. In both the cases, the polarization increases. If the polarization polarizing power increases, then the polarization will also increase and Kovalenko will also increase the polarization, that is, in this case also the Kovalenko valent character will increase.With increase in large entropy, root effective decreases. With decrease in root effective, polarizability will increase and ultimately Kovalenko valent character will increase. Then the whole thing is the same. High charge and anion ion will increase in negative, then root effective will decrease and with increase in minus, size increases. As you know, if the root effective decreases in anion, polarizability will increase and Kovalenko feels like light na blood is getting choked in my throat.It tastes like blood to me, what is Acra Z effective? Son, let it be, let me question Kovalenko F C L Bir I F minus seal minus bir minus and i minus Will the polarizability increase? Is there an order to polarizability? Why because the size is increasing? Because the size of the anion ion is increasing, so this will increase Kovalenko yes, the charge will increase. Look, plus2 plus 4, why will the charge increase? Plus ifEven if there is an increase, the polarizing power of Kovalenko's Polarizing power of S block is more than that of S block, then whenever the coverage of S block and D block is compared, then Kovalenko of D block is not the same, is it the same? It is almost repeated again, do this friend, everything is the same, so everything is going on from charge wa to A2 P2 P4 P4 charge.Look, this is the only problem you will face in this, Plow Plus Two Plus 4, what is there in the rest, all the SB is here, where is the metal, forms two chlorides, MCL2 and MC4, this Kovalenko, now Kovalenko valent character increases, neither Kovalenko organic solvent increases, order of polarizability, homework will come from Kovalenko Katay's side, answer is the correct order of lattice energy, homework, so anyway, I will mark it as per your own.Don't worry, we will see it later. Let's talk about Dapor moment. B, let's talk about Dapor moment. After this only one thing will be left. We will also look at H bonding. Dapor moment is what it measures. Overall polarity in the molecule is fine. Vector quantity is like suppose I have to assign Dapor moment between h and c. So its electronegativity is more, so I have to put the vector on this side where the partial.It is negative on this side, so on the side where there is electron more electron density, I will have to apply vector on that side. I want the direction of lone pair moment is always away from the molecule. Okay, if the lone pair comes somewhere then its direction will always go up. If there is any lone pair attached below, then it will come down. If there is any attached here, then it will go there. If any attached here, then it will go there. The lone pair will always be away from the molecule or away from.The central atom can be written both, it is denoted by M and if M is zero then it will be called a non-polar molecule and if M is not equal to 0 then it will be called a polar molecule. Okay, Bha Ty Pole Moment formula is not useful, although q is non-sterile and NCRT also writes it like this that M = q. In Aa also it is written the same thing, it is the same thing, okay and neither is its unit, D Ba D Ba equal to two.It is 3.3 in 10 to the power mine 30 Kalam and Meter Clear Y instead of D you can also write R, no big deal ok and that 'S' is written big. NCERT does not know the same thing, its formula is its own, so the work is done from here that for symmetrical structures, m is always zero. What is m for structure, it is always zero. Now what are these symmetric structures? Now the first thing is that vectors must be same.Means surrounding atoms must be same. If surrounding atom is same then there is sub symmetry from A2 L0 to A7 A0 i.e. = 0 i.e. non polar but the condition is surrounding atoms should be same. Sir, this has happened in those with lone pair and without lone pair. ab4 a0 sorry ab4 a2 ab2 a3 and ab5 a2 what are these, this is also equal to 0 i.e. this alsoThe non-polar surrounding atom should be the same. All the surrounding atoms should be the same. Look at this. Suppose I am telling an example. Tell me the example of the surrounding atom. One is ccl4 and one is H.
Ta is chcl3 Now this is also A4 A0 but the surrounding atom is different and this is A4 A0 and the surrounding atom is also the same so it will become zero but it is not equal to zero it means whenever it is zero and not equal to zero then increase its dipole moment sorry sorry sorry sorry dipole moment increase it dipole moment what will you do increase it wheneverIf this happens, then let's ask some questions like this, come ax3 andIt is also in the list and the surrounding atom is also the same, here its Dapore moment will be more, this is our ab4 A1 will come, it is not in the list, it will not be equal to 0, that is, it is a polar molecule, this is our ab4 A0, it is in the list, it will become row in polar and non-polar, the Dapore moment of polar is always to be more. Whenever you see such a condition that there is one zero and one non-zero, then do this whenever you have to.If you see zero zero then make it equal in between but if you ever see not equal to 0 and not equal to 0 then just do not make this mistake, do not do this thing, you can do this because the value of not equal to zero can be anything.This is correct, this is also correct but both are not equal to zero, both are polar polar, so you cannot put equal in between because the value of not equal to zero can be any kind, it can be different, so keep this thing in mind, then comes this one nh3 nf3, look at that thing, although this is the only question given in NCERT is very important, it is given in NCERT, what is it saying that n is loan.Pair h h h n Lone pair a f f Keep looking, if the electronegativity of hydrogen is less then the vectors will go towards nitrogen and that of the lone pair will go up, meaning all these mills are going in the same direction, then there is more fluorine here and there, so these three are coming down and this brother will definitely go up, okay, so overall, it is that thing, so look, this is also not equal to zero, this is also not equal to zero.Both are polar but still A3 will be more Region Region Listen Region What is Atomic Dapor and Bond Dapor Atomic Dapor meaning lone pair R is same R in same direction Take some examples based on q magnetia and h so its delta e is more so the order of their Dapor moment will be this if I remove ns3 and p3 then it will be more if I do h2o and nh3If I give it then it will be more but remember if you are going to compare between AA and h2o then it should have been like let's leave it, let it be, now we will take it forward, do one thing in data based only, do h2o and h2s and then it will be more, then this is some data based example, in that data based example, give this one number, this two number, give this three number and this four number, it does not seem like there is an order of electron affinity.Similar to order of electron affinity, you will remember from that, then one number, one number, two number, number three, number three, number four, number four, infact it becomes zero only, HF will be more in the whole world, but h2o will be more in NCERT, HF will be more in the whole world, it is not known in the books of the world, but they have more h2o, not HF. You have written according to NCERT in the brackets, Sir, you alwaysWhy are some people only in serious mood, keep it serious brother, studies have also become a joke, come tell me the correct relation brother, tell me who will be more in homework A3 nf3 Permanent Dapor means the same, there is nothing m is not equal to zero, find out what is no2 co2, no2 o3 for both, this will be yours, this one will be its double bundle o and this is your ozone, its lone pair will be here and thisIf this happens then it also has some vectors, this also your M is not equal to zero and this also M is not equal to zero, then the answer will be C, rest there is zero in this, there is zero in both of these, here there is zero in this, there is zero in that, so it is saying that we have to find not equal to zero in both of them, it is saying what is the region of A3 nf3 in A3 atomic
Dapor and Bund Dapor are opposite direction wrong in A3 Atomic Dipole are same direction Ver Judge nf3 Yes Answer is done Third Atomic Dapor Bund Dapor Region I have written it Let's go back Let's mark in the question Let's come A Bonding Hydrogen bonding Neither Hydrogen is linked with higher elements like AO N Molecule acquire polarity Will not read much which NCRTWe will study only what is given in the section because it is not possible to study all the things. There cannot be a class of 20 hours. Okay, where you have worked hard day and night and taught in the main section, that thing cannot come here, no matter what you do. Look at when hydrogen is linked with high n element. Suppose hydrogen is linked to myPositive and partial negative will come on this, another one next to it. Suppose such a complexation will be negative and partial positive. Again this hydrogen, it becomes so positive that it bonds with the negative side of the opposite side and this is called H bond. What is it called, son? H bond, there are some conditions, see what are some conditions. Lone pair is essential at partial.Negative site and A bonding is fine, here it must have at least one lone pair, so what will happen when such hydrogen joins with such an element, then the polarities in the molecule are minus plus and such molecules attract each other through A bond. There are such molecules like HF as an example, h bond in HF then HF is solid.The H bonding that takes place in is zigzag pattern. Beta pattern is zigzag like H F H F H F. Is this one not right because here there will be lone pe lone pe repulsion and then what is right is right this is F F H F H F H has made wrong AF H F. Look like this here the distance has increased. No lone per lone pe repulsion. Stable structure. So one HF, you see yourself, one HF is connecting with the other HF.This will be called intermolecular H bonding. What will it be called? Son, what is the name of intermolecular H bonding? Hey sir, what is this intermolecular H bonding? When two molecules are connected to each other by H bonding, show two molecules, look at this, two molecules are connected to each other, this one molecule, this other molecule, this one molecule, this other molecule, it is going on like this, isn't it, and here's what will come to you.Here one molecule is not made complete, what if it is joined in this way, then it will be called inter molecular H bonding, what is it called intermolecular, then if there is inter, then something different must be happening, yes intra also happens that when one molecule joins one molecule with another molecule, then this H bonding, then another molecule, then H bonding, then the third molecule. When H bonding is present in between the molecules in this way, then it is called inter.Molecular, here the chances of forming a ring are very less. Yes, but there is a good association in the molecule. One molecule is standing holding the hand of another molecule and when the association in the molecule is good, then the melting point and boiling point will be more. If there is a storm, then it will not fly away, that is, the temperature will have to be given more. If the molecule is less volatile and there is attraction in the molecule, then what will be the viscosity, son, it will be more, but if it is intra, then it will be of intra.It means that there is only one such molecule in which two sites are joined together by H bonding, that is, if this second molecule gets joined together, then this is done in the molecule, which means in a way, you have tied a thread, you have made a garland, definitely a ring has to be formed in the molecule itself, now when you tie your hands to one thing like this, then a ring will be formed, brother, but yes, the relationship between this molecule and this molecule has ended, isn't it so much of a relationship?No, first of all this is a molecule and look here, the molecules are standing holding each other, here the molecules are not connected to each other by A bonding, they are doing H bonding within themselves, so it means that the association between the molecules has become less, there was more in the molecule, now the association in the molecule has reduced, then the melting point boiling point will reduce.
They will be in nature and will fly away quickly. What do you say? Viscosity, whatever it is, must be very low. Viscosity, whatever it is, must be very low. Do you understand what I am saying? This is low bonding, then this is some application, this is not an important point, you have to learn from the application, this is how it is asked. Applications of H bonding will be asked like this, it will be asked like this, the reason for all these is H bonding, the reason for all is H bonding.That's the end of the matter, everyone's reason is H bonding, it's okay if petrol is not mixed in water then there will be no H bonding, somewhere all these are the things of H bonding, everyone has H bonding, right, petrol can't be expelled by water, why because there is no H bonding, here there will be no H bonding, here if H bonding happens, then read it, those were the type of questions which were asked many years ago, so even this does not come, it is given in NCERT.HF is given and a y ortho nitro phenol is more volatile than para nitro phenol ortho nitro phenol lo here is o and at the ortho position a double bond o coordinate bond y lo this will bond here done intra this is done what will be your ortho p nitro phenol son para nitro phenol what is that is h is a double bond o coordinate bond this h bonding will proceed like this from hereFrom here it will run inter, now it is intra so less association more volatile less melting point point whereas here inter is more association more association more volatile less melting point boiling point less volatile ok Dapor based force states of matter used to be a chapter in it but now it is not there. Well, let me give you some questions so I will leave you, sir, I will try to cover everything for the rest of today children but it is not possible son when the chapter is big andIf time is less then not all the things are covered but yes, 85 to 90 things are covered, still I would suggest that you look at the notes at least once for the main sections, you have tried your best but you have left out the small things which you could have left, so small things are small things, 90 things will be covered in your notes, cover all the useful things, after this you have to read NCERT, not the NCERT things.I have left it, got all that done, after this you have to do NCRT, okay brother, we will meet in the next chapter, probably on 26th, it will be morning or evening, I don't know, let's meet, thank you very much, thank you so much.
