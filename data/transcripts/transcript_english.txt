Hello everyone, welcome to the third part of this beautiful youtube4 language of college, that is, the third one shot, till now I have taught you a lot of basics, then our next video was very important, it was on decision making, that is, if el statement with ternary operator, today I am going to teach you, for while loops, do while do while does not have any work inside the loops, but I will also tell you how to get all these things done.I am going to give these details, you have never seen a better lecture of loops than this, I can take it in writing and I can say that this is a very good video for you because I have taught from very basic, I have personally seen many tutorials of loops and I have tried that the lecture I am going to present to you right now, there will be nothing missing in it, it is going to be very comprehensive, this lecture is fine, this lecture may be too long.And if it is going to be too extended, then I can also divide this lecture into two lectures. In the first lecture, we will do loops and a lot of its questions, a lot of normal questions based on operators, and then I will keep a separate lecture on pattern printing because there are a lot of problems in pattern printing, there are a lot of questions, so if it is going to be a very long lecture, then we will keep it in the next lecture or else in this lecture.Will put it inside right but comprehensive will not be missed so let's start my loops lecture today friend we are going to read loops in one short or maybe I will divide it in two videos if the questions of pattern printing become too many but you will get complete content ok so let's start C in one shot part 3 today we are going to do loops in one shot so first of all let's see friend what and y ok means loopsSo what is happening, friend, you can basically think that what is coming in your mind to understand the meaning of loops, you must have heard that loop means things that are repeated, okay, it should be done repeatedly, that is, I can say what is repetition, when repetition comes, in coding, R means doing a particular same task again and again. Suppose you have to print Hello World 100 times or 200 times, then you are not going to write it again and again, so what?We should work in such a way that the problem can be solved in a very short time, so we have created loops here, not us, but whoever has created the C language has used loops here. Right, just like we had studied elsewhere, similarly we are going to study loops here today. It is going to be a very special thing, it makes coding easy for you. Okay and it is very important to understand this. In today's lecture, it is used in rape case. Suppose friend, you have to print that you have to print it anytime you want.It happens that you just write hello world here, let's print F, you go inside and you write here hello world or hello pd, okay do this thing, if you have to print twice in two different lines, then you could do one thing that here you can hit back sla A so that it hits enter and then you can go back, friend print F and write the same thing here also friend hello p db, okay back sl n, similarly you can 10 times.If you write it, it will be printed 10 times. What should we do so that we can execute this code in a single line without using it multiple times? Okay, in coding we follow one thing, which we call dry dry principle. Now what is dry means, Do not repeat yourself. It is okay in every piece of code, whether you are working in a company later or doing anything.It is always tried that we should reduce it so that it does not get complicated. Okay, when you start doing a lot of work on a massive level in the computer, then no matter how good your computer is, you will always want to be able to do all the things efficiently. Okay, so we use this principle which is dry. Now let's come straight to the code and see what are these loops, because there are going to be a lot of questions, it is going to be a very big lecture.There is going to be a bigger lecture than L, so there can be two lectures, so let's do one thing, create a new folder, which we will name here.
I don't know why this is happening inside E. Ifs, we close E. E. Fels. We go to C programming here and create another folder. It is being created back in A. E.F.L.S. Come on friend, no problem, let's do one thing. We go to our desktop and here we create a folder with the name of New Folder Loops. Now go back inside VS Code and you will see that you will get a folder, very good. Inside it, create a new file which is the basis of Loops.D C is fine, a file has been created, now let's put it aside and start our coding, here we write # include, then we write atd a, then we write int main function here and here we write our one return zero, okay, suppose you had to print hello hello word, you all know that if you have to write twice or 10 times, then you can do this work. Now you will say, brother, let us do one more thing.You can say, you have to write hello world five times in different lines, you will say here brother, we copied it 1 doti 4 five five times, friend, if we run it, it will come out hello five times, okay but friend, of course, we are not going to copy and paste a thousand times to write it a thousand times, for that, off course, we have some shortcuts which are loops. Now first of all, friend, I am going to tell you here about the for loop.Before explaining about the loop and its syntax, I want to build a basic understanding in you that even if you do not know anything, then by looking at this thing you can understand that yes, how it will be working, then I will explain it once in a proper way, I will come once on pen and paper, here we will remove all these things, accept this thing is fine, look at one thing here, comment it out, we have explained to you in the comments, now you try to write your code here.But you write for, I will tell you little by little, now it is okay, for bracket and like this, now you will say, it looks a bit like if, I used to do this in if as well, okay, we had seen this thing in the last lecture, so this for is also somewhat similar to ours, here, let's make it a little bigger so that you can understand it better, so this for is also similar to ours and it came in pink only, so it is okay here, now inside this, I am here.I write the condition for and inside I write the code and what happens is that when the condition is true then the code inside will run, okay the computer will accept what you call it and then it will run it will accept that thing inside the for we write three things here, first of all you see, first of all I write and show int i = 1 i is equal to let's 5 i p plus and if I write this amazing thing of mine here which is print F.Okay, suppose I have written the statement here, now see the amazing thing, if I run, I don't know what will happen if I run, then look, hello pad has come five times, now you will say, maybe this was already written, but look back here, if I replace five with two, I run, then hello pad has come twice. Well, if I replace two with four, then if I run, then hello pad has come four times, so if you don't know anything, but this is clearly an amazing thing.What is it, friend, inside this whole code, if I write something else in this above thing which I don't know the meaning of, but if I write nine in place of this four, then it will come nine times. I know this as much as I can understand right now, it will come nine times, so you must be understanding what is happening, if I write something else instead of this nine, then the thing inside is going to run that many times, clearly one thing, we came to know from here that this thing inside is this thing.I will tell you about Lane Equal 9 later, but this number is defining a lot. If I write 100 here and then run, it will come 100 times. Look, this is too much. Look, I am scrolling right now. Look, it has come 100 times. Look at my right, this stone is rotating, it is printed 100 times, so it is quite an amazing thing that by changing one small thing, if we come back together.Let's do this by changing one small thing and the work is being completed and since I wrote this print F only once, there was no need to write it seven times, so this block is useful for us. It is useful for doing one thing multiple times. Okay, now in this
There are different parts, it might seem a bit strange code to you, like I write int i = 1 semicalculus, oh man, these things used to be like this, like I write int x = 5 semicalculus, so this is a normal statement in which we created a box, created a variable namedFriend, it is doing the same thing, then after the semi-calculation, something else is written i e le e 7, another semi-calculation is applied and then I have written i p plus here, so what is the meaning of this, before that, if I write i = i + 1 instead of i + p, its meaning is the same. Look, if I run it seven times, it is okay. If I write six instead of seven, it is printed six times, okay. 1 2 3 45 6 So once let me explain to you the meaning of this code in pen and paper so that you can understand internally what the for loop is doing and why because of this number, just this six. Instead of this, if I write something else instead of six, then it is printing that many times. Why is it happening like if I suppose I write i e < equal to here, then it will be printed zero times, that is, nothing will be printed at all. Look, if nothing is printed, then this is a lot of work.It's cool but how is it doing, let's remember once here, let's come here to our page and discuss this thing well, why is this happening, okay, let's take a screenshot of it, just talk about this loop, brother, what is happening, finally let's bring it here and now it's amazing to see, okay, let's talk about this code that we have written, for in e 1 i e lane equal to 0, okay I have less.Made equal to 0, hey man, let's write something good here, man, for a second, we delete it and come here in the code, I write five once, if we write five times, then look, it gets printed five times, okay, so I will explain the meaning, what is happening, okay, here we see the meaning with command shift four, okay, now let's look at this code once, where did it go, oh yes, here is the code, okay this.Let's look at the code once, what is there in it and understand the internal meaning that if I just change this small number and use it, it will be printed seven times. Let's see why this is happening. Here we have three things which we can call three conditions. We can call three things, I color them differently. First of all I have written int a iv, then man I have written a i len equ t 5 and then I have written a i e i +1 Let's understand the meaning of these three individually. Actually, you already know the meanings of all three things. Okay, you know that int i = 1 means that I have made a box of i in which I have put one value. You know that i is equal to 5, which means I used to use it in this statement. Okay, so this is a condition. One, you know this.What is this, making a box, initialization declaration and what is the meaning of i = i + 1? You also know that earlier you used to call it updation updation slash, you can also call it increment, it is called increment, however, the meaning of updation is that whenever I used to write int x = 1, then I used to write x = x+ 5, then five more were added inside x, I have discussed all these things easily in the first lecture.If you don't know, first go to the lecture and see i = i+ 1. As soon as I did, what is the meaning of i = i + 1? i = the assisting value of Aa is 1 p 1. So our friend two value was put inside Aa, then one was removed from the box and here P2 was put, this is its meaning. Well, this is the meaning of it, but what is its meaning inside the loop, this thing happens inside the loop.It goes on again and again. Now let me tell you the whole process of why it is happening that Hello World is being printed five times. One, two, three, four, five. Why is Hello World being printed? So, first of all, what do we do? As soon as we entered inside the loop, we saw one thing. What did we see? This is looking quite a familiar thing. These I equal to 1. Its meaning is again. We made a box with the name A and put one in it. This is a normal thing.ok then what happens after this we call this thing
We call this inish jshan spelling, maybe right or wrong, whatever is written, it is called condition. This means that the value of i is one but it should be five or less, only then whatever is equal inside our loop will run, like whatever we write inside the if statement, it runs when the condition is true, then again this is the condition of the loop, as soon as this condition becomes false or ends.So our loop also ends. Now see how the loop continues. This is our increment condition, meaning what is happening after each round of the loop. Now let me explain to you what is a loop, what is the round of a loop. We come here, first of all we went here, what happens in coding, we go line by line, so we went here, we saw 4 ev, all this is done, then we went here, it is written here, print F, so we went to the output, okay, let's make a screen of the output.What happened, it got printed here, my friend, Hello Physics guy, and because we had a back slide, what happened to us, an enter was also put, now whatever next thing comes at any time, it will be printed here, okay, then what will you think, it has come here, it is over, no, the loop does not end, what is it, the computer came back here, then it looked, then printed again, then came back here, then looked, then printed again, but how long will this happen depends on the value of aa, like the value of aa.There was one, but as soon as this thing is printed, what happens to it? After that, this condition is seen. Pay attention, it is not that i = 1 is written, then this thing comes here by applying semicalculus, then it means directly change the value of i to two. No, it does not happen immediately. Once it is printed, as soon as it is run, what will happen is i = i + 1, that is, instead of one, i has now become the value of two. Then what will happen again, first of all, it will be seen when i is 2. Now this thing will be seen.Ignore the initialization, once it has been done, we came here, is my T5 or less than that, yes true, so if the condition is still true, then print the thing inside again, then here I am again, hello physics guy and because there is a back slide, then I hit enter. Okay, now what happened, as soon as this thing got printed, then we came back to our updation, friend, this work is done, so we update it, it has nothing to do with this, this one time starting.So let's see, okay, we updated it, so one more i = i + 1 2+ 1, so now here we have inserted the value of three. Okay, here we have inserted the value of three. Then what did we do? Next time when we come back here, is the three is less than five? Yes, of course, come back inside the loop. Whatever is written inside the loop, let's perform this code. The computer has seen it and printed it and returned it.Gave a back slash, now the computer went back to 'for', what do you say, as soon as this thing was printed, it was updated again? Okay, after updating, you must have understood that i = i + 1. Now you have understood that it has become 'four', then you saw again, is 'four' smaller than our 'five'? Is it true? Ok, print it here, so we wrote 'Hello P'. Then our value got updated and became 'F'. We saw whether our 'five' is smaller than 'five' or 'five'. Yes, if it is equal, then the condition is also satisfied.We have done it, Hello p. Dub was printed as soon as it became five, then it got updated again after removing the line. Now the value of aa became six. Now the value of aa became six. As soon as six became six, is mine five or smaller than five? Otherwise, our loop is over. Tata went bye, so that's all that was printed. One more enter was required, but it will appear that this is all our code has been printed. Now you must have understood a little bit about the working of this box.This runs only once, first of all, once we have created the box, its work is done next time, what always happens before going into the loop, first of all, what are our steps before going inside the loop, let me write the steps here. Okay, so the first thing is the condition that is checked. First of all, our condition is checked. If it is true, then it will move ahead. If it becomes false, then the loop is over. Okay, then what is the next thing we do? The condition is checked like it is done. Come inside the loop. Okay, come inside the loop.Come inside the loop, like this thing has only one statement written inside, we can also write multiple statements, do whatever is written inside, it said print F.
So it is done, now come inside the loop, do whatever, after this we see, we do whatever we do in the updation, friend, we are given a thing in the updation, like it is written here i = i + 1, so as soon as we did this, the thing got updated, the value of i is okay, then repeat again because there is a loop, so what are the steps, we have steps here friend that nut 3 back 1 2 3 then 1 23 This will keep happening like this until our condition fails, okay friend, this is off course, all these things can be changed but you must have understood the rough meaning of what happens to us in the for loop. Now let's solve this question first of all and then we will know a little more about it slowly. By doing this, our question was this, what is this, here is this code, again I showed you this, this, this one more thing to write i = i P 1.We have a shortcut, as I told you, i = Aa Pp Sorry, we have a shortcut here to write i Ps, what is that shortcut that if I write directly i Ps plus, then the meaning of both these things is the same, it is in short, so we prefer to write only i Ps, inside the for loop, it is very good to solve this question, print hello world n times take n as input from user. Well, what we have done till now is this.So, after seeing what all is going to last, now let's talk about n once. Like we come here, come to this hello page and instead of pad, we write world, ok here we have written five, so let's do one thing, n and will take n as input from the user. Here, brother, it is not so simple. Int n. Then we write scan F, but before that, let's make it a little beautiful. Print F here, write enter a number. You all know it by now.All these things are fine, then we write scan F and here we write percentage D because it is integer and here we will write end n. Okay, let's run it once and see that we have run it. Look, first of all it is asking for enter number, I have given the number, friend, instead of 'a', I am writing 'r'. Okay, so look at this, Hello World is printed three times. Do you understand, I will run it back. Now user control has come in this, we have 'rs' input, I write 'sen', so this isWhen the sen bar is printed then you will be understanding a little bit of all the things, yes, okay, okay here, one more thing, I want to tell you that I had written one thing here which is what we call updation here, it is not necessary that I write i + p instead of updation, like once, here we do pe na i + p, the same thing happens, look, I ran it, I wrote enter number 'f', it got printed five times, it is not necessary that I write i + p here.Now let me write an amazing thing, you think and tell what will be the output. Do a dry run on pen and paper yourself. Look here, it is the same thing, the same question, i.e. instead of i + p, if I had basically written i = i + 1, instead of this, if I write i = i +, okay and give a number here, 10, let's remove these two for once, let's make it a little simpler for you, then think a little and tell me how many times Hello World is printed.What is going to happen is a very simple thing, if I do i = a p 1 and I told you, this is a normal code, it will run 10 times, so whatever is inside will be printed 10 times, okay, I will put that on this also, now let's run it once, see, my hello word has been printed 10 times, it is ok, actually I had not set the value of n 10 times, my hello world friend has been printed here right here.If I do five, then five comes out, but I want to ask you, if I do i + 2, then what should be the answer according to you, don't tell me in the air, try using pen and paper for one turn, I hope you would have done, by pausing the video here, now I will tell you how many times it should come, first I guess, after that we are going to run, here according to me, 1 3 5 7 9 will be printed five times, hello world, let's try while10 is written here, look at it, 1 2 3 4 5, it has been printed five times, now why did this happen, let me explain to you, here we work once, this also for one turn, because right now we are beginners, there is a little bit inside the loops, if you guys are beginners, then just for one turn, just do this a little, we try to do a dry run with love.
Let's do this so that you can understand all the things. Come here, let's see this code. Friend, we have written this code here. Int i = 1, this, these, these, all are fine. Let's do a dry run again. First of all, we have this box which you say, I told you that it runs only once, so we have a box named i in which our one value has been inserted. We have given the condition that i should be less than 10 or 10.Less than 10 Lane equal to 10 means either 10 or less than 10 is fine and which is our last condition i = i + 2 Here it is different Let's talk about it, what three steps did I tell you, I hope you remember, first of all the box is made that is a different thing. If any thing comes inside the loop, then our step is this. Step number one is that first of all we are checking theCondition check condition, is my condition true, meaning we have seen that the value of aa is one, it is written here that aa should be less than 10, yes, go ahead, then we see what happens our friend step to step two, go inside the loop, go inside the loop and execute whatever is inside the loop, so here it is obvious that we have been given print, so it is written print hello world, so here we write hello world, if there is a base, then one.New enter will be done here, very good, then what happens is our step three. Step three is what is different in this case, that is updation. Now here friend, pay attention, what is the updation? Our updation is i = i + 2, so what is the current value of i. If it is one, then i = 1 + 2 means that the value of i has become three, so this time it has not become two, this time our value has become three. Do you understand clearly friend, so this is our difference.Now as the value of i becomes three, then as soon as it becomes three, the update is done, then we go back here. Check condition, is my three less than 10, it is true, go inside the loop, Hello World, then it is printed, ok, Hello World, now similarly, we went ahead, I am telling you slowly but understand that if you have understood more things, then skip this part, go ahead. As soon as we printed it here, then we wrote update update i = i +2 So i = current value of i is 3 So then 3+ 2 = 5 So this time i becomes 5 instead of going four Similarly then it will be sane Look first it became five Now date e value then check the condition again Is it smaller than 510 Of course it is smaller than 510 Go inside the loop and print Hello World quietly Then update the value again This time it will be sane Then check again againIf the condition is less than 710, yes then brother, print it, brother, print ours, give an enter as well, then as soon as you go inside the loop, update the value after that, instead of 7, 7+29, then go back to check the condition, is 9 smaller than 10, it is definitely there, Hello World, now see now the condition friend, that will happen, it will break, our fall will happen, Hello World, enter is also done, but now when we went inside the loop andWe had printed it, then when we went to update, now instead of 79, we got sorry, instead of 79, the value of i became 9+ 2 i.e. 11, so the value of i became 11, as soon as it became 11, we came back to step one. Check condition, is our 11 less than 10? Loop is over, question is over, so our Hello World is printed five times. Now what is your homework here that if I have written i = i instead of P2, yourHomework is this: If instead of i = i + 2, i = i = 4 or if we had done three, then tell me friend, how many times would that loop of ours have been printed, or you can also see by running the code, do not run it, look at this thing like predict the output, it is okay, let's move ahead, friend, you have also seen a little about the condition, you have also learned to make the initialization box, it is okay here, not one important, what is our point, very like you are one here.You must be understanding the thing, inside this code, I told you that it is printed five times, right? What was happening at the end of the box of I, there were 11 values inside it which were bigger than 10, so tell me one thing, if there is a loop outside the loop, come out of the loop again and now once I print the value of I, see, I can print A and not the value, let's see once, okay see this amazing thing, you say come.If the value was 11, then 11 should be printed here but it will not happen, look, I will run, an error will come, an error has come, it means use of undeclared identification.
Making a box, I have already made a box. Here we have a concept. Scope is okay, what is the concept? Here I write the scope of the variable. We will talk about it in the functions which will be our next lecture or the next lecture. I will talk about it in a little more detail after the loops, but let me tell you in brief right now. I will tell you the meaning of scope is that for or if inside the if statement, let's say I have used someI have written an if statement and inside it, I am creating a variable there. Inside the if block, the power of the variable or the limitation of the variable, the power of the variable, is limited within itself. Okay, like if we do anything inside this main function, then it is limited within it. It has no value outside here. Similarly, the value of our i is not outside this for loop, okay, but.We can do a work around for this, which is very important to tell here, if I create a box here, write i = 1, I create my box outside int aa, now what is the difference in this that I did both the things, it will give the same result, once we remove it, let's just talk about it, i, here I wrote int aa aa = 1, then hello world is going to be printed five times, my look here too, okay once again you are plus.Let's do this and write here f, so look, I have written a normal for loop here, so look, it is going to print here five times, hello world, this is a small one, look here, this is going to print our hello world only five times. Okay, if instead of aa, I write sis here, then this is going to print our hello world six times here. Right, if instead of this, see what is the difference, then if I remove this and write this, then also the same work will be done, but the same.The only difference is that as soon as I make this declaration, that is, if I create the box separately, then what will be the difference that I am creating outside and if now I want to print the value of i, then it will be that and 11 will come, see this, 11 Sorry, here I wrote six, I am so sorry, according to the code, the sen value of i will come here, because the first value of i was one, so this is printed, print f, okay, the value of i is one.Is one less than 6? Yes, then print it once. Increase the value of i plus pi by one. i becomes two. Okay, is two less than six? Yes, print F. By doing this, when we printed it six times, the last one got updated by one. The value of i became seven. Another plus became because it is the last step. Then we saw whether seven is less than 6. Otherwise, the loop ended. The value of i that came in the last place was seven, so we gotYou can check all the things similarly, if here I write 10 and i = i + 2, which was earlier giving error, now it will not give error, now it will give value 11, so actually its value has become 11. Okay, here I have explained to you a little about the scope, but we can avoid this thing. Let us move a little further. We are going to discuss this a little more thoroughly in the next lecture.Let's move towards the questions. There are going to be a lot of questions coming because in this lecture we have already seen how to print n times. Coming to the next question, we have also seen how the loop works. The various parameters. I don't know why I made this slide. From which parameter were the various parameters. Our first one was our initialization ini script. Let me tell you one more time, we say it like this, then the second parameter was our second parameter here.What is the condition and which is our third parameter, let's make it well. This is our increment. Increment can also be slush decrement. We will talk about this later in a while. Okay, let's move ahead and solve some questions. Here it is written, print numbers from 1 to 100. Well, we have seen that we can print Hello World. Now it is written here, print the counts from one to 100 and one more.Let's work, we write it in these different lines. Is it okay? Yes, different lines in different lines. What is meant by saying is that our output should look something like this. What kind of output should come? 1 2 3 4 up to 100, so we have to print something like this, then how to do this again, you should do this normally.
If you have to print, you will write print f1 2 3 100. You will not write it in a line. Here we will talk about loops, which is the variable inside the loop, the int aa that we were talking about, we can do a lot of things by using it. How can it work? Once we see it in the code, you will understand the code, then you will be able to solve the next question well yourself. This is where we come, let's create a new file inside the loops, let's write it here.One, then here we write 100 100 dot C, okay and if we write our code here, then first of all we will write shg include, big headache, friend, writing again and again, okay, tell me the truth, we have to print the count from one to 100, so let's quickly come for int a iv a len equal to a len e 100, then we write a pps, you might have understood some things and now it is amazing.See, the thing I am going to do is print F Percentage D and write here I will run this code, the count from 1 to 10 will be printed, now see how it will be, see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Actually this is what is written, see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19 See 20 21 toIt got printed up to 100 and of course if we want to make it a little more beautiful, then let's look a little here. If we give a space in front of the percentage D, it will come like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 up to 100. If we put a bar n here in front of the percentage D, then it gets printed in different lines. Okay, but why is this happening? Let's talk about it once. First of all, we will look at the space.Let's give it because we can see it completely, it will look better in the code. Okay, even though I had asked another question, here's why this is happening. Let's try dry running this code once. Then you will understand everything very well and after that, we will not do so much dry run. No, because now we have grown a bit in coding, I will show you the dry run because it wastes a lot of time and the lecture becomes very long. If you look here, in this code.First, what is happening, if I say print F and hello world instead of this, I write ok or hello inside, then you know how many times this hello will be printed from one to 100 and in jump of one key, this is also called jump, we call it increment, ok, first i was 2, if it went till 100 then this loop will run 100 times. Okay, we know that the loop will run 100 times, but what is written inside, look at it once.So what is happening in this code, I will be able to tell only from one to 2, 3 till 10 because 100 will be too much but you understand what happened here in this code, first of all a box is created, then inside I, I write here like this, okay, the first value which was there, I am writing like this, became our one, consider it as a box, for now, the first condition to be seen is whether and is less than 100, just go inside and print whom.Well, whatever the value of a, print it, okay brother, so here we go, here we saw the output, brother, we printed the value of a, we printed the value of i only, which was one, okay and also printed a space, this is a space, so we printed a space also, okay brother, it is very correct, I am writing the space like an underscore, but it is not an underscore, it is a space. Okay, now what happened back inside the loop, we went back inside the loop, but before that, as soon as I printed it.Value is updated i PPS So i = i + 1 So value of i becomes two Then check whether 200 is less than 100 Exactly go inside print f Aa but now value of a is two You understand this is a very clever use of our power So two is printed Similarly you must have understood friend As soon as two is printed Our value is updated 3 Is it smaller than 300 Yes go inside but printDo it okay, our 4 phase as we can see on the output screen, it has been printed up to 100, okay friend, this is not a very cool thing, I will tell you, friend, print up to 50, print up to 50, show me, friend, okay, print up to 50, you tell me, yes brother, from no to 50, now let's do the next question, think a little in this, next after this I will give homework, I will show it by doing this question.Print all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Hey friend, how to do this. There are two ways to do this. The first way is the code which prints all the numbers from 1 to 100, which is
Here's mine, okay, inside this code, we will discuss all the things even and odd in 100 to 100. This is the code from 1 to 100 which I have to print 100 times, then do one thing in it, put an if condition inside it. Of course we can put it inside for luck, which will just say what if my number is even then print it. Simple see how our code is going to be here, we will just use if, whatever our number is.In this case I is that number, we are printing I again and again, if A is divisible by two, that is, it is an even number, then only print that number, I is ok, then print F, percentage, D and A is ok, so let's see once. This code will run. We can also write it in one line. Remove this print F for one turn and put the condition. If I is divisible by eight, then only write this thing.It's fine here and now print it, see 2 4 6 8 10 God, all the even numbers are printed, the colors are also coming in different colors so that you don't get too confused, this thing is coming here nicely, now blue has come here in P F, it's fine, friend, like I had told you, if we write a statement, then these lines are of no use, we can remove them, very good and I had said one more thing, we can write this here too, okay, one space.Look, if there is only one statement, then write it next to it, then one more line of yours is saved, what have we done, we have put this thing, if I remove it and print it, then the numbers from one to 100 will be printed, but if I put this condition and print it again, then only that number will be printed which is even. Now why is this happening? Look, it is happening that inside this code, now I am showing you a dry run right here, I will not write, okay that whenI am going i = 1 1 What is smaller than 100, print it exactly but here it is, is that one even an even number, otherwise this thing will not happen, print loop is over, enter back inside the loop, but before that, the value of i became two, is my 200 smaller than 100, what is it divisible by two, print it at all, so the things which were our even odd numbers, did not pass the condition, meaning this one.They are not able to pass the condition so they are not being printed but they are definitely coming in the loop. The value of i is going to be from 1 2 3 4 to 100. It is being printed only when it is even. Pay attention to this. Now, what is your homework, I will not do this thing, I will print all the odd numbers from 1 to 100. There is no change in this, there is a small change in this, the code is written here.Modus 2 = to = 0. Just a small change has to be made in it, which you know, I am not going to tell. Look at the last lecture. If you don't understand, then go ahead. Print the table of 19. You have to print the table of 19, that is, up to 10, basically you have to print 19 38 57 up to how much is 190. You have to print it here, either you print it in different lines or do one thing, only 19 is written, then there is a space.38 space has come, space has come, you can print it even after doing this, you will understand that there is a table of 19, but how to do it, but friend, tell me one thing how to print the table of 19. Normally, if I come in this code, it is okay here, we write it in this code, more B, if we write something, then what will be the sense of it, okay, normal, friend, look here, you people can print the table of one, how can you print the same thing whichI had shown you that if I write till 10 only then what will be printed for us, from N to 10, see T 3 4 5 6 7 8 Na ok, here first Aa is being formed, T is being formed, T is being formed, if I tell you to print the table of T and show it, then I will show you amazing. How far does T's table go till our 20, 10 becomes 20, so I write here 2. Now see, I will do one thing, write 20 and here.Let me give i = i P 2 Now see the table of two will be printed, see the table of two is printed 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Okay, so what is happening in this code, I basically just changed my box, first started from two which was my end point, here the condition was imposed till the table of two runs and my increment here is how much is two.Every number which is next in the table is bigger than two. Okay, so that is done. Similarly, if I tell you the table of 19, then you must have understood. Here, if I write 19, I put a condition.
I am 190 and I write here i + 19, then what happens is that the table of 19 will be printed, 19 38 57 up to 190. Do you understand what I am saying? First 19 is the increment of 19. In the table of 19, + 19 keeps happening, isn't it 19 + 19 38 + 19 57 + 19, our 76, then 95, then dd.And what do you say 1771 then 90 okay that's the same thing with us so the same thing is happening I hope you are able to understand what I want to say here your homework will be print the table of n here print the table of n Here n is a e a integer jr e a should be f user will input meaning I will give an integer jr input here I will write int n and I will write meaning scan f here percentage d and n write one more thing that enterA, you can write whatever you want by numbering, like here I have written 19, now I do not want that suppose I have to print the table of 17, then I will just change it here and write it, let's go till 170 and here 17, so that I do not have to make these changes again and again, I just give anything in the value of n, my table gets printed accordingly, this is your homework, try it yourself, it is a very simple thing, it is not a big thing, II have explained a lot, let's move ahead here, let's come to the questions. Now we have come to a little bit of mathematics. Now we have come to a little bit of mathematics here. What are the questions? Display this AP 1 3 5 7 Na up to end terms are re re re re up to end terms. How do I print meaning 1 357 9 A. If we want to print our till the terms here, then here you should get a little one AP and if not.I am going to tell you in coding what I want to say, okay, let's talk about it a little bit here, tell me a little bit, what is our arithmetic, basically these are all the odd numbers, I had given you the code for writing odd numbers in the homework, but here it is written up to n terms, so what will be my last term, which I call the eighth term, okay, from here you should know a little bit of 10th maths.If you don't know then friend, go to the Physics Foundation channel, there they have taught Ariam Progression in 10th. It will be useful only to that extent, not much, right, so you should know how to find the formula of n term here. What happens is that in odd numbers, it is 2n - 1, so its eighth term will be our dot dot 2n - 1 and why does it happen, see this if you have any A.P.D.A.P.D.P.D.A.P.D.P.D P D 3D is the last term, my A is my A, this is my friend, your element is right, where A is our first term, right is the first term, like here the first term is our N and D is our friend, what is the common difference?Our term is a n - 1d. We can rival this very easily. What is our first term here? Suppose, if we did not know then what would be the first term.Our 2n - 1 is now formed, so this is the last term. Now, what is our 10th term? Well, we can directly calculate it from the formula here. If this is my 10th term, then I directly say, what will be the 10th term 2 * 10 - 1 i.e. 20 - 1 19 which we can also see 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 and see 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 So 10th turn our term is our 19 is coming, such a term will be 2n - 1 so simple if we have to write the question here which we create a new file of this, go inside the loops and create a new file A odd is okay dot C so here also we write all the things off course this time I am going to copy paste the things II will not write again and again, everything is ok, first of all we create an end box, then we write print f and here we write enter a number, then we write scanf and we take input of our number, which is our number, we write end n here, then we go ahead and how will we write our code here, now see what we need here, our initialization condition and increment, so we can see this series.
For h, our initialization int aa should be equal to itself because there is one, then what should be our condition that till when aa can go from maximum to maximum i.e. the last term which is being formed by us which is 2n my so aa should be less equal to two till it can go till 2n - 1 and here again i = i + 2 our condition will be i + p not i = i + 1It will not happen because there is a jump of two, if it was of three, then we would write three here. Okay, so i = i + 2, so let's run this code once and see that most probably this should work. So we write here 2n - 1. I am about to make a very grave mistake, I have already done it here. Okay, before running the code, friend, you must be getting an error, why is this 2n coming red, then see friend, 2n is not like this, we write 2n in maths.Look here, if in mathematics we write it on a separate page, here we write it. In mathematics, the meaning of 2n is 2 multiplied by n - 1. This is fine, but in computer, if I write 2n, then it is a different thing. It is a separate variable, but it cannot be a variable because the variable name does not start with a number, that is why red has appeared on the screen of our computer. It is fine, so in mathematics, if I have to write this thing, then I will write this only.By doing 2 in A then if I just put one in then everything is correct and the mass will follow then first this will happen then mine once and let's see directly or what did we write to print enter number I say I say till A we have to print d numbers so 10 then see 1 57 Now I say friend let's run it from back, first I am printing 50 d numbers lo brother 1 to 99 are printed okSo there is a different code, if I write here that I have to print first 100 code numbers, take brother, first 100, these numbers are printed, this one is ours, we are printed, let's move towards the next question, the next question is given display this AP 4 7 10 13 16 up to end terms up to end terms, so again a little bit here and our maths is going to be done which is going to happen in maths.Also, I will show you this question which you don't understand for some reason or a, still I will tell you how to do it, here I can see my AP is 4 7 10 13 16 ok so off course you can see the difference is of t, so here I will see the first term a is f, my common difference is our r so a term we can take out from this formula by doing a p n-1 d.Meaning first second third 10th 100th then how much will our a of n become? From here a is our 4, 4 p n - 1 3, so in a generalized way our thing is coming here whose value is 4 p 3n - 3 so 3n + 1. Okay, so this is the eighth term, that is, this is our last term that is going to be the condition and our increment is the difference from three.My term is increasing, it's simple, friend, what can I write in my for loop, friend, you must have understood the condition of my for loop, first of all, it is starting from four, a = 4, so this is our initial equation, then 4, then I will write aa, lesson is equal to two, what is written here, not lesson is equal to this condition, 3n my then 3n of course 3 * n -1 andThe condition will be i = a p 3 because there is a difference of th and then friend, I will write my code here, whatever my code is, basically this is A, I have to print A, why do I have to print A, I have to print the value of my K, so here I simply write, what to do is print my K, F print A, percentage D, also give a space and print A, so if you run this exact code, this is our A will be printed in this.Let's try this, inside this AP here we have to keep it till n, okay up to the end terms which we will input from the user, so see if I write Ta = 4, here I write 3n + 1, I had written minus here, I am so sorry ID P comes 3 P then come back here Aa = Aa P 3 enter number 10 then see 4 7 10 10 such terms are printed if IWrite enter number here again 50 then 50 such terms are printed see this whole thing is printed upto 50 so that's enough friend our good thing but here is just one problem what is happening with us that I have to apply mathematical formula look one thing is clearly visible what is our first term and another thing is also visible that what is our difference anyone can find this but
This is the maths that we used here. This is the extra maths that we used. Extra maths is okay, basically we had to make a formula, then we had to find out the term which is our condition till now and in this previous question too, this is the condition which is 2n - 1, okay 2n - 1. We had to make this, can the work be done even without this, absolutely possible, absolutely possible, we will pay a lot of attention here and other methods.We are going to solve this, we will create a new file here, listen very carefully, friend, inside the loops, we will create a new file in which we will write the profit A without maths or means a pattern or sequence without maths, see, we are going to do this here dot C, let's go ahead and start solving this question of ours, okay without using math, so again first of all we will do some things.Let's copy and paste it and see if we can create a difference. Control C, let's make it a little lower here. Let's go inside A without maths and control B. So what should we change in the same to the same code in which we have a little problem with this formula. Our maths is not strong enough to apply this formula and later the GP is going to come, so it can be a bigger problem but we definitely know this. Look at this.Where is the number of things starting from and is it going to be ours? Okay, let's talk about that or how can we solve this? Tell me one thing, if I have written A here, it means 100%, this is how many times the loop will run, this many times the loop will run, okay, look at our loop 3n, pay attention here, 3n pv times, our loop is not running if we are printing this A. 4 7 10 13 Okay, if we are printing this A here.We are printing 4 7 10 13 up to 151, whatever number of terms we are printing, it does not mean that it is running so many times, our loop is running n times, that is why we wrote that print up to the end terms, so we know that our loop will run so many times, so let us do one thing, we make the loop n normally int i = 1 i ele i n and i p p or i = i + 1Its meaning is clearly that whatever is inside the loop will be printed from i1 to n, it will be printed n times. It is okay. If I run it normally then my normal thing is going to run. Enter number, I write 10, then printing will happen from one to 10. Okay, I write 100 till 100 because this loop itself is running 100 times. Let's do one thing. Let's modify the thing inside us like this.The truth is that this thing of ours gets printed, do we have to print this app 4 7 10 13 16 19 pattern like this, how much do we have to print up to a number of terms, a number of number of terms, like 10 numbers till 10, 10 times, we have to print this thing, don't think of only 10 first, let's look at n first, so what do we do so that without changing this thing, we were playing with it for now inside the for loop.Without playing with the condition of this, just say, okay, this time it will work, what should we change inside, so here we are going to use off extra variable, take care of whose one I write here, what we are, we are going to use extra variable, they are able to ok, we are going to use extra variable here, how will we use extra variable, now instead of printing, we have created a new variable of ours.Is int a ok or any name i is equal to 4 with which we are starting now like a we are starting from four so we will do one thing we will store it in a new variable inside four variable its ok and then we will keep printing a again and again ok not i we will print a again and again now see if I write this statement normally then what should be printed according to you suppose I printed it here asked enter number 10 then II will say, 'A' is going to be printed 10 times or 'four' 10 times, look, it's a simple thing, the loop is running 10 times, now 'A' has nothing to do with it, otherwise the thing inside is running 10 times, just I know this and 'A' is written inside, why don't we do one thing, every time the value of 'A' becomes 7, 'A' becomes 10, meaning look here, inside the for loop, we can write multiple lines like 'Y', this is something right.Multiple life cycles can be written inside the loop, so why don't we write a = A P 3 Now let's see what will happen Enter number 10 Hey Re Re Re 4 10 13 bah
Very good, look, the same has not come, enter number 12 4 7 13, all this, all this, what happened here, you did not need to do that maths that 3n + 1 n term, there was no need to do all this without mathematics, with the use of extra variable, we were able to do this work very smartly because what we did was that first of all we printed four, then what we did every time because the difference of three is coming then the next number.Seven will be formed on its own. Look, first it was 4, then 4+3 became 7. Sen got printed, then 7+3. When is this and this ending? You will say that it is ending till 37, but 37 has nothing to do with this. Yes, there is no need. We just know that we will run this 10 times. We are running this loop on the basis of that variable. Similarly, if we also get 1 3 5 7 9.If you want to print it then see this, if we want to print such AP instead of this AP, 1 3 5 7 9, then it is simple, declare it with one and write our common difference two here, brother, enter number 10 13579 up 90, very good, okay, let's put the same AP once again, that was a bit cooler AP, okay, I was also understanding that AP is internal number 10.Very good, so you can print any series like this, give a homework, friend, where is the homework, well, the homework was this, by the way, let's display this A, I have shown you this thing, now you can print any other A here, okay, but before that, we will come to GP, now I have shown you without maths, because many children may love geometric progression for some region, some of you may not know it.Look, many friends, those who are B.Tech people should not know it, come after studying, okay, you are BCA people and if you had taken commerce, okay, you had taken it without maths, then you must not have studied this thing in 11th, which we call geometric progression, geometric progression is very basic, friend, your mental ability is the same thing as the one who appeared in the Olympiad in class 7th and 8th, that is, if I am in front of you.I write 2 4, then you pay attention, what am I going to do, I write here 8, I writeIt is 32. Okay, so you used to do all these things in mental ability. Now suppose you got a question, print it to whom, here I have also written 1 2 4 8 16, again multiplying by two is happening first * 2, then here also * 2 is happening, here * 2 is happening, here pe is becoming 2 and so on in is 2, we have to print up to n terms n means user.Maybe I have to print 20 such terms in the same pattern in the same manner, so again it is very simple, how friend, how will you do it, there are two ways to do it. One thing we can do is that we can find out the same mathematical condition of ours. Can we find the jeep's term in mathematics? We will find a term which is a * r n - 1. Again friend, this is a formula, r is the common ratio whichThat here is two is being multiplied by two, then you will say that the first term is the common ratio of our two and n - 1, so the power of 2 is n - 1, what is this my friend, this is going to be my eighth term but we will have to take it out, so this is a big problem, how will we write it in the condition, we have not studied all these things, okay, so again here my friend, the basic which we learned in coding.That thing can be useful, how can you write it like this, you can declare a variable, friend int a again started with one, then you will put the for loop, do the for loop only with i, keep its variable separate and I am saying n terms, then write this, okay it will run till n plus plus normally it means just n times the loop is running, this statement means whatever thing is inside will run n times but we will run the thing inside.How do we modify it, first of all, we print it, we have to print it, we have to print a, percentage d, I write it here, I don't say aa, sorry, we have to print a, just what do we have to change in a, like I did in the previous a, a = a + 3, which is our common difference here.
Simply write a = a * 2 meaning whatever the number is, what will be the new number, the old number, like earlier I had one, so 1 * 2 became 2, now a, then what will be the next a, 2 * 2 4, then the next a will be 4 * 2 8, by doing like this, you can also do this thing, let's see its results once, then we will see the results, then quite magical results will come and we will check the code by copying and pasting it, there is no need to write it again and again, we will write it here.GP D C is okay and let's do one thing here, no friend, let's do one thing, no friend, let's print this work, no friend, okay, let's write here this and what we have to print, let's take a look, we have to print this GP T 4 8 16 32 and so no okay, you have to print all this thing, it's very good, so simple again aa, you have started it from one, what do you write till here that it is going to a only.And aa plus ps is happening ok but which one will you print, you make a a variable int a which will be your first term which is one in this case and then you change a again and again, every time a is being multiplied by two, ours is very good, let's print it once and let's see it is working, ours will be exactly like that, enter number 10, take brother 1 2 4 up to the power of two, whatever is nine.Our 512 is printed, okay, so this is a better method, you can always use extra variables, nothing is going on, only one extra box is being used, memory is okay, let's go ahead, let's give a homework, friend, this is your homework, display this GP up to the end terms, the same end terms have to be done, but this time our GP is 3 12 48, so you have to copy paste this code which I just told you the code.Just here I had written a = 1 and inside the loop I had done a = a * 2. In the previous question, you just change something in this. Think for yourself because it is homework. Let's move ahead. Question display this is A 10097 94 up to all terms which are positive. Good question. Comparative meaning here, a little maths may be required. You will show it without maths. We will show you with maths also. Now aWhat happens friend, as I write 100 9794, can you tell the next term? Yes, it is clearly visible friend -3 97 97 - 3 94 - If you do 3, then the next number will come to me. If you do 91 91 - 3, you will get the offcourse 88. Okay, so it will continue like this, but how many such terms do I have to print, I have to print all those terms, up to all terms, up to the end terms.It is not written which is positive, which is mine, what is positive, okay, so how will we do that, how will we print the positive terms, so very much friend, here we can do something very simple, let's do one thing, in this, here I am going to teach you about multiple conditions, but before that, we can do one thing, we can create a new file so that you can understand, let's create a file with the name decreasing decreasing AP, decreasing.Let's call this decreasing A. Okay, here also we copy paste some code, we have given n, let's do one thing. First of all, let's print till the A terms and see. Okay, if I do i = a p p loop because every time I know what I want my loop A to run only once and I will modify the things inside in some different way, suppose here is A and what do we have to print, we have this one A 100 97 94 endSo on up to okay so do one thing make a variable int a equal to whatever my number is 100 and print a here and every time my a is getting smaller than three so a = a -3 make it smaller than three let's print it once and see here it will ask enter a number I say 10 so see 100 97 94 91 82 up to 73 but still I have to tell this.That I have to print further as long as my numbers are positive then in that case what do I do with this n in that case what do I do with this n what does it have to do with it the question here is do you know what is the problem here is we almost understood how to print like we have done this thing here the problem problem is coming here that I don't know what is the number of terms I don't know what is the number of terms if I can figure out thatWhat is the value of n? As long as I run this form, there is no question left. Well, if you know mathematics, then we have read this thing, can you simply understand it?
You can find the term, we make this eighth term positive, so 3n comes here, take 100, so n, I am applying a little maths, but apart from that, I will teach you a work around, 100 / 3, that is, n < 33.3, so the maximum value of n can be 33, meaning like there will be 33 such terms which will be positive, once we check and see in the computer, if I runOkay, once I run again, enter a number written here, I write 33, then look, 100 97 94 and so on up to 4. Okay, but if I do 32 instead of 33 here, okay look, enter a number, I put here 30 4, then I run, then all these things came to 100 97 94 91 up to 1, and if I instead of n,If I print 35, I got one - 2. So, I understood that the value of n here means how many times I print the loop till it comes positive, then I got that number here. 34 Okay, here I might have made a small mistake. Probably yes, look at this, I have made a very small mistake. 103 - 3n was there, then see why my answer came wrong. Leave it.Sometimes I am a teacher of maths whereas I am ok, no problem, here my next step will be 3n e < 103 100 otherwise n e < 103 / Ba 3 then 103 div Ba 3, how much is it? Our 102 is exactly divisible by 3 by 4 so this is our 34.3 333 so basically n is lesson 34.3 soThe n that can be maximum will be my 34. If I talk about it, you understand my point, 34 is that number, but man, I am not enjoying maths here, man, I am not enjoying it, brother, I don't even know maths, which you have shown here by using a strange formula. I am not able to understand and what to do with coding from the beginning lecture, then what to do, here I am going to teach you that forInside the loop, we can put a restriction, pay attention to this thing here, like I was entering any number in place of n, it was getting printed accordingly, but let's do one thing, first of all, let's remove this n because what we have to do is that we don't need these three things, remove it, we just have to print this number, like if I write 34 here, I have to recognize it as 34. Okay, sometimes the Visual Studio code is a little bit tricky.I don't know, I will run it again and show that it is very normal. Our coder should be run here. I ran it till 34, then look, all my positive terms got printed. What was the problem here? Friend, I did not want to print it till 34, so what kind of work can I do here, so let me tell you something amazing. I can write some more conditions as well. See what it means. If I write i e <= instead of 34, it is okay to pay attention.What to pay great attention to, pay great attention to, a greater day, 0, okay, instead of lesson 34, I will write lane e a gr 0, then I run it, run, same answer has come, you will say, cheating is happening, nothing, no cheating is happening, now look in this code, what have I done in this code, you will say, what a miracle you have done, here you have written the things of a, here also you have written the things of increment, but the condition is not there, so what?This can definitely happen, we can also impose multiple conditions, we can also impose conditions on other variables, see essentially, let me dry run this once and show it to you, this is very amazing, I have written something here so that you will not need to use maths, so that you can know what you say here, you were using this A, right, amazing, look at this code, friend, I have written a very terrible code, I have written a very terrible code on this, we have to print this A.1007 94 91 88 And Son Okay, so I have taken A as 100, so a box has been created, A has become a box in which I have written 100. Okay, pay attention here, this is our initial iteration, so another box has been created named I, which has one value. This is our condition. It is not necessary that the condition should be on I. The condition means that condition when Tata Bye Bye is finished.Let's go to the loop then we write here i + p means the value of i will keep increasing by one as soon as the loop ends the first one round of the loop is increased by one the next round is increased by one so what is happening here is first a is printed then look in the output if I come then what is the first work being done first of all our work is getting a printed
What is happening is that our value of a is 100 so 100 is printed and there is a space so one space is also printed ours is ok so 100 is printed then our value a = a - 3 then three is reduced from a so the value of a becomes 97 then as soon as this work is done I said first of all our check is fine but what is the check here one thing that I forgot to tell you before running the loop, we are not inside the loop.First of all, I made a box, then we checked, is a greater than 0, is 100 greater than zero, of course, go ahead, brother, you do all these things, printed it, then increased the value of a to 97, then came back here, then increased the value of i, sorry i+ P, then increased the value of i, so we increased the value of i to two, then we came back in the loop, we saw that this thing has already happened once, what from 97 to zero.It has increased, go ahead, print 97 same value, reduce it to 94, brother, so here it is done, 94. Do you understand what I am trying to say here, you can print it better than wide loop, I will tell you that later, but here you are understanding what is coming 91 88, just like this, our friend, the rest of the things will keep getting printed, for how long will we come to the last, when the value of a94 automatically first one will be printed, then when the value becomes -2, it will make the condition violet, hence it will not enter inside the loop. If you understand, then this was a very good method, in this you did not need to check this thing, like you did not need to find out the formula, like in maths, we could have done this directly, take out 34 and write 34, but this was a better code which I wrote and showed you here, let's move ahead friend.Display This GP Now this is our homework, we have 100 50 25, you have to display this till the end terms but keep in mind here Baba, first of all our term is 100, keep in mind that I will tell you this, here again the next term is 50, then the next term is 25, you can see, it is being multiplied by half, it is being multiplied by half, 25, if it was multiplied by half, then the answer would be 12.5.25/2 We cannot store it in integer, here you use float variable, whose float variable do you use because every time you have to print GP or print anything, then in for loop, you take the same thing, take anti in for loop, take int i = 1, take n and i + p, that is, our loop will run n times, whatever is our thing inside, here we will run n times, but you just create a new variable.Introduce a by name int a equal to two whatever your number is 100 float a sorry float because later on go invent I hope you will be understanding all these things and also take a above you have to take a from the user input and here you have to write a let's go ahead friend now see whatever you put inside the loop it all gets repeated what I mean to say by this is that I have already told you that it is not necessary that there should be a statement inside the loop.There will be many statements inside so all the things will be repeated like if I write for anything and here if I write line our line one then here I write line number two statement three line three as many as we want then all these will be repeated as many times as we will put the loop. Already we have discussed like coming to this code for aa this one so look here it is getting printed again and again and this which is a = a - 3 this is also loop again and again.Every time it is going on, this thing is going on inside it, let's go ahead, friend break o ho ho, very cute question, now I am going to solve for you the question of loops which is ours. If you have ever written a write a program, then it means write a program to check if a number is a prime number and not. This is a very cute thing. This is how we solve it using the break statement. So, let us read our break statement with this question.The question given to me is to write a program to check if a number is a prime number and not. So, first of all, let's talk about what is a prime number. Now here I will expect from you that you have studied so much maths of second third class that you know a prime number. What is the definition of a prime number? Prime is that number. Suppose if my number is n then it has two factors only n and 1. Apart from these there are no other factors.be like you
Everyone knows the prime number starts with two. Two is the only even prime. Prime number then comes our three. All the evens are our composite numbers except two. Then comes your five. Then you know or comes seven. Nine is not a prime number. 11 is 13. 17 is 19. 21 is not 23. And so on. Okay, let's keep going. Finite numbers are prime numbers.Basically, this means that prime numbers have only two factors, that is number and one, apart from that they do not have any other factors, so what do we have to do, we have to take input from the user, a number n. Okay, so we have to make a program which will tell us by writing that if we have entered n, then it should write that yes, this number is prime or else it should come by writing that this number is composite. Composite is the one which is not prime, as we had done in the first question in the if statement, odd andTo find even number, here we are talking about finding prime or composite number, but how did this question come inside my for loop, it is a matter of thinking, okay, so here I will tell you the working rule of it, I will anchor it a little, I can just give you a hint that through for loop and another hint that we will solve this question by dividing through factors, now you pause.You can try it, but let me tell you its complete working once, I am going to solve it directly in stages, I will not write the answer to it, comfortably explain one thing to you, you will get the essence of for loop and break statement. Actually, okay, so let's see, what should I do, tell me one thing, like here is my number, if I write 25, then I know friend, this is a composite number, I know this is a composite number.This is clearly known to happen but if I write a very big number 2753 2753 then I don't know whether it is prime or composite, okay then what is the way to check it, if I divide this number from one to whatever number is 2753 and it is not divisible by any number other than one and this number, then it is prime, it is simple, no number is different from itself and one.If it is not divisible by any other number, then what is our number? If it is a prime number, then we will keep checking by dividing. All the numbers are within the same range. Suppose our number is 25. So what is our working rule here? Let me show you, if I show you the steps, what will we do? We will divide all the numbers from two to 24, that is, we will divide 25. We will not look at dividing all these numbers by one, off course.25 is divisible by one, if I write 25 model 1 then its value will come to us because it is divisible but is 25 divisible by two otherwise what will I do from two to whatever is my number if n is then n - 1 if it is 25 then what will I do till 24 I will divide my number like I will check Reminder is 25 divisible by two so how to check it you allYou know, if you see this row has come, that means it is divisible by two, then it has become composite, but we know that if it does not come, then it is not divisible by two, it is not ours, we have not tried this, okay, then we divided 25 by three, we saw that reminder, of course, zero is not coming, so it is not divisible by three, 25 is ours, okay, by doing like this, we went to 25, friend, by four, weSee, it is not divisible, then we saw that if we divide 25 by f, then yes this is equal to zero. It is divisible by pa, so it simply means that if 25 is divisible by any number other than 25, then it is a composite number. It is a simple thing, so we are going to solve our question like this and obviously because I have to divide it by many numbers, then I have to look at one.I will have to put a loop, okay, I will have to put a loop, but here I know what my problem will be, I will try to explain to you whether my problem will come, it is okay here, like I write the code directly and explain it to you, step by step, we will do the coding directly, I am not going to write the answer to it so that you can easily understand all the things, so inside the loops, we make our friend, what is the prime number, this is a very good question for your semester.Media has every chance of appearing in the exam.
It has to come in one of the ends, okay is this done or reverse number, this question means it is standard, it comes as it comes, okay, there is no one of these, there is no that, okay, so we write our code, I write int main function and then I write return zero, okay, now we write our code, so first of all, of course, we have to input a number, so assume this is our number, then we also write that print F, enter a number.Okay and we take the input of the number, man, from our which scan F, we do this work so scan F, percentage D and and A and where did it go man and here is the and A. Okay, now we have to do our whole process, I have to tell whether the number is prime or the number is composite, so I can tell directly as soon as I hit my condition, meaning as we come here, I saw that 25 modus 2 is equal to rho, meaning what is two to.Is divisible by 25 No is divisible by three No is by four No is by five Yes so as soon as I say yes then I can print it So can I print it What can I print that the number is composite and when it is not divisible then I can just move ahead I can skip Okay, there is no need to do anything meaningful here So let's come here to see what I want to do, I just write for int i into two right nowI will make a mistake on purpose, I have to start from two, what do I have to do, pay attention from two i e < i n - 1 From two to a number, just divide all the numbers by that number, because the factors of a number, keep in mind that they are factors, what is the meaning of prime number, the number has only two factors, n and if n is a number, then if there are any other factors of a composite number, then they bring the meaning inside it.The factor of any number will always be smaller than that, it is never bigger. The factor of 8 cannot be 16. Okay, so that's why we are running from 2 to n-1. Okay, don't consider one because that will be the correct answer. Now we will do i ps and here you directly apply the if condition. First of all, the value of aa is two. Okay, if I say if which is my number n, if it is divisible by aa, that is, a.Modus a is equal to ictu 0, this means we have seen in our previous lecture, so you can do one thing, print it brother, no, we have found out that our number is less, okay, we will run it once for 25 and see if it happens, now once we run this code first and then we will see about it, there is a lot of fluff in it, we are okay, if we run then enter the number, then I say 25, okay, then see what is written.Here comes our number is positive or the given number is positive, let's write the given number is positive. Once we run it back here, write 25 the given number is composite. So it is ok but still we could not find out anything for the prime number. How does it mean? Look, if I run the Dalu code here, I write here 23 23 is a prime number, then look, the code is finished, nothing came, so what do we do for the prime.Because we will not be able to write anything, for that you understand what I am trying to say, I cannot say that if n modus a is not equal to zero. Look, suppose if I write else, that means if my number is not divisible, then here I will not write this. Look, print F, it will get messed up, otherwise if I write this, then it will be very wrong because see, if I run and do this here.I am 23, so look at how many times The number is prime, The number is prime, The number is prime, how many times has it come, man, this is not ending as if I put back sl so that you can understand, I will run the code again like I write seven, then see how many times The number is prime has come, So we only had to know about it once, okay and the problem is that if I add the number six here, which is a composite number, then it will also be written The number is composite, The number isIt is necessary to put prime one second back slash and end. Let's run it back once. Suppose the number is six. The number is composite composite prime. Prime is not coming. If so, then the result is coming wrong. So what do we do once? Let's remove this thing. This is the code that I have written, isn't it? From this code, I will be able to know that a number is mine.
Is it composite or not? See, it is a very simple thing, but in this also my problem is to know where it will come. Look again, if I run it and see, for example, I had entered 25, then the number e composite was written once, but if I suppose I write 10, then the number e composite is being written twice, so again and again, so I don't want it to be written once, I want it to be written only once, okay, here we use our break condition, now one.Let me try to explain to you what the break condition does for me, but before that, let us dry run this code once. It is possible that some of you may be going beyond the heads of your children. It is okay, do it politely, I am going to dry run this code and show it to you. Okay, here is the code, come here, okay brother, come here, come here, come to your pen copy, I did it, so I made a box late, I did n.I gave the value of n by myself, if I gave it, let's say 6, it is okay or I gave anything, the value of n, if I write a, I write 25, then here is the problem, do you know what is coming, I took the number, everything, enter the number, it came to the output, the loop ran, then in the loop, I told you, first of all, what happens is int i = 2, then a box named i is also created, the value of i is two for now and how much of i is mine.i < = 25 - 1 then it will go till 244 from two to 24 and our increment is of one each. First check n modus aa 25 modus 2 is divisible by 252 otherwise this statement is over then for loop is over then comes back new round of for loop. We are in for loop as many rounds as there are number of times for loop runs. We call these rounds as actually in.We call rounds as iterations. You must have heard it or read it from somewhere. Those who don't know, we call it in fancy term. Iterative means one by one, gradually, okay, step by step, then the value of our aa is plus plus, aa becomes our three. Then checked whether my 25 is divisible by three, otherwise it is okay, this too is not printed back, nothing happened, moved ahead, then as soon as my friend came.Cut cut to four five came then saw is 25 diva module f equal to zero yes so what happened to our thing it got printed but then it increased to six became six checked it happened to seven then coincidentally what are the factors of 25 one is one factor of 25 so we know it is 2 and if f is equal to zero then there are only three ok so in this we came to know that my number is composite but do you know what is the problem this isThe loop is this, the loop inside this loop of mine has gone from two to 24. Okay, if you understand, then understand that my loop has run 23 times. The loop has run 23 times. Okay, but how many times was it supposed to run only 3 4 5. Why four times? Because look, when the value of my aa became two, then three, then four, e f, but I came to know that it is composite, so mine should be eliminated, right, that is the same loop.Why should I go further, listen to one thing, as there are many factors in a composite number, now as soon as I have understood, like six is a composite number, one is fine, there are factors of six, one two, 6 is fine, or if we take factors of 12, if there are too many, then it will be more correct, the factors of 12 are my one, two, three, four, six, then our 12 is fine, so when the loop will run in 12, as soon as you divide by two, you will know.It seems that a number is divisible, so why should I run the loop further? For three, for four, for five, for six, that is, why should I run the entire loop? It would not make any sense to run the loop from two to 11, from two to 11, so there should be some way by which I can know that I can end the loop by doing tata bye bye. Here we use r for our break statement. This is the break statement. It is used to it is ok.Is used to terminate It is used to terminate Now what is this terminate? Let me do one thing. Let me show you this thing in the code. Once let's do one thing. Let us come to the code and see how the break statement works. So see, I definitely know that as soon as my number is divisible by any number within the same range, then it is a factor of it. See, it being zero means that it is a factor of.n Okay, so I found out directly that the number is composite, there is no need to run the loop further, okay so far.
I didn't find out whether the number is prime or not but no problem, I don't need to run the loop further, so we know what we do in this, pay attention inside this statement, I printed it, now look here, I will write break semicolon, now you will see it is coming in pink color, so it is clearly visible, the pink thing is visible, you can see the include is in pink, for is in pink, return is in pink, all these are special keywords, it is clearly visible in front of this.Nothing else has to be written. Do you know the meaning of this break? Now like if I run with this break, suppose I write 'Ch', enter number six, it is written only once. 'The number is composite'. Suppose I have removed it, I write 'Enter a number 12' in '12', then see how many times it has been written. 'The given number is composite', 'Composite', 'Composite', why is it happening that when I give input '12', it is written four times.The number is composite, I came to know in one go that it is composite because first of all when I tried dividing by two, I hit the yes condition and if the inner line went, then what happened in the next line, I did it with three, still the line went, then one more time, The number is composite, it was written, then again with four, it was written again with five, it was not written, it came with six, it was written again with 7 8 9 10 11, then I tried dividing by 7 8 9 10 11.12 did not come, so it came four times, as soon as I write break, what happens in one turn, the whole loop ends, after that the loop does not run, after that it does not get repeated, no further rounds of the loop come, so this is a very wonderful thing, loop here, if I now write 12, then it will be written only once, the given number is composite, similarly, if I run a, sorry, once I write here this break.Let's blow up the statement. I run it once and I write here that 24 will be written many times. Why is it being written so many times? These are factors of 24 other than 12, 24 is divisible by two, is divided by three. Look, the first is divisible by two, 24 is also divided by th, it is also divisible by four, then it is also divisible by six, then it is also divisible by eight and it is also divisible by 12, okay.Are you understanding what I am trying to say, maybe anyone who knows a little bit of maths would be understanding, but as soon as I put the brakes, of course I write 24, it will be written only once, The given number is composite. So, we have successfully written our code for how to find out if a given number is composite and not. This code is not for find out if a given number is prime and not.But we have to find out whether the number is prime or not. Okay, we have seen that when a number is composite, using the break statement, clearly this is a good code. So much so that our code is clear that the number is our composite or not. Now you will say, okay, if I run and write 23 or 47 is a prime number, then look, nothing is being written, then you can say one thing definitely from here, nothing is being written because 47.We divided it by all the numbers from 2 to 46 and it is not divisible by anything, so if nothing is coming then you can say ok brother, if nothing is coming then it would clearly mean that it is prime but it is not coming, so what should we do so that it is written that the number is prime because look, after the for loop, now you will think that we write next, no print F, it is okay, we write Y print F, there is no question of plus here if you see.You write 'else', do you know what problem comes again? If here we write 'else' that our number is not divisible, then many times it will be written that 'prime number is prime number, prime number is prime number', you have seen that it gets messed up, okay, so what should we do so that we can store it somewhere that friend, this loop is not printed even once, so how do we control it, how do we control this thing, so here we useWhat is the meaning of an additional box, let's come here once and let's see, we also write this code once more and let's see what is missing in our code. Let's come once and write in this code. Let's come here, let me explain to you the whole algorithm again. Well, let me explain to you. Okay, what did I do? My number is my number, I have taken n. Then I
I divided n from 0 to where till n is divided and saw that it is okay if my number is divisible by any of these then it is clear that my number will become composite composite and I noticed one more thing if I put a break statement right there and then and there, if I put a break right there then it is okay, it is over, I came to know about composite, it is fine here but for prime I know what one thing I can do.Instead of like, what I said is that if my number is being divided, if look, if a modus is equal to 0, here I was printing that the number is composite. Instead of printing, I can do one thing, first of all, I can declare a number, I can create a box from Let's say a variable named int a and inside a, I store zero, okay, I store it here.Zero, if my number is divisible, what can I do instead of printing. If the condition hits, if the number is divisible, then I will store the one inside a. Okay, and then I will apply the break. If I brake, then the loop ends and as soon as the loop ends, now I will check again whether a is my zero. It still means that if it has not changed, then the number is my prime, otherwise my number is composite. I will print it like this. Once I code it, I will show you a little more clarity.It will look okay, here simple look instead of doing this thing, okay, let's remove the commandGiven number e prime Otherwise here I can write Else The given number e composite Let's run it once and see what I want to say, so see Enter number 24 The number e composite Let's move ahead Enter number 43 The number e prime Okay, now let's try it step by step once and run it a draw This code is quite powerful, ours is fine So let's dry run it and see a little bit from here that we have used A in a big waySmartly done here, we took one extra box and then we used it, I take one more page, friend, and a little bit of this, then I take it there, okay, look at this code very carefully, I have written a number separately, like we had n, there was a number which was inputted, suppose if I take instead of n, if I take 43, okay, I have created a box, which I have first initialized to two, then its value increases, that is, okay, write it like this.Give it to me brother where did it go yes here is that the value of a is first taken to curry and then up to see it will come from n to n-1 and I have created a box a in which for now I have rows stored okay in step by step what if my number is actually prime which I know is 43 prime then it will not hit this condition even once. This condition will not hit at all because the prime number will not be divisible from two ton-1 is never divisible, so this condition will never happen, there will never be a break, the value of a will never be one, because this thing will never run, the loop will keep going on again and again but it will never be hit, then we will come straight here and the value of a will remain zero of zero, then it will just be printed, then the number is prime, so in the case of 43, what happened is that if instead of 43, suppose my number is 24, which is a composite number.My is 24 so if I divide 24 by let's here pay yr two then it gets hit in the very first condition that yes true break happened but before the break happened as soon as the condition became true then in the box of 'a' instead of 'row' one came 'break condition' then the loop is completely finished and will not go beyond that then directly see is a equal to 0 or else a means anything other than row then print this then the number iscomposite is ok still there is a small flaw in this code first of all tell in the comments if you can identify I put any number in it like if I put 99 then of course that is also a composite number it is divided by 33 if I put a number here 91 then that is also a composite number if I put 93 then it is prime number
ok oh sorry 93 is also composite I am so sorry of course I enter the number here 83 ok so that is a prime number for me ok so this is working for me but if I enter the number two then two is a prime number according to you what is the answer aga according to me it will give composite the number is prime ok the loop will not work oho I have written the right code by chance I am ok what is happening I was thinking thatLike here we were starting to divide by two, then if we divide two by two then the composite will be written but no prime number is coming, why is this if the number is two, I had said any number, look here, if my number is n, then I run the value of i from 2 to n -1, then if my number a is my z, then I will run the value of a from y to one, then the loop will not run at all.This means to shorten a loop from two to one. It is a simple thing, isn't it, friend? Suppose, I have given two to a here and a is the lesson, then the condition will never be hit. If it is smaller than two, then the loop will never work. Okay, so in the case of two, the number is prime, but if I write one here, what is happening here, then it comes here. If I write one here, then in the case of one too, friend.Here it is written that the given number is prime whereas one is not my prime. What will happen again in the case of one? If the value of n is one then aa mine will go from -1 i.e. till zero then our again loop is not going to run then the if loop will not run. In any case when the loop is not going on the same prime number is ours only then the value of our one does not change so that is why our number becomes prime. Here in the loop but it is not happening in one but one.What is one is neither prime nor composite, so what do we do in that case, we can know this, see here I write if, let's put a condition here, simple C is fine, here if n is equal to two is equal to two, then here I can print print F, one is neither prime nor composite, composite is fine, but here I have to put the condition of L only, okay because a, in that case.Also, what do you say about us, zero will remain only, right friend, so here I write else if and in the last we write else. Now let's run it once and see if I write one then the answer is one is neither prime nor composite because it is not working in it. Look, if I write enter number two then it is coming prime. If I write enter number five then it is coming my prime. Of course everything will work okay so we look at one.We have also seen the condition here, if the number is smaller than one then we will not take the input, okay we will not take zero, even zero is nothing, in such a situation, let us see the condition of two, it is automatically covered because it could never be hit by chance, but for that also we can make it separately. Even if n is 2, what is that, our nether prime nor composite situation will come, okay, so I hope you will get the code of this prime number.I have slowly explained a little bit so that you can understand it well. Okay, let's move towards the next question. From here, you must have understood the meaning of break statement. When the loop has to be broken, it does not have to be run again and again unnecessarily. Okay, let's move ahead and come to the continue statement. Again, if our break looks like this, then the continue statement is just a little bit of it. I use continue for a question.I will get it through, okay you will understand, our question is to write a program to print odd numbers from 1 to 100, so we have written this code long ago, how we used to write, it is very simple for int i = 1, then i < = 100, then we used to write i + p, here we will just put a condition that if my number which is here is also taken as 10, then it is not divisible by i.Equal to 0 means divisible sorry a what am I saying if my a a a modus two because a a then I will print 1 2 3 4 all the numbers are being printed but I put the condition if it is not equal to zero i.e. this is our friend number is odd understand that only if it is an odd number I will print that number friend print f aa ok I will write here print f aa so we have seen this but now we are going to do itUse of continue statement
So once quickly, no friend, come here to your code and create your file, then let's create a new file of our own. To learn the continue statement for the new question, I come inside the loops and here we create the file continue dot C. Okay, in this we will also give you a homework, friend, again write all the things for continue. Brother, include, copy paste, copy paste this code from the prime number, first copy and paste this code once, it is a different code.But no problem, why write things again and again, I told you about 'do not repeat yourself', it is okay inside the loop, so of course, here also we will take the number as input, enter the number, we will write all the things, we will not take it because we have to run the straight loop, we would have written it from the beginning, let's come from one, we will run it from one to 100, we want till 100, okay and we will see if my aa is divisible by two, not equal.To 0 First of all, once I show you this code again, then I can simply write, what print F Percentage D space is okay here and this is the next thing that is removed, otherwise we run this code further. Look at this code 1 579 99, all the odd numbers have been printed. Now we could have done this question with the continue statement also. How to pay attention, I can write here if a modulus is equal to two.Equal to G, so it means even numbers will be printed. Look, all the numbers from two to 100, now see one thing, here I write it, instead of this we remove it and here I write Co. New Country New, okay and outside I write this thing. Okay, for one turn, we remove this too. Assume that if I just print F, then all the numbers from one to 100 will be printed. Look, from one to 100, because I just print it.Gave it and ran it from one to 100, now what I just wrote is that if look at my number, if my number is even, because what does it mean, it is an even number, then if my number here is even, then I just said continue, so now let's see what the result will be, see 57, how come, when I have written this print statement outside, look, whatever this statement is, it should not have anything to do with it, all the numbers should be printed, let's dry run it once and after fully disclosing it.Let's finish the statement quickly. Okay, it's a matter of two minutes. Continue statement is not going to be of much use to you. Well, it may be useful in some codes. Okay, this is just like an alternate. The kind of it is not necessary. Break statement is very necessary, but see what is happening. Let's do a dry run. The value of i is one. Of course, it is going up to 100. So, first of all, I checked that the value of my a is one, is it from one to two?Is divisible, no, then this if condition did not work, okay, we went straight to print FI, here if we see the output, print FI, then one is printed with a space, come, okay, here again we went to the value aa, two is done, lesson 100, yes, go ahead, if two is divisible by my two, yes, so we went inside the loop, inside the loop, here it is written continue whenever inside the loop, when you saw the break.If it is written, then the loop itself ends and the code goes ahead completely. When continue is written, it means that round of the loop, that iteration of the loop, which I taught you the fancy word, skip it for now. Continue means skip that round, skip that round, skip that round of the loop, so whenever I did like two, then 2 muddled two is getting equal to 0 because so this round.It was skipped when the value of my aa increased to two. Look, okay then what happened, the value of aa increased to three, then the condition was not hit again. It came straight here and it was printed. Then the value of my aa increased to four. 4 turns into 0. Yes, see, continue. So in the next statement, we did not go to continue. Meaning, we skipped this round and came to the next round of the loop, in which the value of i will be fixed.If you understand, then this is also an alternative way of doing things like printing. Okay, homework is yours I guess I must have given, no, let's take it, friend, take your homework here, friend, is the homework going to be there? Write a program to print, of course, you must have understood. All the right, even numbers, even numbers from n to 100, from one to n, take it either way, let's take 100, no problem, okay, using continue statement.
By using continue statement, you have to do basically the opposite thing. Continue statement. Here you do this that whenever the number comes my odd, then skip it. Okay, let's move ahead friend. Now we are going to do our while loop in for loop. We have seen a lot of things now. Now we are using while loop. Now a lot of people are using while loop. We read the while loop first and then read the while loop first. From the for loop, whom should I give a preference to?For loop is much easier, in it all the things are already given. In the while loop, there are many things similar to the for loop, but you will see and notice the difference. What used to happen in the for loop, my friend, first of all, here I used to be the initialization like i = 1, then my condition also used to be, let's say i takes 10, then ours used to be i. P. Okay and the whole loop used to run inside whereas in the while loop, what happens is that the initialization is not here.This happens before the wide loop, as I had shown you in the for loop also, do you remember when I had just written this and had entered it above, okay, in this we have taken out the entire initial statement in the while loop, which is the second and third thing in the while loop. Updation means increment, increase or decrease the value, it is done inside the code. This can also happen in our for loop. I will tell you, but all these things happen in the wide loop, okay, so this is the difference here.But before that I want to ask you that if my code is like this print F is ok then here if I write percentage d and I write aa then what will be its output tell in the comments aa is the value of one is less than 10 is less than 10 is not equal to 10 then the only print will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 no because as soon as it becomes 10 10 is not equal to two10 So you keep this in mind, I have not taken the examples yet, I always write this i is less equal to two, like come here, no man, come in the code with your break, in the code with prime number, then instead of writing i is less n - 1, I can also write this, it will not make any difference, i is less n because if there is any integer smaller than n, then it is this one, right, like see, I run it the same thing.I will write three is a prime number, okay, so this thing is also valid, we can write it in both the ways, like i, e, e, e, 100, we can also write i, e, 10, the thing is the same, so let's come here little by little, let's try to understand the while loop, what happens in the while loop, let's see with some examples, the while loop also, after that we will do it, okay, consider the same question, let me print from one to 10.Like this is our code, what will it do for us, let's take an example here, let's go through the coding and go into the loop, we are going to ask a lot of questions about the Y loop. Okay, so we create Y dot C and here also we write something from the beginning, let's say sorry include std d h int main function return zero, okay and let's try to write our code here. Let's say anything, I have to print it from the Y loop.Numbers from one to 10 or up to 100 are int, so I write them like this. See, I have already declared from to 100 in the while, now I will write while, okay, I will write Y, come lane equals 100 and I will directly print F. Okay, what is the percentage of your number? Come and here I write inside this increment statement of the code. So let's see what will happen in it. Look, all the numbers from one to 100 will be printed.So, it is somewhat similar to a for loop, but while loop has its advantages and disadvantages, the main advantage is that you do not know where it is starting from or what is happening, that is, when we go ahead with some examples, in the next lecture, I will be able to explain to you more easily why we are using while loop, but if you do not know things, you know less about things, then keep this thing in mind. Conditions.If you know less about for loop or you are not able to understand that how do I adjust the things in the for loop, then we use the while loop here. Okay, whatever our condition is being created, it is breaking, then we use the while loop. That work can also be done in the for loop, but we prefer the while loop in it. Now, we will do a lot of examples which are based on the while loop, so there I will explain to you in this video, so this thing is fine.Ours is done if I do lesson 10
So there is only one thing, brother, the same will come printed till 100 because I have done the lesson, okay, now there is one thing here, if I had written zero, then of course zero would also have been printed for me, then this is the essence of the while loop, only where is the condition written inside me, and usually we use it when we do not know many things, when we do not know many things, okay, when you have an idea about things, then use for loop.And if we don't know much about how to construct the loop, then we can do this. Well, if I try to dry run it, you try it yourself on pen and paper. Here I will just tell you that see what happens int i = 1, this is a little more a, what does it say, is it more understandable code, how do I write the value of i, one while, as long as i is, whatever is my condition, as long as this condition is there, as long as my a is less than 10, keep printing.So printed I printed that the value of a is increased to t Is 2 smaller than 10 Yes exactly print back that the value of a is smaller than 10 Is it smaller than 10 Next print further keep doing keep doing keep doing keep doing so by doing this our thing which is and becomes ok ok tell me one thing if I write aa instead of apsps aa minus minus value do you know the meaning of minus or else I will write aa aaMinus and means like the value of aa is first one then keep decreasing then see now there will be problem if you don't go back see this o what is happening what is happening what is happening arererere hey the code is not ending no stop stop stop please please what is happening o we call this or infa loop once we stop it and put plus here and run it very good scored 100 ok now what was happening man that my loopGoing on, going on, going on, let's discuss a little bit about this, let's fine fine it loops, look at what usually happens in a loop, there is an inital exit condition and one of our as far as we are going to terminate, so if I write that here, if I write int aa = 1 and here I write while as long as my aa is less than 10, see the problem, now print aa here, then print f.Percentage D here put a but here subtract the value of a from one i minus minus means subtract from one so know the problem in this code what is coming first the value of i what happened to us if I write in the box see the value of i becomes one first then what is printed in the output let's go what is less than 10 condition checked yes it is small ok print one ok here we are.You can also put one thing, we do one thing, we put ba n, we put ba s n, okay, print one, give one enter, the next thing to be printed in the next line is i - minus the value of i, the value of i has decreased by one, now the value of i has become zero, okay, the value of i has decreased by one, it has become row, then checked whether row is smaller than 10. If it is true, print it, then row has been printed, then given the value of i and reduced the value of i by one more from row.Small -1 Is -1 smaller than 10 Yes, now you must have understood -1 is also smaller than 10 -2 will also be smaller than 10 All the numbers are smaller than 10 So a condition is sometimes fulfilled meaning it is always happening What does while mean As long as this condition As long as this is true As long as this condition is followed Keep executing the inside thing So what is the problem now -4 -5 ThisThe loop will keep going because that number is always less than 10, so we call this case infighting, it will keep going on, it will keep going on, again we can do all these things in the for loop also, it is okay in the for loop also, if we write some teddy thing that int i = 1, for int i = 1, I write i < 10 and i minus minus, then the value will keep decreasing and the value will keep going on, the loop will never end, okay, so such cases.We will use the infinitive loop. I want to explain the do while loop to you in some clarity by doing questions. Let's talk about this lure. We will see about it. This is essentially what is called useless, so it is useless. I am teaching this only to you because sometimes it is possible that the same code may accidentally appear in the placement test in your semester exam. By using do while, you should not know the thing about ternary operator.If something is done ok then what is our first question? Above the while loop we make many predict the output questions.
The first question is main int j ok box is created j name is ok while j e lesson equal to 10 print f here pay back sl a percentage d j j e equal j p 1 oh re re re so here friend you are not giving any value to j and it is asking us to keep printing as long as j is less than 10 and also make j equal to j pw then what happens in this case whenI don't have any value of J given and then the comparison is happening like if J is lesson 10, then inside J, the garbage value of type C comes. Okay, what is the garbage value? Once I run this code, I will show you and explain what is the problem with this code. It is okay, it is an error. Of course, if seen technically, then we write here predict one dc and we do a littleLet's create a file here for the while loop by copy and pasting, okay again and again, so we don't like to write things down a bit, we have written int j, then while j lesson equal to 10, then print a is j is yes of course and we have given here back sl a j is j p. Okay, so let's run this code and see the problem. Nothing happened, nothing happened, the code didn't even run. Let's see once, nothing happened. Okay, once.We print 'j' and see what will happen before the loop, meaning the thing has not gone inside the loop. First of all, if nothing has happened, it means that the condition has never been hit. I do one thing, print F command C. Let's print it directly. We have created a box named 'j'. We want to know what value of 'j' will be printed. Oh, this is a very dirty thing, look, the value of 'j' is coming 3375 826. Okay, so what should the computer say?The value of j is this, whereas I have not given any value to j. Now because the value of j is so dirty, then of course, this is such a big value, our th is a very big number, it is not smaller than 10, whereas here it is written that when j is smaller than 10, then run this loop and keep running till it is smaller than 10. If it is not there, then the loop is not running, so this is our concept of garbage value here.Error has not come, this thing gives error in Java c c+ p, here there is a concept of garbage value, that means we can say random, random value is ok, we will give some random number to j, it will get a random number here, okay now it is possible that garbage can be inside w, we can also get zero value to j, ok, c can be any number, it is not necessary that the dirty number that you see.It is 3375 8, it can be any number, so if there was zero here, what would have been the scene, is zero smaller than 10? Yes, zero would have been printed, then zero would have become our one. Do you understand that in some cases, our answer may depend on the value, J may get garbage value, my five is fine, so it will be written here, is five smaller than 10, yes, print the value of five, then print six.Look, then seven will be printed. 9, 10, finally, 11 will not be printed. Okay, but this will be a very subjective question, so we will directly write the garbage value will come. I am fine, usually no answer will come. Let's move ahead, friend. Got to learn a good concept. Predict the output main int aa key value given one. Created a box named aa. Inside that we gave one value. Okay till aa comes my 10.Is it smaller than 10 or is it smaller than 10? Keep printing the value of a by giving a back slash and come on. So it's very straight forward man, there is a question if I go to the output. Okay, this is a very straight forward question. What is the value of i and is it smaller than 10. Just print it out. Back slash N. First of all give an enter already. Nothing will be printed on the first line. Enter and we will print our i.Given the value of i, one, okay, then we went back, i Ps, change the value of i to two, is two smaller than 10, of course, go ahead, print the value of 10, but give an enter, first of all, first we gave one enter, here we printed two, then again like this, let's say three is printed, four is printed, five is printed, six is printed, 7 8 9 10, but when i my Katpat K 11.If it is done, then 11 will not be printed here, then this will be our output, one extra line will also come, code it yourself and see, consider it as a class work, let's go ahead, friend, predict the output int x = 1, then x
A box of grams has been created in which our one value has gone. Further while x = ect 1. If the value ofBy giving one column n, the output will be something like this. First of all, if we give one column n, then nothing will be written on the first line. Then we printed x. If the value of x is zero, then zero is printed. Now we go back to the loop whileYou can also see by coding once, just by coding, see here, if I give it ev, then write the friend, remove this thing here, whileWhat have you given to me in the output? Main function intI have told you this thing, we call them increment and decrement operators. Okay and to be very specific. If I writeP 1 and minus minOur post increment post and we call it pre increment, let me explain to you the meaning of pre increment. Whenever I print this thing inside my code, we come here and talk about post and pre increment, then we solve that question. Okay, so post pred c is okay, here we write sh include th, why is it coming, is include add h okay AD funt main function, then we will write return here.And here, if you try to write your code, then let me teach you something, look, if I write int x = 4 5 or else of course, if I normally print my value, then you all know what is the value ofSame thing, I copy and paste this same statement, right here, control C control, if I have taught you everything, then it means that the meaning ofGoing back, let's talk about x pps and I should not use x pp here, I should do one thing, should I write thisLet me write here P + x both work the same
But here my six is printed. Okay, so what is the difference between these two? When I writeThis means plus x x means increment first then increment then use ok are you understanding what is happening but first increment is happening then our is being used use after whose increment use means first increment then use then it is ok so off course here whenever I write na + + x then its meaning becomes that now friend let's come to this code a little bit like thisThe code knows how much is the identification. Pay attention, my -So - - x first of all the work was done, tripled the value ofIf you understand that this is our work, then it is our job, so it is something like this: 2 33 We printed the final value, what is the value of PardiI have to predict an output. I have given intex e 4 y = 3 and then I have given z. Okay, so a box was made.Minus minus, when I used to write it directly in print F also, okay, what was its significant? First thing, what it did was, it would keep the original value of x and then decrement the value ofIf y is treated like 3 then the value of z will be 4 - 3. Second thing is x minus minus so first we took out the value ofNothing will be printed. One will be printed in the next line, one is entered, then percentage DD is corresponding to one, this is to y, this is to z, what is the value ofSo the value ofAnd one enter, okay, this is the space, that's why I have given the space, okay, let's move ahead and solve the next question, my next question is also giving the exact output, while here.
The question of loop is while character A is lesson character B print F here it is written bak sl n Malayalam is a palindrome Palindrome means look M then A then L and palindrome is not there Mala alam it is the spelling is wrong these people have written it right it happens Mala farya lam is ok this is the spelling anyway there can be a technical error anyway a text is printed hereIt is written that while A is less than B, then according to you, what will this code do, according to me, this code was an infinito that if the S value of a character is 97, if A's is equal to B, then how much will be one more than B's, 98, so here it is written while 97 is 98, so it will always remain small, even if there is no change inside these variables, it will keep on getting printed, okay, so it will give us an info loop, meaning here it will be printed back slash and then what do you say?The output will be something like this, let me show you the output. First of all, this will be written in the next line. Malayalam and sobi, whatever it is, then again this information will be written like this, it will be written, it will not end. Sometimes I will code it and show it to you. If you want, then it is written while while then A is less than the character B and in the next line, okay friend, one more thing here which I had left by chance. When I talk about for loop and while loop, as if I had told you in the if statement.No if there is only one sentence inside the for loop like come here predict the output here there are two sentences there is no sentence in any of them is AP is in GP is AP is odd Look inside this code like let's say this is a random code Don't look at it right now what is written in the code Just look at what is written in the code So like if there was only one sentence in the if then I can remove these curly brackets so all the thingsIt is sorted, I can write it like this, one more thing, if I want, I can write it here too, okay, so we can do all these things, so if we write anything here, suppose look, after printing F, I write anything, I will put it here and inside it, so either friend, whether we put it in semicalculus or not, it is considered inside the vial itself, only one line, the other line will not be considered, if there is no curly bracket, then it is okay, then it is written here.There is back slush N and it is written Mal is Mala Hota Mala or Lam is a palan drome Okay then we will print this Ofcourse it will be printed many times Look let's move it a little higher and the infa loop will come Okay look at this it is not ending and is going away Look below you are still seeing there is no strange error Look I will move it up here where did it go Yes okay so this is being written means it is not ending Too much infa loop has come So in this situation thisClick the box, okay, end the question, let's move ahead, friend, we were absolutely right. Predict the output main function in I E 10. Make the box, the value of A is 10. Then it is written while A E 20 print F. Here it is written my base sl n computer buff. Very very beautiful question. There is going to be a beautiful question here. The output is going to come, what is ours, like it came last time in Malayalam.Infineon is fine for me, I have written i = 20 because what is written here and here print F, whatever is written inside, but let's say it is written in it, a computer buff, okay, so this too will run in the infa bar, okay, look, the infyting is also coming, the computer buff is coming, it is not ending, so let's try to go up once, it is going, otherwise this infine is happening that an infa loop is going on, it is okay. In the previous one, I explained that ourThis is going on indefinitely because 97 will always be less than 98 so this condition will always be true so this loop will never end. Similarly what is happening here is int i = 10. You will say here it is written that i is equal to 20. No if it was written here i = i is 20 then it would mean if i is equal to 20 like in if then go on till i is equal to 20 ok but not i =The meaning of 20 is put 20 here, then put 20, then the inside thing, we went inside the loop, everything is printed, then we come back here, put 20, okay, then after cutting the previous 20, we will put only 20, so this will keep going on again and again, our loop will never end because because there is no termination in it, that is, there is no condition to terminate, loops end only when we have some condition given here.
Our loop has to run only till this point. Okay, so this will also be an infa loop. Let's move ahead. It is written here that int aa while aa = 10 buckets, which is the entire body of our while loop. Our limit of while is from here to here. Look, bracket bracket. Okay, while i = 10. Again an equal to is written. So let's go line by line. The value of i is box nothing. Box is not created. Value is not entered. Now it is written i = 10.I have put 10, okay, as long as the value of i is 10 and now it is 10, as long as i is given 10, that is, it is written here print f b n i. Okay, so it comes directly to the output. When we are talking about printing, if n is put, then i will be printed on the next line. If i is printed, then 10 will be printed. i = i + 1, so the value of i has become 11. Okay, the value of i has become 11, but coming back here, we will come back here.E equal to 10 is not equal to two is equal to two so here we put the assigned value back to 10 and always again we will keep going inside the loop and keep printing 10 only then our output will be 10 10 10 this will never end again resulting in infa loop okay so keep in mind whenever such things happen then infa loop type of type becomes our unless end.Till we have any break condition inside, okay let's move ahead friend, let's move to the next question, the next question has been given to us, predict the output, again in the main function we have written int x = 4 y = 0 z, then oneThen mine is bigger than row, of course, go inside and let's do one thing, we mark the block of weil also, this is the curly bracket and the other one here, so this is complete my block of weil, let's mark it once, okay, very good, okay brother, now it is written here, is one greater than zero, four, go ahead exactly, one minus minus one minus minus means if x is less than one, then the value of x becomes three, go ahead.Increase this print is not being printed, so it would not have made any difference if this had also been written in its place because it is not being used anywhere. Right now only one is written. Okay, y Ps Pw is increased by two. Let's proceed from x. If x = equal y IsWe will write else print a base sl a percentage d percentage dIt will be 31 and z, our initial is kept like this, but z has no use here, so it will get garbage value because it has not given any work, so for now any garbage value, I am denoting it with g, it will get a strange number, okay and both of these will be printed like this, what is your class work, print it once and see, it is a very simple question, let's go ahead friend, predict theOutput: This is kind of the same question, I believe, all is right, so this is your homework, this is a good question, not good, it is very simple, in the end, maybe you don't think too much in this question, again it will be a very simple question, it is the same, see, almost the same question, okay brother, so let's move ahead now friend, some basics of almost for loop and while loop.If we have read, then we will start some questions, but before that, we will start the questions on operators, but before that, it is necessary to have a do while loop here. Do while loop was my miss, now I had told about do while loop, this is a useless thing, why do you see what is a do while loop, like if we have a while loop, then the while loop runs according to the condition, but if you have a do while loop, then the thing that always happens once in the do while loop.It will work, it will work, it's fine for me, whether our condition is getting true or not, like what happens in the while loop, the while condition is fine and here was our code, okay, here I used to write i ps late and give some value.
So I enter this and if this condition is not true then the loop of course will not run, it will run only till the condition remains true while what happens in the do while loop, here first of all we write do then curly bracket curly bracket inside the code just look like do like it is not there in else, similarly here the code is not there any condition then next to this I write similarly while without anything and whatever we get hereBut whatever is written, actually this is a variable, the condition inside a while loop basically has the syntax of do while loop, do is okay, whatever is our code inside here and here I write while condition is okay and this semicalculus here also works exactly the same as while loop, absolutely true, there is no difference, again here also above I will write int int i, whatever we write things and increment.All the decrement things will continue to happen here, the only difference is that whenever I write any condition, this thing works for us, okay, that is to say, once, I will show you by doing it here in the code, a small example of do while loop. Again saying that it is not important but just for your exams, I have to do it, okay, so let's write include here, let's write it here.std d a then we write int main function then we write return zero and then we start our code so do while I was telling something about the while loop, like we write while loop first, suppose I write int aa equals 1 ok or else e equals 11 then I write while pay attention here i is lesson 10 or here p10 write that aa's value is 10I am giving and asked here while aa e lesson 10 so here we write print F ok and you can write anything hello right and here if I write here let's say aa plus plus write anything even if I am ok here if I write anything then what is the problem friend in this thing when this code will not run even when I run it nothing will come see this nothing has come just end code why because the value of aa is 10So the first condition itself has failed, meaning 10 lesson is not 10, then nothing of ours is going to work inside the while, nothing of ours is going to work inside the while, it is okay here whereas if instead of this, I write the same code once, I do this, do try to write in the while do, and suppose here P, I am writing the same code print F and here I am writing hello, okay, hello, and here we do an increment, you guys.And then here we write while aa is lesson 10, okay and we have declared aa also, look i is 10, here first I gave 10 to aa, then this do loop happened, so see one task here, now my loop will run once, it is written aa, hello once, it is written, why because what happens is that first of all I went to do, then the code did not see that there is a condition, it has already printed something, after that it saw the condition, then this is the only difference.If I normally do some things here like suppose I give a, the value of one is fine and once we hide the do while loop and run our normal while loop, then you have understood what its code will be i1, then one will be printed, two print three print four will go till i9, mine will write hello nine times. If you want, I can show you here by doing it, let's give it like this, okay look, I will run it and hello will come again.Ha Prasa, my problem came only once, let's look at it once, one, two, three, let's see from this, one two, six, six, okay, normal while loop, and if I do the same thing in do while, if I do the same thing in do while, then there will be no difference, but look here, let's see, I run the code of do while, so where did it go, okay, I did not write the back slash here, I am so sorry, so look, the same code has come, is there any difference?No, 1 doti then 4 pa 6 7 89 So usually there is no difference between while and do while loop, just if you have to print it only once like we saw in the previous example of Dval, even if the condition is not hit then it runs once, then Dval is used only for this purpose, rest there is no need to tell anything about it today, let's go ahead, let's come to our important thing which is our Lord.Questions Using Operators Okay, now this thing Maanvi Ma'am has already made you understand many of the questions.
Chances are, your revision will be done but I am also going to add some questions here. You must have got a separate lecture for this. Wright and pattern printing are completely different things, they are going to be completely different but here you will get to learn a lot about what is the actual working of our for loop. Till now we were just studying the basics of loops, so let's start with the questions. Let's start with the very best questions.Which are going to happen through operators, let's move ahead friend, so our first question is write a program to count the digits of a given number, very excellent, very beautiful question, so basically assume that I have been given a number, n is 1 2 3 45, okay, this is my number instead of 1 2 3 4 5, if I write anything, let's say 19325, then the number of digits of anything will beI have to count and tell you what I can see 1 2 3 4 5 I can see clearly but how can the computer recognize it or if I put any input and the computer gives the answer then how will we solve it friend first let me give you a hint friend what is the hint hint here it is going to be that you will have to use the division operator, okay the division operator and the second hint is that if you ever get any numberWhen you divide an integer by 10, an integer is an int data type, in a computer, the last digit is removed, meaning the second hint for our friend here would be that if I divide 19325 by 10, I know the answer, what we get is 193 2. You will not get just that much because it is an integer. If we are talking about computers, then I hope you must have thought a little bit about it. Now I will code it for you, first of all.Let me explain the algorithm that what we will do is going to be very simple, suppose we have taken the input n, this is 19325. Okay, so what we will do is that we will put it in a loop, we will keep dividing it by 10, meaning first of all, I will take another variable called int count in which I will count the digits of that number, like its answer is F and I will initialize it with what is zero, meaning for once in this, we will count.I am wondering how many digits the number has, I am fine, then what will I do, I will keep dividing like first of all, I did 19325 divided by 10, I did okay, that means I will write like this, I n = n diva ba 10, okay, you know the meaning of it, now what will happen in n if n is already in this box of mine, 19325 n = n diva ba 10 means 1932 value is put in n.Okay and then I will make my count plus plus, that means I will increase one number in the count, okay and I will keep doing this work as I divided then look at the count, it is like this 1932 is 5 so first of all I divided by 10, 1932 is left in the count, our one came, then I divided one more time by 10, then the number came to 193, I added one more number to the count, then I went back by 10.Divided 19 left, at the same time here I reduced the count to three, then I again divided by 10. 19 / 10 Our one is 1.9 but one is one more, I added four to the count and divided the last one by 10, then the answer will be zero, I am fine and my answer will be five. Now pay attention, what is the condition of termination here, which means to end the loop, I repeat it again and again.How many times am I going to do this work, like I did it five times here, so you can see that as I keep dividing by 10, how many times do I have to divide by 10, until my number becomes zero, until my number becomes zero, now should I do it with a for loop or should I solve it with a wide loop, you may also be thinking, should I solve it with a for loop or a while loop, so I told you one thing whenIf you don't know much, then you can solve it with the while loop, like here I just have to tell you, what is the condition given to me? The condition is something like this, when my number becomes zero, then I have to end the loop. Apart from this, it means that if any initial condition is not given, then it is given that the value of the number has been given, but int aa and aa have nothing to do with us here. I is the variable that we use.Neither the extra variable nor it has anything to do with it. Okay, and the increment decrement thing. Here let me explain to you what is happening. So when you don't know anything then use the while loop.
So, can't we write the code like this, let me show it by coding, isn't it, it is getting boring, okay, here we create a file inside the loops, what is its name, dot C with the name count digits, okay and here we write everything back as ours, include std dot, then int main, then here we write return zero and write our code, so first of all, suppose I have a number int n and I will take its input from the user.I will write print f enter enter a number then I will go here and take an input from scanf so the percentage d a and n 7n is not coming and n is ok and then now I will run my loop because what do I have to do friend pay attention come back here I first of all have to keep dividing it by 10 again and again as soon as I divide by 10 then add one to the count count e equal to count the first one is plus.Add one, okay or we can also write it as count plus plus, so we know that both these statements will be there but we have to put a loop because it has to happen again and again, I don't know how many times it has to happen because the number is my answer, okay, so here first of all we create an int count, we initialize our int count from zero, now here we are going to use the while loop because what is our condition, let's come back here.What is our condition? The condition should be that we should run the loop until my A is equal to zero.Till then keep dividing and keep writing your code, then I have to write while here I will write n is not equal to 0 unless n is equal to zero so first of all n is divided by 10 and here I will make my count plus plus and at the end I have to print from what digit so here we write na yaar print F print F and here we directly write the digits R the number of digits R percentage.D And here we will count, okay let's run it once, let me explain it to you in a little more detail, so we have run this code, I have written the enter number, so I write T 4 5 6, so this is a five digit number, so look at the number of digits R F, okay, you understand, I run back enter number 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, so this is an eight digit number, so our code is working well.Now once we bring this code here, friend, and of course, dry run, we will do it, right, friend, without dry run, the work is not done, okay, or let's do one work, let's copy this slide, okay, so let us dry run this question. Look, this is a very small code. Okay, there is nothing special in it. No, you will see that it is a code of two to four lines, but all our work is being done in this entire code. Let's see how the work is being done here. Let's assume that we have enteredTake n and let's say the value of my n is 1 2 3 4 so it is a four digit number and first of all I have created an int count here named 'is equal to 0' and let's write a little here and there and inside this we have put the value of zero. Okay, now it is written here, keep running the loop until n is equal to 0, so see what is happening by running the loop, first of all n isThe value is 1 2 3 4 So n = n / 10 So its value becomes 1 2 3 As soon as this happened, we had to keep one more thing in mind here, we write the count in the same way, right now, the value of the count is zero for us, as soon as this happens, put a plus in the count, then the count is equal to count P 1, so we put one in the count, then next here in the count.We put one and then looked at the loop again. If n is 1 2 3 then 1 2 3 is not equal to zero. So run the loop. It is not over yet. Go back and divide by 10 and add. So it becomes 12 and add one more to your count. Okay then see if 12 is equal to zero. No come inside then divide by 10. One is here. Then look here add one more count and add three. Then see is one zero?Otherwise divide it by 10. See the meaning of n = n / 10 and see the original. You n = 1 2 3 4 whatever was 10 is fine, you all should know this.
A. Okay, as n = n + 10 means, similarly we divide by doing n = n / 10. Okay, here we were n = n by 10, so 1 by 10, our zero comes, pay attention in integer and this will become my 4. Now the value of n is zero, so is zero not equal to zero, otherwise we had to run the loop until there was zero, it became zero, our loop is finished, so see.The value of the count is done, we just printed it, it is very simple, I hope you have understood the question because the next question I am going to ask is absolutely based on this, it is absolutely based on this, just a little difference will come here, pay attention to that question, let's move ahead, the question is write a program to print the sum of digits of a given number. Well, like last time I had to tell how many digits a number is, if I had saidI am n = 1 2 3 4 5 so it is a five digit number, now I have to tell the sum of all these, like ours is technically even, our sum will be 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 p 5, that is, you can see that our 15 should be even, so how do I have to print it. If my n is 99998, then I have to show it as 9+ 9+ 9+ 8. So how will I do it?Friend again, for this, first of all I give you a small hint, please try it yourself, friend, we come to our hint section, look at the hint, hint number one is that here now I will also use the modus operator, both the modus operator and division operator, like last time I used the division operator, okay and hint number two is that if we have 1 2 3 4 5, then 1 + 2+ 3+.We can also write 4 + 5 like this 5 P 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 I hope this gives you a little idea of what I am going to do, now think a little and try to code, I hope you must have tried, now I am going to tell you my solution here. Okay, so we have seen the hints, let's see the solution, what do we have to do every time? Again, we know that we have to put a loop.What will we do this time, friend, this time we will take a variable, sum and even the sum will be equalized by zero, okay then we will keep adding to the sum again and again, like sir, first of all, we will start adding it in reverse, like A, we have tooth 4, 5, then what will we do, what will we add inside the sum, will we add a number, which digit will be the last number, okay, if you have given any number, then how do you retrieve its last digit?One thing, we have a question, let's say 1 2 3 4 5 n is given, then how do I store five, that is, how do I take the value of five, so tell me one thing, if I modify 1 2 3 4 5 or any number by 10, then what do I get? I will always get its last digit, always try it, no matter what the number is, I say 998 / 10.So look, 10 * 9 90 is left here, 98, 10, 9, 90. Reminder is 8. So if you divide any number by 10, the answer is the same, which is the last digit. Reminder, that becomes ours. Okay, this is a very obvious thing. If it was 3, 4, 0, it would be completely divisible, so that's why five is our reminder, so this is clear to you here.What will we do if we get a hint? We can take a new variable again and again. We can take it inside the loop itself. Which one? First retrieve the last digit and add it inside the sum. Sum is equal to sum plus which last digit. So we can write this variable like this. We can also create a variable by adding or adding the last digit.As soon as we add, like what we did inside the sum, let's say our n is 1 2 3 4 5. Okay, so we added the fw and as soon as we did, then again we will do one thing here, will bring n back to n / ba 10. Okay, pay attention to this thing and we will put a loop on this whole thing. Now let's see what is right in it, how much is wrong, we will put a loop in this whole thing and the condition is going to remain the same until our number is not.Will remain equal to zero, once here I show algorithm wise what is happening with us, let's see this on another page, let's say my number is 1 2 3 45, so what will I do, first of all, I am denoting this variable by my last digit, LD, the last digit is always mine, what will happen to the number if I take the modus by 10, that is, five is okay last.I got my digit and then I started talking to myself.
Inside m, the sum is our initial 'Y', I write 'Sam', what is mine now, is zero, if it is lying at zero, then inside the sum, I will add 'Sum' is equal to sum plus the last digit. So see now what is the value of 'Sum', the last digit is my 'F', okay for now, see, from here, my last digit becomes 'F', so if I add 'F' inside the sum, then 'F' has come. Okay, now what will happen next, I will keep looping in it again and again but from that.First of all, it is necessary to divide n by 10, why because see, then I would need this digit also, why am I dividing 4 n by 10? See, once I divide n by 10, my n here is 1 2 3 4 5, it becomes 1 2 3 4. Now let's look back once again, this thing will run in my loop, everything is fine, I will take out the last digit by doing n modelo 10, okay.So for now ours is 1 2 3 4. n is modified by 10 so the last digit becomes my four. Now ok then sum is equal to sum plus the last digit sum. What is our 5 so 5 + 4 now my sum becomes 9 and n = n / 10 again this becomes my 1 2 3 I hope you are able to understand all the things what am I saying we will go back to last.On digit then n mudl 10 then 123 mud 10 how much is 3 then value of last digit now becomes three this time sum is equal to sum plus last digit sum our 9 is 9 + 3 becomes 12 and n is n / 10 again we divide n by 10 and so on all these things will continue one more time let me show last digit isEqual to n mod 10 then 12 mod 10 divide 12 by 10 a reminder will come two sum is equal to two sum plus last digit then 12 + 2 14 Okay so here the sum also becomes mine 14 n = n / 10 n becomes 1 Now let's come back to the last digit equal to 1 mod 10 1 mudd would be 10If my one is one then the value of the last digit becomes mine one then back to sum is equal to current sum i.e. 14 plus last digit is my one then it becomes 15 then the value of the sum becomes my 15 and my n = n module n then n becomes my zero as soon as n becomes zero I have to end the loop so again my code is going to be similar to this, let's do it quickly and we will do this in ourLet's copy the code because almost our code is going to remain like this. Okay, let's go inside the loops. What was its name? A sum of digits. Sum of digits dot C. Okay and let's copy paste it here for once. Look, I took a number as input. I said enter a number. Same scanf is the normal thing. Instead of count, I write sum here. Okay, sum is our zero. Same while i y is the same, I mean the same while n is not.Equal to 0 and then we remove these conditions, look at their order, look carefully, what is the first thing we have to do, friend, we have to bring a new variable by doing the last digit, now we will initialize it anywhere, now here we will write the last digit, capitalize it D, once it is ok, what will be the value of the last digit, friend, I had said n modelo 10, so n modelo is 10 last digit.Now the value is done, what is the new value of the sum? Sum is equal to sum plus how much is our last digit here, so look at the last digit and then n in n div ba 10, so three things are happening here, okay, model 10 is also being used, this is also being used and then of course we write the sum. We write the sum of digits is the sum. Okay, so let's run this code once and see enter a number 1 2.3 4 So our sum should be 10 So look the sum of digits is 10 Okay let's run it once again here let's write 9999 So our sum should be 36 So look the sum of digits is 36 So it is working I hope you have understood this code This is your homework, now it is class work Actually you can dry run it and see for yourself There are many similar questions.What I am going to do in the next question, isn't it friend, it is very terrible, it is a very good question, that question is our friend, I have given good homework, never mind, let's do the terrible question later, first of all you look at your homework, solving it yourself is the homework, our write a program to print the sum of all the even digits of a given number, meaning if I have been given n 1 2 3 4 5, then my sum should be which is myWhat you have to print will be 2 + 4 i.e. only six. Now think for yourself how to do it. What is the hint? What is your hint? It is the same here. Use the same code which I just gave you the code. It is going to be exactly the same code here but.
Now, when you are adding to the sum, you just have to put one if condition, which one, now you have to think for yourself, okay, apply the if condition and add your sum, okay, write another homework, friend, take out the sum of all the odd digits too, so come on, friend, let's solve this terrible question of ours. What has been asked from us in the question, that is, write a program to print the reverse of a given number, okay and store it.Let's add it to the question and store the number. It means that if suppose I have given number T 3 4 5, then I have to make a reverse number 5 4321 and then print it, then how will I do this question, friend, this is a very, very good question, it makes the person think a little about what we will do, so first I give you a hint, it is necessary to give a hint, I want you guys to solve it, okay.Okay, so look what is the first hint friend that the two questions you just did are based on the two questions you did, the same meaning is going to remain the same while loop, n is not equal to 0, okay and we will keep dividing A, we also know that we are going to use the last digit also, it is okay, the two questions we just did are the second thing that is going to remain here, what do we say?The hint is that the hint is going to remain the same, friend, whatever number we have, we have to pick the last digit, then what will we do with it, friend, we will multiply it by 10, so here I will write the hint to multiply by 10, I hope you will be understanding some things friend, how to do it, now once I write the algorithm in front of you, then you try to solve it again, it is okay, I would put the hints below.Okay, after making some space, now I try to write the algorithm. Algorithm means how can this thing be done, okay of course, I will put all the things in a loop, so accept whatever is my while loop, okay, the while loop has come, my condition is the same that my n should be greater than zero, till then my loop will continue but I will talk about thinking inside the loop, so how to do it, so let's do it in a slightly different way, okay we can do one thing.Look very carefully, what am I going to do, I write here n, how much we have right now, 1 2 3 4 5, let's make n a little smaller, 1 2 3 4, and again it will be the other way around, 4321, okay, I am doing this, it will be a little less, but the point is the same and what is my reverse number, right now I don't know, okay for once, I will initialize the reverse number with zeros, okay, I am making a code.I am creating a number int r = 0 and for now my n is 1 2 3 4 Now see what I will do one by one first of all I can do one thing is that in r I can add four okay of course I mean from the last digit so in r I added four okay so r becomes one so my here on four four second thing as I added in four so now my because n is second lastIf you need a digit, okay, then I will divide it by 10, so it becomes 123. Okay, now the second thing, now I need r, which is 4321, so for one turn, let us concentrate on how I can make r 43. How can I make 43, tell me one thing, 43 is 40 π 3, which is my 4 * 10 π 3, so I cannot add this 3 just like that.I will do this, then it will be the sum of digits, which I have done, I will do one thing, first I will make this four, okay, first I will make four, my 40, then I will add its last digit to it, here I will make it 43, again I will divide n by 10 and make it 12, okay now again 43, I have r, now let's try to make r 432, okayHow to make 432? 432 is 430 + 2. Okay, it is 43 * 10 + 2. So again my first task will be to multiply it by 10, I have become 430, then I will add its last digit to it, then it will become 432 and again by dividing it by 10, I will make it one. Again, I have 432 lying with me, I have 43 2.If I want 1 then I can write it 4320 + 1 then multiply 432 by 10 and add one to it. Then again I will multiply this by 10. 4320 and I will add this digit to it which will become 4 3 2. I will divide 1 by 1. So here I will be left with 10. Sorry, 10 will be left with me.
I have zero and as soon as it becomes zero, then the condition is over, then you are getting the understanding from here that which steps are we following. First of all, friend, we are adding in aa, is the last digit okay, so I can say that in aa, I am adding the last digit, we know how to find it, meaning instead of the last digit, we can also write this, all the time, n is 10, okay.Here we said that when we did this work, we got four but we have to multiply it by 10 also, so we will keep r by multiplying it by 10. Okay, then we will divide our n also by 10. And according to me, if I repeat this thing, this particular process, I will repeat it, that is, in a loop.So our work should be done because we have seen that it will be done. Okay friend, let's check. Let's see if there are any problems in this code or no problems. First of all, let's solve this code and our condition is going to be this. We will do this till my n becomes equal to zero, then the condition is going to be that our n should be greater than zero or else we will write.We can do n is not equal to 0. Okay, so this time let's make n greater than 0 and create our code. Write the reverse number DC here and paste the same code here too. First of all, we have taken a number, taken input, everything is done. Now instead of int sum, we write int reverse. It will be reversed by r. So we can always use the last digit, there is no big deal in it, this time let's do one thing, don't use it.It's simple, we can use n model 10, okay, so what is the condition inside the code, my condition is the same, while n is not equal to 0, this time I am writing it like this, greater than 0, the same thing, okay, what did I have to do, if I look back in my pen copy, I have written, first of all, I will add r as I saw, n will add 10 to ya, which means the last digit.I will add it, okay, so r = r ps last digit and we know that our last digit is always this, so I can also write this directly, I do not need to create a new variable, okay then what I do is I will multiply r by 10 also, man, r has to be multiplied by 10 also, why because next time I will add some things like here when my r was four, then I will not add three to four.If I add three to 40, then every time I will have to multiply by 10 so that that place comes on the units digit and in the last I will divide n by n. This code most probably has a very small mistake in it. We will see that small mistake, okay here we write the reverse number is r, okay, I have not done anything, in this new r I am storing not my reverse number and in the last I am printing it.Okay, I will make the original number my zero at the end, so let's run it, see some error is coming, undeclared identification output, the reverse number is 43210, why is it like this, no one, let's run it one more time, we write enter number 999, what do you say, so the number should come 6999, so if we press enter, then it is 6999 0, then why is one zero extra unnecessarily, man, amazing.It's a matter of friend, in this code, have we made a mistake that our zero extra is coming of course? How can we avoid this? At the end, if my reverse number is having a zero extra, then we can write here r e r ba 10. Okay, once we write it, the work should be done. Run the code, we write t 3 4, so only 4321 is coming, but why should we do this, okay, nothing can be done without this, so once.Let's dry run this question and let me explain where we made a small mistake. Okay, we just made a mistake in the order. Okay, we didn't face much problem here. We just made a mistake in our little else. Okay, here is our big code. Come on brother, let's look at it. Let's dry run this code. Dry run it in your pen copy. You will also dry run it. Okay, let's see what mistakes are coming, then agree.I will take the value of n.
Take Lee Tooth 4 Okay so let's go to this code and reverse number my aa is zero for now look here zero is here as long as n is greater than zero of course n is greater than zero for now then aa = aa p a modle 10 r equal to aa which is currently my aa what is zero so what is r e 0 plus n 1 2 3 4 modus 10 1 2 3 4Model 10 is 4. If you modify any number by 10 then it goes to the last digit then r = 0 p 4 so one four is stored inside aa. Okay let's move ahead r = 4 is 4. Now r * 10 so it is also multiplied by 10 r so r becomes my 40 then ours comes n = n which is 1 2 3 4 / 10 so1 2 3 Value of n is done 1 2 3 Okay brother, it is very good, let us do one thing, write the value of n and the value of r in separate lines, now n is 40 and this is 123, now we go back to the loop 1 2 3 What is the value of n, is it greater than zero, go exactly inside the loop r = r + n mud 10 so r = eNow current r is mine 40 + n mdl 10 so r 3 mdl 10 ok that will be my 40 p 13 mdl 10 is 3 i.e. 43 so my value is stored inside aa now 43 then r = r multiply these 10 aa further by 10 and further divide n by 10 friend so n becomes 12 go back in the loop.Is 12 greater than zero? Yes, of course. So this is my pho p 2, so the value of r becomes 432. Then I multiplied r by 10, here it becomes 4320. Then I divided my n by 10, so n becomes mine. From here n, now go back. Is one greater than zero? Go inside exactly. r = r प n.Mud 10 then add 1 mud 10 to 4320 so that is only one so one is added to 4320 so it becomes 432 1 then r e r * 10 Problem 43 210 n = n ba 10 Now the value of n is zero.You can fix the code like I told you how after the loop ends in the code, if I like when the loop ends, after this we can write simple because there is only one zero extra, then divide r by 10, we can do this work off course, here it is okay, this will do a very good job, but apart from this, do we have any other work around, I say, we have a small work around, if I replace this with thisOkay, that is, look here in the code, we come into the code, remove the line with r = r and 10 by using commandIn the beginning there was zero, so 0 * 10 is coming out first, so it is remaining zero, okay, so one zero is left for us, always the rest, you complete it once yourself, like I have brought this code here, now we have to swap both of them, just swap these two lines, we have to write one above the other, one below the other, our code will be absolutely correct. Let's move towards the next question. Write a program homework to print the sum of the given.Number and its reverse, think for yourself, I am not going to give you any hint in this, what I have to do is just assume my number is n 1 2 3 4 and the code to get my reverse number, we have seen it, copy paste the same code, first of all, 4321, then I have to print the sum of these two i.e. 3 4 p 4321, basically what I have to do is 5 5 55, which is its sum or whatever, I have to print the sum and show it now.Think about it yourself, I am not going to give any hint here, I have to add one little thing, just move ahead to the next question print the sum of this series 1 -2 p 3 - 4 p 5-6 up to n, we are going to solve this in two ways, first of all, my method one and method one, what can I give you just a little hint, friend, this is a very simple question, is it a very simple question?You just have to use loop and if else, you are fine, this is a hint, now try it yourself, I hope you must have tried, this is a very simple question, let's solve it, first thing, what have you given me, up to n, up to n terms, basically these are the terms, friend, I don't know whether n will be preceded by plus or minus, what is meant to say is assume that the value of n is a.
If it is sane then what do I have to do? One -2 + 3 -4 + 5 -6 + 7 So I have to find out the answer and print it. Suppose if the value of n was 4 then I have to do 1 - 2 + 3 - 4. So see in the last our minus can also come plus can also come in that eighth term so one thing is clear that our number of terms is number of terms so here we have n. Okay ifAll you are asked is that you have to find this sum: 1 P 2 P 3 P 4 up to end terms, this is the sum of normal A, so you can do this very easily, how to put a for loop, keep adding to the sum, see, we do it, okay, let's just write it here, let's create a new file by doing sum of series dot C and write all our things here, copy paste it again, I am not, okay, we copy paste a basic code.Okay, let's write here and usually we delete all the things. Okay, so what have we done? Again, I have to take the input of one number, I have to do another number and enter the number, all the things are done, now I just have to find the sum, so the first question we ask is that if suppose I have to find this 1 P 2 P 3 P 4 then plus up to end terms, okay up to end terms, I have to find the sum of the for loop.By using or by using any loop, our code is going to be very simple. First of all, create a sum variable inside which you will store that number in the sum, then you will put your for loop, then write the for here, start with int i = 1, take care, go to i < = n and i ps, you don't have to do anything, you have to add the variable every time inside the sum, that's the end, ok and then print the sum.Do it, it has not become so simple, it has become very simple, here it is okay, the sum is not the sum of the digits but the sum is the whole, so once we print it and see, the sum is here, the percentage is D and the comma is the sum, so let's run this code. First of all, we are doing the basic question, then we will do the good one. Run the code. If I give n as 5, then the answer should be 15. Look, 1+ 2+ 3+ 4+ 5.15 is similar to 1 to A terms, I have come up with the sum and I will not even do a dry run of it. It is very simple. Now what do we have to change, if instead of this we just have to do 1 - 2 p 3 minus f. Okay, then here plus 5 minus sps and so on. So it is a very simple thing. Look at the observation here, what is my observation that all the odd numbers are there.Okay, they are being added and all our even numbers are being subtracted. Okay, even numbers are being subtracted. From the total sum, like our sum is -2, that is, -1 + 3, that is, 2 2 - 4. Do you understand that this is how our answer is going to be here, okay, so whatever it is, we can do one thing. Let's use the FL statement here. Let's end the story.Friend, don't do this directly, let us remove it. Now, all the odd numbers we have, if i is an odd number, then the odd number is this. If it is not divisible by two, then it is not divisible by two. Not equal to zero is ours anytime. If this is happening, then what do you have to do? Friend, if there is an odd number inside the even number, then you have to add sum ps aa and if there is an even number, then you write if aa mud.2 equ equ 0 So I have to subtract that from the even number. Sum minus a is okay. That even number has to be minus. Okay, sum is minus a. Here P again here you can also write this else. It is not needed because it is either even or odd. Okay, so by doing this our answer will come exactly. Let's run it once and see. I put the number seven, the answer is four. Is it really four? Let's try.Friend, this is what I have to do, what do I have to do, friend, I have to do 1 - 2 then P 3 then -4 + 5 -6 P 7 Ok so I have to do Y so let's add and see E is equal to 1 - 2 How much is our love -1 -1 P 3 is our 2 2 - 4 How much is my love 2 - 4 Either do one thing add all the things and do all the subcutsSo we can write it like this, it's simple maths, let's say none 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 and then -2 - 4 - 6 so look 1 + 3 4 4+ 5 9 9 + 7 is our 16 16 minus how much is ours 16 - 2 is our 14 14 - 4 is how much is our 10 10 - 6 is how much is our 4 Okay so ourAnswer: Ofcourse, only four is coming here, ok, how do you want, you try it, ofcourse, this thing is true, I hope you like this code.
You must have understood, it was a very simple code but it is a bit taxing for the computer. Look here what does this code mean. Suppose our A is 1000. Okay, if A is my Haj, then what is happening if A is 1000, then my loop will take Haj iteration. See if n is 1000 then let's say that is our for loop or whatever the loop is, the loop will run 1000 times meaning 1000.There will be 1000 rounds of iterations, this is a very big number, so it will take a lot of time, for computers it can be done quickly but it will take time, if I tell you it has a simple formula like when we were doing 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 up to n through for loop, then was it not needed, why because 1 + 2 + 3, see here what is its direct answer, 1 + 2 up toThe answer of n is n * n + 1 up 2. We have read these things in AP sum and 10th class maths, so why not do one thing. We also make a formula like 1 -2 - 3 - 4 - 5 -6. We can make it a formula very easily. The answer will come in two different cases. How, let's see this thing, okay, let's see here, let's assume thatWhat are our two cases? Either our n will be even or our n will be odd. Well, if n is even then our n is even. So in that case, suppose we have to print the numbers from one to 6. Then divide them into groups 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 and 5 - 6. Well, if six is the number then it will be divided into three groups. Two is the basis of two. It is a simple thing, the number is divided into half of the number and so on.You know the answer: 1 - 2 is -1, 3 - 4 is also -1, 5 - 6 is also -1, so tell me one thing, how many times is this three times, that is, whatever number is my n byte times, if I add -1, then what will be my direct answer, friend - n ba 2, so anytime, if my n is even, then I can directly print my answer - n2, so let's see, friend.How will we solve the sum of our series by method number two? If it is okay then let's take the same question here. Our two different formulas are based on different cases. Look at what I mean. Let me try to explain something to you. Whenever we have an even number of terms, let's say 1 -2 + 3 -4 + 5 -6 + 7 -8 is okay. So what is the number of terms here n my.It is equal to eight. In this case, we divide it into groups. It can always be divided into groups of two. Look, it is divided into this group, into this group, and in this group, so clearly, I can write this as -1 plus I can write this also as -1. Then this will also become my -1. 5 - 6. You see what I am saying. 7 - 8 will also become -1, so at the end my answer will become -4. Now notice how many times this is -1, four times and what is four?It is 8/2, so here is our direct formula. Now if you want, you can assume it instead of 8. If it was not n = 6, then all these things would have happened, then our answer would have been -3. Okay, if n = 10, the answer would have been -5. So you have evaluated a formula that if my n is even or you can write directly if n is equal to 2 equal to 0, that is, it is even.My code can be directly said in this case which is my even, the value of even is - n ba 2. Okay why brother you can see if there is eight then always -4 answer will come n = 10 I will take -5 answer will come see here 9 - 10 then this one and -1 will come. If you understand then pairs of two are being formed because this is a very simple thing. You must have understood then directly I can write if n is even then the answer is this.Think, when there was a question of for loop, friend, all the things had to be done by putting a loop in it, the loop was run that many times, now the direct answer will come in one stroke, there will be no need for rounds in one turn, there will be no need for iteration, we call it a very efficient code, we are fine with it because if our number becomes very big, then it is very simple for that, suppose their value is 1 lakh, if it is fine, then running the loop one lakh times is better than direct.The answer will come in a second, isn't there a difference between the two? Now here friend, this is only for even number of terms. If I say for odd number of terms, then a difference will come like suppose if n is odd then it is ok or we can write it as if n and 2 is not equal to 0, basically this will also come in the condition of our else. If it is not even then here I am an example in front of you.Let us assume the value of n to be 7 then it will be 1 -2 + 3 - 4
+ 5 - 6 + 7 So in terms of odd numbers, we will not be able to make all the pairs, one number will be left alone, meaning if I try to make a pair from back, then what will be the difference, one pair is left for us, so let's try to evaluate once what answer will come, this will always give -1 to me, this will always give -1, this will also give -1, okay and it will give only 1000s, so notice that from back it has become -3.Keep Se aside for now, I am keeping it aside for once, I am not adding it, why is it like this? Pay attention to how many pairs are being formed. In the case of '6', only three pairs are being formed. In the case of '7', only three pairs will be formed. One is our only lone pair, which is called this, it will be left alone. Ours is fine, but what is amazing is that in computers, 7 divided by 2 is also 3. Int is right in int, so if our n is 7.If n is 7 then clear n batu then mine will be 3 only then can I write this here look at -3 I can write this - n batu yes and 7 then my n is only n then our formula becomes this For odd number of terms - n ba 2 p n this will always be there Suppose if I had 7 - 8 + 9 n = 9 then this would also become a pair this would give -1 and this would give 9Again 9/2 4 4 times -1 is coming, ok this will always be true but keep in mind that like in mathematics, don't write this as - n + 2 + n as n + n + 2, it will be wrong because this - n / 2 is not 3.5 yet, it will become 3, so we will have to write it like this - Sum = - n / 2 + n In this way, you will have to write plus n / 2, it will give a different answer, he will give me the answer.Do you understand what I am saying? If I directly write n / 2 instead of this, then the answer will be wrong because my answer is not th, my answer is 4 - 3 + 7. Okay, let's code it once and let me explain to you, what I want to say is that we have put such a big pay for loop here, it is not needed, let's remove it. Simply check, is my n divisible by two? If so, then brother, it is simple.What do you do in the sum, friend, let us write here the value of our sum will be - n ba 2 simple answer will come and later if you print it then - n ba 2 is ok brother it is over otherwise else if my number is odd then the value of the sum will come in the even - n ba 2 will definitely come one is fine then plus one will be n separately and of course bud mass will be calculated so this thing is going to be calculated first friend after that it will be added.So, there is no need to put brackets in it, let's see once also, the answer will be the same. If I try seven, suppose I do nine, then my answer should be how many fives. If I did the previous code, the same would come. If I do seven, the answer would be four. In the previous code also four was coming, so of course, this is a better code for the computer. If n comes big, then we can do it directly without the for loop. Okay, let's move ahead, friend.Let's solve the next question, this is a very very important question, I am putting a star, so it is okay here, it is going to be very useful in the future, that means it will build your foundation, there will be many of our RK medium level questions, there will be easy level questions which you learn from this, if it is okay, then it does a basic form, if it is doing a basic form, then the question is print the factorial of a given number, okay.If you have taken maths in 11 12 then you know the meaning of factorial. Okay, if you did not take maths in 11 12, then let me tell you the meaning of factorial right now. It is not a big deal. Okay, factorial is basically. Suppose I say 5 factorial, then its value is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. Now you must be thinking, what have I written, it is okay, so sometimes I write.Exclamation mark: If I write n then there is exclamation mark in English, it means this is pronounced as n factorial and this is a shortcut to write n. What is the basic meaning of factorial? If I say 5 factorial then its meaning is 5 * 4 * 3. Multiply it up to 1. I mean anytime I say 10 factorial then you must have understood its answer.10 10 * 9 * 8 keep reducing one number by one in 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ok what does n factorial mean friend n * n a smaller number than n -1 whatever it will be I don't know then n-2 up to so on will keep multiplying till one ok of course factorial a
For Bhi, you assume that this is just defined. For natural numbers, our meaning is for whole numbers. Well, it means 1 factorial, 2 factorial, 3 factorial. It would not be that 2.5 is 5 factorial. Okay, for now, don't consider it. Well, there is one more thing for us. Here, 0 factorial is also my one. Now why does this happen, you don't have to pay attention to this thing, it's okay, this permutation.The concept of combination is that if we do not select anything then there is a way but anyway it is ok 0 factorial is our one just remember it S True like if I say power of a is 0 and 0 is factorial one 1 factorial is also my one 2 factorial you can take out 2 * 1 2 is 3 pho is 3 * 2 * 1 i.e. 6 and so on like thisMeaning, basically any factorial can be generated. We have to tell a program that I give the input number n and I get the answer. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, so 5 * 4 20 20 * 3 60 * 2 120, so 120 should give me the answer of the computer. So how will we write its code, it is very simple, by the way, you can get aPause the video a few times and think for yourself. I hope you have thought about it. Now here, friend, I write the algorithm here and build it into it. You don't have to do anything, you just have to declare a variable. Let's store its factorial inThis is just a product. n factorial means from five to one. It is a product from n to one. So you create a variable named int product. Okay, just like you were making int sum. Since then, create a variable named int product and multiply it by one. Why do you have to do it from one. I know the sum. Okay, if I had to find the sum of 5 p 4 p 3+ 2 p 1, then what would you do. You would put a loop and keep adding a again and again.Now I just have to do the same work, I have to keep multiplying, what does it mean if my product is already one, if I put a for loop where from aa till n till aa ev till lane is equal to n where our number is going and in every iteration of the loop in every round what should I just write my product multiply inside the product product e is equal to product into whatever is our aa like aa will be our one first then 1 nav then eight.1 * 2 product is done, then multiply it by 1. This is what happens. Look, I can write 5 factorials like this too. 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5. You can write it as per your wish, it is the same thing for both of them. It is ok that you are understanding it very well, so let's do this thing, friend and I hope you have understood the code. It is a very simple code, it is ok, so let's make factorial code here, then factorial.Dot C and here we write all the things again or come here, right, a lot of things, so we can copy and paste, why do we write our code again and again, okay, so see friend, first of all, what we have to do is here because we have to find the factorial, so I took a number n, okay, then I wrote enter a number again, then I took the input, I made a variable in it with the name of product because it is a product and did not initialize it with zero, zero.I will always answer zero. Think about it yourself. This is your homework. I initialized it from one and here we can just do it. Off course the factorial is okay. By doing this we can remove this thing and of course we run our loop. What do we have to remove again? What do we need to remove int? It is not inline. Int a = 1. Let's take n and a x p. Okay, you don't have to do anything. You just have to write this product once.Equal to product multiply by a ok let's see what we need to find out, if suppose we have 5 factorial let's say 5 factorial then its value is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 also you can write ok it is your wish if it is ok then 1 neither 2 * 3 nor 4 nor 5 ok and so on so on So you must have understood what is going to happen in the loop once let's run it let's see the code I ran.Why did the error come? Friend, I have initialized the sum somewhere. Here the sum is written. Look brother, I have to print my product, so run it.
Here it is asking enter number, I say F 120, answer will come, see 120 has come, then I do enter number four, 24 should come, answer 24 has come, then I do enter number six, 720 should come, answer 720 has come, it is working absolutely fine, I am saying enter number 10, answer has come 362 8880, what a big answer is coming, from one to onlyI multiplied by 10, it became a very big number, still okay, so friend, this is our factorial, I hope you are understanding this, once we dry run it so that you can get more clarity, it is not needed but still just for you guys, once we dry run it, this part is enough from here, later we have just printed it. Okay, so friend, look at this code once here.Let's go one by one what is happening, my product right now is one, here we write the values of the product, so my product is one for now and the value of my i is also one for now, okay here we go inside the loop for n i = 1 i < = n n let's say mine is my friend f or our five is yes okay so is one less than my five just ahead go inside the loop product is equal to product is equal to current product myOne is into come what is i also mine is also one so the value of the product is now one so one is stored back in it cut one is stored but only one is stored then my i + p so the value of i becomes my 2 ok then we move ahead i = 1 i < n is 2 n less than 5 exactly man go ahead inside so product is equal to current product value is my one and value of i is my twoNow instead of product, 2 is stored, the value of the product is 1 * 2, so here we have our 2, then i is also our look at 1, it has become th, then see if 3 is less than 5, go ahead here, then our product is equal to the current value of the product is 2 * i, the value of 3, so the value of the product has become 6, notice this has become the product, 6, then i has become p i.4 Is 4 smaller than 5? It's true. Go inside. Product is equal to current product. Value of i is 6. Value of i is my four. Okay, so 6 * 4. How much is ours. 24 is stored in place of product. So write here 24. Then we have i. Plus i as it gets bigger, value of i becomes the last fi. Now checked whether fi is less than fi or five. Yes, but after this the loop ends.If it becomes i6 then the value of the product is the current product is 24 and these 5 are 120 so the product is stored in place of 120 and i is plus i is the value of i is g then move ahead i 6 lane equal 5 no loop over finished product our finally 120 is stored in it we got it printed simple dry run let's move ahead and do the next question this is your homework this is a very good questionI am going to give you a little idea and hint about it. Print the factorials of first a numbers means friend, suppose my n is 5, then I have to print it and show it line by line. Look, you have to print how much is the factorial of n, friend, there is only one, factorial of n is 2 n, that is, 2, so you have to show t, factorial of 3 is friend, our 3 * 2 * 1, so you have to print this.You also have to print the factorial of 3, then the factorial of 4. You have to print 4 * 3 in 2, that's right, f is equal to 24 and then you have to print the factorial of 5, 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 e 120. If n is 5, then if n is 10, then you have to print the factorials of all, so essentially you have to show this on the output screen, like this 6 24120 720 And so on, all the factorials have to be printed as far as I have given n, okay, so how to do this, friend, think about it, I mean, will I run the same code again and again, that is, there is one way to do it, which you don't do, that is, nested loops are okay, like nested false, we will also read nested loops, specifically what are we going to read when the next video which is going to come, our very nice pattern printing, okay?If we will study this thing in pattern printing, then here, how will we solve this code, then there is a way to solve our nested loop, but we will see later, now look at an amazing thing, there is a property in factorials, what is the property?
You are not a student of K, keep this aside, pay attention, the amazing thing is that what was 3 pht actually 3 * this thing and this thing, it is this, okay, you understand my point, pay attention to me, 4 = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, whereas 3 * 2 * 1, so it is 3 pht, so can I write that 4 = 4 * 3, similarly I can write 5 pht = 5 * 4 pht, do you understand?Yes, my point is, I can write 6 ft = 6 * 5 ft because 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. Okay, so essentially, if I ever have to calculate 6 factorial, then what will I do? 6 ft = 6 * 5 5 = 5 * 4 4 * 3. Now it is a simple thing, friend, 3 ft is our 3 * 2 ft, so look at it like this, 3 * 2.Let me quickly explain, okay, our 2 factorial is 2 * 1 factorial, 2 * 1 factorial and 1 factorial is nothing, it is only one, so look, our 1 factorial is only one, only okay, so tell me one thing, we just have to print all these things, what is happening at every step, let's come to this code, once here, if you have paid attention a little carefully, when I was dry running this code, then the value of the first product of mine was one.Look again, my value became one, then the value became two, then the value after the cut became six, then it became 24, then 120, so the value of the product was getting some factorial all the time. Listen back to this thing, the value of the product was one. First of all, the value of the product went back to one, then i = 2, then the value of the product became two. Look, after i = 3, the value of the product became 6s. Value of the product at i = 4.It became 24, at i = 5 the value of the product became 120, so the value is coming again and again but I am just not printing it. Okay, so if I print my product here in the code, if I print it here only then there will be no problem. No, see what I want to say, what do I want to do, do nothing. What I have written here is a statement like print F, cut it and write it once here, let's see if it works.Well, suppose I have written here the factorial is this and I also put an enter again and again, our two is going to be printed because okay, so see what happened here, the value of the product is one, so I went to i1, first of all, the product is equal to 1 * 1 one, then print F, the factorial is one, the factorial of one is one, okay, we went ahead, then our two will be printed, let's see this code.Enter a number, I say five, then see 1 2 6 24 120, everyone's factorials are printed, let's move ahead, write here enter number six 1 2 24 120 120, okay, 720, sorry, now here factorial has been written again and again, once let us assume that we have to write this number in the code, like the factorial of five is this, then simply you can do one thing.You can play on the value of key, look at the factorial of percentage d is percentage d and here we can bring the first aa as comma product. You are understanding this percentage d, this is denoting this aa and this percentage d is denoting my product. Let's run this code once and see, back I write 6 then look at the factorial of w is w and the two is 3 e 6 4 e 24.5 is 120 6 is 720 So how simple was the code? There was no difference in it. No dear, I had given you this homework, but I still tried to show it to you. Let's write it here. This is done in the lecture. Okay, but I am not going to show it by dry running it. Dry run it once yourself. This is your homework to know how this code is running. After all, it's okay. How is this code running? I didn't do much, that's it, here I am.Made some changes because our code was changing again and again. Let's move ahead quickly, let's solve the next question. This is an even more dangerous question. For now, I am giving it a double star. This is one of the best questions that we are doing till now. Which one is print the number of the eighth fina? Before this, many children may know this phoney term, but many may not know that.What is the end result of FINA, okay, so let me tell you, there is a series of Fona, it is very famous in mathematics and in the whole world, this series is very famous, I will teach you how this series is formed in two minutes, first of all, you write one, then you write one, okay, these two times you write one, now what will you do with the next term series, like the first term, second third, which will be the next term.
What will it be? The sum of these two is 1 + 1. 2 So write here 2. Now it is 1 + 2. 3 So write here friend. Now 2 + 3. 5 If you are understanding then write here 5. 3 + 5 is 8. Write here 8. Then 5 + 8 is my 13. Write here friend. 13 Then 8 + 13 is 21. So write here.21 13 + 21 How much is our 34, write here 34, then your 21 + 34 is 55, 55, then 34 + 55 is our 89, so write here 89 and so on. You understand what I am saying. Till here, all the terms are there, meaning you just have to write one in the beginning, then the sum of these two is this, then the sum of these two is this, 2 + 3 is 5.3 + 5 8 5 + 8 13 13 + 8 What is it called 21 21 P 13 34 And so on So like this you can normally make the series manually but like if I say which term is this, this is my first term, this is the second term, this is the third term, this is the fourth term, this is the fifth term, this is the sixth, this is seven, this is no, this is 10, this is11 and so on, now like how much will be the 12th term of this series, we will have to do the sum of these two, suppose you are asked directly or someone asks you that friend, tell me 15 terms, what will be of this series, then will you keep calculating like this, if someone asks you, what will be the 100 term of this series, then of course you will make a code for it, which is what we are doing here, then how will we do this, friend, we will find some pattern.What is going on here is the pattern. So we have seen what is going on. The pattern here is that any term is equal to the sum of these two terms, meaning if I pick up the A term, suppose I want the eighth term. Okay, the eighth term, then what will be the value of the eighth term? The sum of the two terms before that is 8 + 13 = 21, so we can write this as sixth term or seventh term plus.The sixth term is anything like this, the two previous terms are fine, the sum of these two is always valid. 89 = this plus this. If you add these two then you will get the acceptance. Like this is valid here also 2 = 1 + 1, but we have to assume that our first term is one and the second term is also one. We have to take this thing with us, it is fine, so how to calculate it, friend, but how do we calculate the last term of our final term?Look, think here, I want you to think a little, of course, we are going to use loops because there is going to be repetition, again and again we see that the value of one is going to be formed by combining two, okay, here we will use loops only, but friend, here I would like to give you a hint, hint number one of mine is going to be that we have to play with two and three variables, okay, I write three variables to make it easier.For this, we will have to play with three variables. What means that last time when I was calculating the factorial of a number, I was keeping the factorial of one number. When I was keeping the sum of series, I had to keep an extra variable along with the I variable which is available in the loop. Here we will have to keep slightly different variables. Pay attention to the fact that by using those variables, we can always update all the things. Okay, let me try to explain to you how II can form my series, I will explain the algorithm a bit here, then try the code yourself, but then I will get the code done myself, very good, tell me one thing friend, what will I take three variables all the time, ABC or AB even, if I take a variable A, I give its value one, I take variable B, I give its value one, and I give a Weble variable, even its value, I give a, P, B, okay and II run a loop in it again and again and later on I will change one more thing, let me explain to you, see if I do something like this, let's bring it here a little, A Eve, we have given the first term because we will have to give Y, we have also given the second term, now I give that the sum will be Aps B, that is, the value of the sum will become my T for one time. Let's write down here, what is the value of A, what is B going to be, what is B going to be, okay?Let's go inside the loop. Let me show you what you have to do inside the loop. I have removed the same value from back. Now see what I am going to do inside the loop. Look very carefully. It is okay to think about this thing. I have made a number a = 1 b = 1. Okay, here I have declared two numbers.
That's my first and second term for now, then I made another variable sum, okay, now I have not given some S's inside the sum, now what I do in the loop, inside the loop, I invert the sum all the time from a p b to sum equal a p b, here I just wrote sum, I write even or sum e 0, first okay, then give a number, I wrote even equal a p b, then I go back to something here.I am going to try to look very carefully what I am going to do, I have made even as A plus B, then I will put B inside my A and put even inside B. Okay, this is how I am playing with the variables, I will try to explain to you, here come to the next page, I hope to make the boxes, I will need Y in front of you, otherwise normally, anyone can explain. Okay, let's say this box is my A. This box is my B. This box is my even.First I put one in A and B. Understand in the sum, I either put zero or nothing, then what I am saying here every time is that friend, I put the value of a and b in the sum. Okay, so a and b are 2. I put two inside the sum. Then what do I do after this, friend, after this either look at the sum, we can print that number, after this we can do one thing that put the value of b inside a, okay a.Remove the value of b and put the value of b and remove the b inside b and then put the sum. Okay and then put a p b inside the sum. 1 P 2 3 Are you understanding what is going on? Do you understand? Now do one thing again. Put the value of b inside a. Then cut out the one and put t inside b. Put the value of sum inside b. Instead of t, I put ri and put the sum of these two inside the sum i.e. F, so I hope you.Something must be visible here, once we make it bigger, okay listen back, okay, here we are doing all the things well, okay, first this step, second, put the value of B inside A, then put the value of sum inside B, these three steps, we created three variables and in the beginning, A and B were given just one, then we are performing these three steps again and again, now let's look back once, okay, I have put B inside A.After putting the value, I removed the 'u' and put the value of '3', inside 'b', after removing the value of 'b', I put the value of 'f' and in the sum, I put the sum of these two, 8. Okay, now when you see all these things again, you will release something or the other, put the value of 'b' back inside 'b', put the value of 'sum' inside the sum, '5', 8, 13, again, back inside a we putWe put 8 inside B, we put 13, inside even, the sum of these two is 21. Now just notice the even variable for one turn. We are running this again and again, isn't the loop going on? Why is this because it has to be done in the loop itself, when we are doing this thing again and again? We have executed this thing many times till now, so this is 2 3 5 8 13 21. The next one will definitely be 34. This is our FINA series, isn't it?Very smartly, we are putting all the Fina's numbers inside our sum variable, similarly inside B we are also putting 1 2 3 5 8 13 and so on, inside this also we will put D and D, but first of all, we are putting all our series in it, okay, we just have to relate it to how much our number is going to be. Pay attention here, what is 21, 21 is my A, Fina's number, here, see, a couple of times, this is our G.The sixth thing is that off course is going to be my eth number. Do you understand what I am trying to say here? Let's code it once and then we will dry run it. I just told you a few things to build it in intuition so that you think a little and okay and straight away we code it. We come here, where did brother go, come to the loop and write here FOC D C is okay and off course inside this also we do some things.You will copy and paste the same as factorial. Okay, brother, okay, now the screen is visible better. So, I have taken one number. Follow me. A, you have to make a fine number. Now let's remove all these things. Just for now, I have taken one number. I said bring three variables, int A, put one inside it, then int B, put one inside that too in the box, then write int even, for now, put something in it.
Put t or put zero, you can do anything, okay, this should make it easy, now I have to run a loop, so for int, how many times do I have to run the loop, as many times as my number is, okay here there will be a mistake, which we will correct, I am doing it deliberately, from int aa = 1 to how many times we are running the loop, let's say we are running the loop n times because the ith number is required, i p p, okay, what are the steps we had to do here, look back, what are the steps.What we had to do here is, first of all, put it inside the sum, how much p a p b, sorry, just put a p b, here it is okay, put a + b inside the even, then put the value of b inside a and the value of b, put the even value inside b. Please do not change the order of these two. Look here, like I first did a = b, then b = even. If instead of this, I first do what is called b = even and then do a = b, then there is no meaning left in them because.The value of sum has been inserted in b. Suppose there is some s value in b, then the same value will come in a again later. So this order is very important. Okay, in a we have inserted the value of b. Inside b, we have inserted the value of sum. At the end, we do one thing. We print and check our sum. Then print and check our sum. Okay. Percentage D. Percentage D. For once, I am writing the sum like this only. Let's see what is ours.FINA is going to come that number or else then enter number, I say like 8 then the answer is 55. Well, the number is 55, otherwise look here, 55 is our 10th FINA number. Well, let's do one thing by putting six in the enter number. So here if I do six then it comes to 21. Well, in six, 21 is coming. According to the computer, this is six and this is our eight. Okay, so there is a difference of two or two.Do you understand that there is a difference between two things, so we can solve this thing easily because we ourselves saw that if we run a doti ch pa 6 loop six times, then the value of off course sum is coming 21, which is coming in the computer also 21 and here also it is coming 21, when I tried to do it manually like this, when we tried running the code manually, then also the value 2 is coming whereas 21, what is our friend?This is happening because suppose the loop which is running is running like this, okay, before that, already one and one first and second term is already there, so it is a very simple thing, we can do one thing, what is if if, what is happening with us, if we assume n, we are getting g, then our answer is coming, friend 21 f is actually the eighth term, okay, so whatever our n is coming, then we have to according to that.You are getting n + 2s phonekeys, according to this code, just do one thing, put n - 2 here, okay, if I put n -2 here in the loop, then the work will be done, see, I do it again, enter number at, then see 21 is coming, okay, if I enter number six, now actually at is coming, see, 1 2 3 4 5 6, six term is coming at, so all the work is done like this.Do you understand what I have done in the code, see whatever I am getting n, I have to run the loop twice less than that so that I get that number because the loop is actually being run from here, look, the value of a was one, the value of b was one, then look here, I ran the loop, here it is written, loop, then the value of the sum became a + b, that is, the value of the sum became two, okay, then look at our a, the value of b also became one in a.Here comes two in B. Just notice the sum. Then in the next iteration, the value of sum will be three. Then in the next iteration, five, in the next, 8, in the next, 13, in the next, 21. Okay, so actually, when in the code, I just give six, six times when the loop runs, then directly the answer comes to 21. But I have to show that that is the eighth final number. So I will do two first. Just write the number here n - 2. Okay.I will run the loop less number of times, if I need 6 times, then I will run the loop four times, then it is a simple thing, so see, if the number is n, then I am going to run the loop n - 2 times, so much maths, you must be understanding it, okay friend, so let's see here, whether there is any shortcoming, like suppose I write enter number, because look, it is going from one to n - 2, so if I enter the number three, then the answer is two, yes, third.Our term is two, it is correct, then if I put four, then that will also be the correct answer, three, fourth term is my three, fifth term is five, rest all are.
That's right, but if I put only number one or two, then what will happen, won't there be a problem, let's see, I enter number two, then how much should be my second term, look here, second term should be my three, now here, sorry, my second term should be one, so let's look here, press enter, zero has come, the answer is zero, the answer has come, what should we do to solve it, I run back, first term is coming, okay, this is happening because IThe sum was initialized to zero and if I put n as 2 then 2 might be 0 aa ev aa le e 0 this loop will never run if I put a as w or anything out of two and if I put n with n then the loop will run then when this loop does not run then the value of sum is printed as it is, ok there is just a work around for this. Is it simple? Instead of sum you just put one in place of sum then see the answer again.Exactly right, I do enter number one, one will come, okay, the first term is our one, I say enter number two, then one will come, okay, here let's improve the code a bit that the fina's fina's key off percentage d is percentage d, so fina off simple, we can write here n is equal, look, I do f, so fina off f, that is, f fina term can also be written like this, if we remove the percentage d, then the fith is percentage.Percentage D A Okay see, I write six so the six is fina's term 8 Now I say friend my a the ana term 21 So I say on ya friend 15 the 15 phone's term is 6110 is quite a big number okay so we can solve this thing by doing like this fina by the way we can also solve the series in O of V also in a very simple way ok is the mathematics.By using the golden ratio, but I will tell you about it in the next lecture, it is very interesting and well, the next question is now friend, this is going to be a homework for you, I will not do it, this is homework, print first n phoneki numbers means you have to show this in the output, okay, the first, you have to show the output like this, if suppose you get n, 7, then you have to show like this, the first fobo key, okay, then the first fina key number, nunan number, not nunar, what did I write?Here the number is one, then you have to write the number of the second fina is one, then you have to write further two, then you have to write three, then you have to write fi, then you have to write eight, then show you 1 2 3 4 5 6, then you have to write 13, okay in the seventh, so you have to print it like this, you will do it yourself and this is going to be solved exactly like what we did with the factorial, we are inside the loop itself, like here I have written print F here, right?You can write the rest of the hints here, I will not tell you the rest, you will solve it yourself. Let's go ahead friend and solve this question. After that, we have one or two and some two or four questions left. This lecture will be over and the next lecture is going to be very explosive which will solve the question on pattern printing. What is there, two numbers are entered through the keyboard. Okay, assume A and B, both the numbers are fine.Is write a program to find the value of one number ray to the power of another means if I take input of two numbers a and b then I have to print and show the power of a is b. Suppose both the numbers are my value of a is 0 and value of b is my 5 then I have to print the answer 2 ray to the power of 5 i.e. whatever is 32 or whatever I have given, if I have given the rate of 10 to the power of 7 then print that.If we have to do it then we have to print it like this, then how will we solve it? Again, we can solve this through loops. How should we know one thing? Whenever I say 2 to the power of 5, let's take a to the power of b, then 2 to the power of 5 is something like this. We can write it like this: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 means, the power of any can be anything. We multiply the same number as many times as I want.The exponent is ok, it is five times, so if you multiply t by itself five times, then the power of t will become 5. If you multiply t ten times, then it will become the power of 3. Do you understand that by doing this, we can solve it, so this is our simple guess that came from the loop, you will think that it can be solved.It is a simple thing, if you want to find out anything, then you have kept the variables A and B, then you just have to do one thing, create a new variable, how much can you get?
It's okay with the name var or make it any variable, okay, initialize it with one for once. Then friend, you run your for loop or run any loop n times, whatever is the number of times you want to run it. B times, you run the loop again and again. In this loop, you just write that power e is equal to power in a, which is the base below us. You have to multiply it again and again. Don't you understand? Look at me, the value of power is one and how many times will my loop run here.If I multiply two five times as much as my number is, then I will get the answer 32. Keep in mind that I am creating a new variable here, I am not using power one, I am not using two only, I will not modify two again and again, it will get into big trouble. Okay, so this is a very good thing, I am going to tell you here that what is power one, now once I have given you a little hint, I have told you the whole code, by the way, try solving it yourself.Then I will show you the entire solution of what I am trying to say. Okay, now I will show you the complete solution. First let's go straight to the code. Now you must be a little advanced in the code, so I have hope in coding. Here we write that power is ok dot C because we have to extract the power a ray to power b. So here we write the entire code once again in which we will have to write a few things. Okay, no one, first we would take a number.Int a is okay and then we also write int b right here, let's write int a b two here, I made boxes, I wrote print F, write P here friend, enter base base means the bottom number, expo ant means the top number, so enter base here, then we took it enter scan a percentage d and write here our end a a, I am assuming that I copy and paste my base similarly, friend and write here enter exponential power that.How much is the power of two and we are storing it in B, that is the number of powers, now what do you have to write here, take a new variable, this power or anything int C, you can also take it from one for one turn, that is why we are converting it from one, not from zero, because you will multiply zero with anything, here the power is being multiplied again and again, so it will become zero, okay, our power has become one, and now we have to run the loop loop here.Friend, how many times will it run, it is a simple thing, as many times as I have to multiply the number, I told you the theory, how it happens, then you can say for int i = 1 i < = b because b is my power, so many times, if I run my loop and write that product again and again, what should I put in product, product i is equal to product, where did I go, ok, I am writing product, I am so sorry power was my variable then power i is equal to two.I am multiplying the power into A by A. I repeat the power again and again and print the power in the last check. It is possible that I have made a small mistake here, but you will understand the overall logic of the code. Okay, now I print F directly. Can we write here? Our first number was A, so write here A is the raise to the power B is the product. This power is fine, so here we write A B power C. The language is so strange.Let's run it and see, man, enter base2, enter power f 2 rate power 5 e 32, it's so good, my whole code is coming right, now there is a little limitation in it which we will see later but once let's see how it is running our code, let's dry run it so that we will dry run it very quickly and quickly, what can we say, we will finish it, okay, let's bring it back here and that's it, I am running the code.Okay, just look at this code, let's assume what I have taken, man, I have taken A and B, let's say I have taken F. Okay, let's write power 4. Let's write F. Now what I am doing is, first of all, from A to B. Okay, so I am running this loops five times. Okay, as many times as my power. I have taken a new variable named power. Okay, I have taken a new variable named power and one turn.Put the value one in it now again and again power is equal to two Now the value of power is 1 into a The value of a is 2 So inside the power put two so put here t Then our i becomes plus plus so aa goes ahead i is going to run five times our
Here you can also write a but anyway, next time the loop runs then power is equal to two, the value of power is two, this time and the value of two is also two, so four has been put in power, you understand that it will happen like this, then again power is equal to two, the value of power is four but the value of a is still two, so 4 * 2 8. Okay, then similarly here power is equal to power * 2.So 8 * 2 16 and finally for the fifth time power e is 16 * 2 i.e. 32 and at last we got it printed. Simple anytime friend, if you are getting one less print like suppose you have mistakenly labeled i, then what to do then you will see what is the problem in the code. If the answer of 16 is coming or 64 is not coming anywhere then you can check that of course, ok then that's enough.Fairly friend, our question was simple, if it is not written here, can I give you homework? Suppose I have given you the base 2 and have given you the power n. Okay, so what you have to do is power of 2, 1 to the power of 2, power of 2, 3 to the power of 2, 4 to the power of 2, 5 to the power of 2, 6 up to the power of 2, n, you have to print everything in different lines, think yourself how to do it.Again, it is very simple, our values are changing again and again inside the loop. Pay attention, all the values of power are becoming powers of two. Okay, let's do one thing. Now friend, let's go back to the code. Once again in the code, friend, let's enter one and see what it means. I enter enter base to power and then the answer is 2 to the power 1 is 2. Okay, 2 to the power 0. What happens if I do enter base to power 0 2.To the power 0 is one. Yes, so this is our code is always working. How come, what is happening in the case of 2 rate power 0, if b is 0 then this loop is not running and we had initialized the power to one, already one answer is coming so ok you can try other things here, if I write power of 3 is 5 then 243 is coming, see 243 is coming so of course all these things are working for us.It will work with all the numbers, not only with two, because our code is absolutely correct here, only we have not seen two in general.Do you remember all the Esc values? What are the values of capital A? 65 SmallEquivalent characters of 26 alphabets using a while loop, basically what we have to print, I will tell you here, I have to print this, let's remove it back and first of all we write in the alphabets, whatever is small case or capital case is fine because alphabets also have two of us, so we will talk about the capital case now, then later we will do both, basically what we have to show by printing, we have to show it by printing like this.Okay, we have to write A 65, then in the next line it is written B 66, then C 67, then D 68 up to whatever our root is 90, this value will come. Okay, you can show it as you wish, it is okay by hitting the arrow, you can show it by printing, then how will you print this thing, tell me one thing, if I have to print only the numbers from 65 to 90, can you do it off course?You can do this thing very easily. Like, there is no doubt that you can do it. Just make a loop from 65 to 90. For int i = 6 6, then i < = 90. Okay, i. What you have to do is to print these also in front of them. Either see, print this and show it, or it is the same thing, or print this and show 65a 66b 67c, that is the same.The thing is, you can print it as per your wish and show it, so how will you do it? Here, I told you the concept of value clearly. Here we can use type casting. I will show you what type casting is, I will teach you that also. Teaching type casting is not too much, not too much, but yes, it is important, it is quite important, okay, so that's it.
Let's keep the name S S K D C, it's okay, the spelling is a little wrong, but it's okay, then there is nothing to be done, let's write the whole thing back in this code. We write this code, where is the STD D H? In this time, we can do the int main function. Then we write return zero here. It's okay and okay brother, so let's code here, which one is the value of A. I have to print all the values before that.I am going to teach you that what is what is type casting, okay, maybe I have already told you in the first lecture, let me tell you once again about type casting, let's say mine is int A or int, anyHere let's print theA x E K S =Clear care C print the character of one. To print the value of A, we do this work and do this again. Another thing we can do is if suppose I had written all this instead of all these things, if I had written that look care C is equal to two, already I have given A here. Okay, look at this care C, let's say I have printed it here. Control C is okay and then I write our int x is equal to two. I can also write like this.Int of C and then if I print myWe can use the entire thing in the loop which is given here because we have to print all the characters again and again and then it is going to be quite simple. Put this thing in the loop, look at it, remove it and remove this thing. In the simple loop, we have to print all the things and show them, so in this we do not even need to take any input from the user because we have to print all the alphabets, so write directly for int a = 65, start from 65 only.Come, this is 90, it is okay, the value of our root is 90 and write it here. Those who do not understand, go and watch the lecture, the old one has been explained well in it. Suppose, here I print A, percentage D, okay, percentage D, I write the base n here and I write it here. So, what will this loop print according to you? According to me, it will print the numbers from 65 to 90. Look brother, look at this.Now all the numbers from 65 to 90 have been printed here. 65 to 90 is fine, now what do I have to do? Next to these numbers, I have to print the character on this side or that side, that is, the character is the values of all these a's, so simple just go here, friend, do not do anything, you know that the value of i is changing again and again, so make a character again and again, friend, care is equal to care.Off is okay, care off, sorry, not like this, type cast is done like this, here we write care, so care off, whatever is our value, aa is our integer, in this case, come and write, simple, print it back here, look, print F, okay, and here, don't give a back sl, this time, give an enter, just write here and here, print F back sl c means saw.
Re percentage c and then you also put an enter and print pe c here now see what difference will come see this simple 65a 66 b 67 c 68d Do you understand man it is not so cool in the last 90 h so because of type casting we were able to solve this thing very lovingly with so much ease what a wonderful thing we thought of this ok if you want to make it better then you can do one thing, first you write the number.You can see like this and later you can do this work, okay write it like this, okay now let's print it once and see a nice print will come out, a value of a is 65, b is 66, c is 67 and so on, z is 90, I hope you have understood this question, let's go ahead, this is your homework, this is a good question, it is okay to try it yourself. Write a program to print out all the Armstrongs.Numbers between 1 and 500, so you have to run a loop, you have to count from 1 to 500, you just have to see which are the numbers from 1 to 500 which are Armstrong numbers. Look, what is Armstrong number? If the sum of cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself then the number is Armstrong number. It is a very amazing thing like 153 is an Armstrong number, why?How many digits are there in 153? 1, 5 and 3. Okay, what is amazing is the cube of 1 + the cube of 5 + the cube of 3. Actually, it gives me the answer of 153. There will definitely be more numbers like this. There are also our numbers here but you have to think for yourself like one in itself is an Armstrong number, there is only one digit and the cube of one is also one.153 is an Armstrong number, there may be two or four more Armstrong numbers like this, you have to print all the numbers from 1 to 500, so what is the hint, friend, your first hint is that the off course loop will work from 1 to 500, it is fine, you repeat it again and again, what you have to do is pay attention. Again the hint is this: cube of 1, cube of 5, cube of 3, I can also write this as cube of 3, cube of 5.Cube of Q + 1. If you remember when I was finding out the sum of digits, we have coded the sum of digits. Just what to do here is to code the cubes of that too. So think about this on your own and try to solve it. Okay, that was all for this lecture. It must have been a bit long lecture but I hope you are clear about the loops, each and every thing. If you have watched the lecture till now, then Hare Har.Like your turn, please write in the comments that you enjoyed it, till now I have watched the entire lecture completely and have understood everything. Do you feel that from your end, you want to give feedback, are there any things that I can improve, please do write in the comments, thank you very much bye bye.
