Like every time, today's very important topic for 12th syllabus 2026 aspirants in the WAR series will be Magnetic Forces and Magnetic Effects of Current.So we will divide this session into two parts and as usual the frequently asked question in the chat will be that what will be the length of this particular session?What theory will be taught?DPPs will be given solutions, I will answer them all quickly and then will dive into the session.Ok?So the length of the session will be approximately 5 hours.Right?Plus minus some periods will not be of 6 hours.Right?The end will be just above 4 hours.And make sure that this will be a very important topic.This will be your backbone for next topic which will be our EMI and AC.So if you do this topic properly along with our previous topics of Electrostatics Current Electricity RC Circuits extra extra then it will help you a lot in the EMI chapter.So that's the first point.Second Age Ordinary Theory will also be taught.Problems will also be given from basic to advanced level.Ok?And this topic as usual will be integrated with a DPP.DPP Will Contain Two Levels.One will be Mains level and the other will be Advanced level.And you will find all this information about DPs in the description below.You will also find some things in the description of the main session in the live chat today.So very quickly as always right at the start of the session I will flash you the DPP key.I will show it once in the ending also.You will get the file anyway.Right, you can also get that DPP from Unacademy platform or you can also access it from the Nexus tlegram group. Okay, so all the things you know as usual and as usual, whatever homework you will get in our session apart from DPP is anyway your homework, apart from that, some questions right which we will do in this particular session, its extension questions i.e. some level up questions, you will get Physics Sir which is our channel.In collaboration with Unacademy, its playlist will include today's playlist.If you scroll down on the home page, you will find many words on Electromagnetism Challenges.These are both of today's session.Like I said, our session today will be divided into two parts.First will be on magnetic forces.Second would be the magnetic effect of current, which comes from Biosaver's Law and Ampere's Law.So that part.Both of these I Think Now plus Art Somewhere Around 17 videos before we start off our next session which will be EMI AC.Right?Your war series will be completed next month.EMR AC Aayega Optics and Modern Physics.These will be your sessions next month so that you can go for proper revision in December.Ok?Right?Many children have already started revision.Right?You too can move forward in a very good way.Before we start the session very quickly use this code right now in case you are in the plan of taking up the Plus subscription or you want to renew it. You are my already student. Let's assume you want to renew for one more year. You can be an aspirant at 26 or even at 27. Then this is the code and you will get 60% discount on the Plus subscription for 2026 aspirants.Another announcement will come as soon as possible, we are planning a crash course in some time.So that will also be included in this.You will see.Next A: If you have any juniors in your family or friends then this is right for 2027 aspirants.This batch has been launched.Its classes will start on 31st October.I have already uploaded the explainer video of this batch.If you have any relevant people please forward it to them.You will get the entry of this particular batch through a Google form.You will find that pin in the comments below.You will see once.If it is relevant to you.You use it.Otherwise you forward it to people who find it relevant.This is the DPP you are going to get at the end of this session.So these are properly curated questions.You will get questions of Mains level as well as JE Advanced level.I would assume that you will have to take this as taste.This first one is 32 Questions You Have to Take Somewhere Around One and a Half Hour.And these 41 questions are below
JE Advanced Level K That You Need to Write It as a Test for Two Hours.Set a timer and solve it properly.Then you will get the solution file anyway.Check it and come back to our Telegram group.I will have my own Telegram group, which will have 11 links on this particular channel, otherwise there will be a dropdown in it.You will find the link to Students Doubts Group there.So you can come there and discuss.Right?Let's check the lighting once.Let's start with the basic definition of magnetic field.Ok?Right?So we saw in electrostatics and current electricity that the definition of electrostatic field was in the name of force.Right?So electric field was equal to force vector by test charge q.Right?Because the force there was simple.When force you used to write there that is q times of e times i.e. force is along the field.Do you understand?Right?In electrostatics, the direction of the electric field can be parallel or anti-parallel to its direction, that is, it can be parallel or anti-parallel.So you used to get force in the same along direction.But the definition of magnetic field is a bit complicated.So initially when you are reading, it requires a few sessions to digest and understand it.Some problem solving is required.Which we will do in full today.Right?There will be end cross product involvement.Right?Which means the force will not actually be along the field.The force will actually be perpendicular to the field.So this would be the definition of magnetic field as force on a moving charge.Ok?This moving charge is a very important point.Electric force was on a charge.The one who may or may not be moving.Makes no sense.Value of charge is given.If there was an electric field, a force would definitely be applied.It will apply even if you are on rest.It will be felt even if you are moving.I am talking about electric force.But experimentally he noticed that there are all these laws like magnetic force, just like we have Coulomb's law in electrostatics.Here too this loss was observed. It was experimentally observed that presence of charge is not a sufficient condition.The movement of charge was a sufficient condition to calculate and/or feel the magnetic force.So after series of experiments they found out that the magnetic force is coming out to be q * v cross q * vx v Okay right so just in a special case where all the three forces are there whenever the cross product is required, you assume three mutually perpendicular directions right so three mutually perpendicular directions this is how you can visualize it is not thatWe are talking about a special case where V and B are always perpendicular in that diagram.So when a point charge is moving in the rightwardNow the immediate question will be that where did the origin of the magnetic field which we have written there come from?Like the electric field which we wrote about in Electrostatics and Current Electricity, its origin was charge.Any charge may be moving or at rest.I think it produces an electric field at a distance r 1 / r² Coulomb's Law, that's what it's all about.So similarly we should be curious here as to who is the source of this magnetic field?So we will read two major sources in our syllabus.One is that any current i.e. moving charge itself produces magnetic field.What is the meaning of current?Charges Which Are Moving.So any moving charge and a current is considered to be the source of magnetic field.Right?What is direction?All that will be its separate law.Like Coulomb's Law tells us what is the electric field of any charge distribution?Similarly, in this particular session, we will also read that in this particular chapter.But for now, summarize in your mind that any current produces a magnetic field.
Can do.Not only that, magnets are found naturally in the earth, there are some substances which we will call ferromagnetic substances later.You will also see those magnets from above and you will not see any current in them.Since this is a wire, no current flowing here will be visible microscopically.But when you look inside it and analyze it in depth, you will find that there are some electrons moving inside which are the microscopic currents which are responsible for producing magnetic field lines.So in the first initial situation, when someone asks you at the beginning of this chapter, what can produce a magnetic field?To current elements and current carrying wires and bar magnets.These are the two sources.You will have to answer.So these are the magnetic field sources.Due to these sources, someone has produced a similar magnetic field here and some other charge is moving in it with a velocity greater than the force. The factor is this.This is the idea.So by measuring the magnetic force acting on a charge moving at a velocity v bar we can obtain the value of b bar.So this has to be reversed.To define magnetic field, throw a test charge with some non-velocity inside the magnetic field.Measure its force and know the reverse force indirectly.You know the charge.Know your velocity.Then you can calculate the value of magnetic field.That's how the magnetic field is defined.So by taking magnitudes of that cross product equation, which is the cross product of your equation, here you have to take the magnitude.So qvb sin theta will come where theta is the angle between v and b. Here it is showing 90° but in general its angle can be theta.Right?Then qvb sinta then your force value will come out from there.So the value of p will be written as you get the magnitude and qv sin theta.So usually in these experiments, sin theta sin theta is taken as 90° to do easy calculations.Is it clear?Right?So let's move ahead.What will we do now?Electric force we already know from the previous session which is q*e.And just now we have freshly defined the magnetic force.When a moving charge moves in a magnetic field, we write the magnetic force equation for it.Right?So when you add these two, it is called Lawrence Force.So electromagnetic force is also named Lawrence force.And Remember This Lawrence Force Is The Same In All Inertial Frames.Whichever inertial frame you go into.You will read later in the Electromagnetism chapter that this wave will be frame dependent.This B bar will also be frame dependent.That means you are moving with some velocity, the fields present in that particular region will change - electric field and magnetic field.But their combined force or their addition to the combined force will remain the same.So this is the same in all inertial frames.This is a very important thing.This means that actually electric and magnetic forces do not exist separately in nature.This is how we read.Our chapters, our understanding and when our ancestors and physicists were reading nature, they were observing nature.So these were revealed individually.So when individually revealed, the books and chapters are written like this.But now standing in 21st century you should understand that this is combined.We call it Lawrence F.This will be very important later when you study light and electromagnetic waves.So for now let's assume that this and this individually are frame dependent but the combination is frame independent.Provided you are talking about inertial frame.That frame frame transformations and all those things about non-inertial are beyond the scope of our JEE syllabus.But for now, theoretically, you should take this much care.Right?When we express all these things in Q * V B sin theta which we wrote in the previous slide, then we have to find out the units of B.If B is defined then units of B have to be found.So when you know the units of all the other elements.Then the SI unit would be Newton * Second by Coulomb Meter.If something complicated like this comes up then he will have to pay attention to it.
Yes, it will be repetitive, just like an electric field repeats.So we will call it One Tesla.So Tesla is the SI unit.T is the symbol for it.And generally a Tesla is a very big unit.Like our capacitance used to have Farad, right?The SI unit of Farad is a very large unit.So we commonly used it up to micro farad, milli farad.Similarly Tesla will become a very huge unit.You must have seen magnets for MRI scans in big hospitals.It will be written there at the beginning of the door that beware here the magnetic field is very strong and it is written two Tesla 1.5 Tesla 3 Tesla at the max tells you that three Tesla is a very very dangerous amount of field to affect you.Ok?So we can feel the magnetic field of the ordinary earth.We can also do experiments on it.And that is a very standard field.So his order is 10 power-4 times Tesla.So, just as we remember that we used a common unit of atmospheric pressure called Pascals vs Atmosphere, similarly we will use a common unit called Gaussian.Ok?So Gauss is a very standard unit.It is not just like that.Right?Standard common unit used in day to day life activities.Gauss is the order of Earth's magnetic field and that one tesla is 10 power 4 gauss and or the other way around remember you one gauss is 10 power-4 tesla these are the same units.Ok?Right?So you will measure it with the right hand thumb rule.And when both fields exist, you will calculate and add both forces individually.For example, in capacitor plates there is an electric field between positive and negative charges.Similarly, any magnet has a north pole or a south pole.So keep North in your mind that it is a positive pole and South is a negative pole.So the field which will be the magnetic field will go from positive pole to negative pole.So this field map should be very-very clear in your mind.So these are basic slides.We Will Do Lot of Problems Also Today.Right?Like I said in the beginning, I will not pay much attention to the chat.Your attention should also be on the screen and wherever the question flashes, you have to pause, solve it and move ahead.Whatever doubts you may have, when this session is completed in the main chat, the duration will not exceed approximately five hours.Right?Will will be completing all the things with in that time span.After that, if you ask for doubts by writing a time stamp, I will answer.Ok?Right.Let us ask a question on Lawrence Force which is an electromagnetic force.NCRT Exemplar is a good problem set, MCQ One and MCQ Two NCRT Exemplar is very easy.This is properly recommended.There are basic questions.There is a very good collection of questions in Physics.I get this done in my courses, be it Physics Surgery or Nexus courses.Highly recommended.Our crash course is also coming in Nexus.Right?Announcement will be made soon.So this will be part and parcel in that also.So pause this question and try for a minute.One more than one is correct.I have taken this from MCQ Two.V is times - V is.And four options are given.More than one may be correct.So I'm assuming.You paused and read the question.So I'm going ahead with the solution.I will also study with you first.A cubical region of space is filled with uniform electric and magnetic fields.A uniform field is the electric and magnetic fields.The electron enters the cube across one of its faces with velocity V times.In such books, they do not write V in a bold font like Rido.In our exams the bar will be written above.So don't worry.And a positron enters via object face with a velocity of - V times.So these are equal and opposite charges and also equal and opposite velocities.The sign of Q is reversed and the sign of V bar is also reversed.By the way, entering.Given four options about electric and magnetic forces.So first let's write the Lorenz force once.We will get practice.Q * E times + Q * VB Is it Lorenz force?You can see that if this is a sign of electron then
This object of positron will become negative.Right?Compare that direction and this one.I think this is negative and this is also given negative brother.So overall I think it will be the same for positron and electron.Do you understand?This is same for both.Right?He has reversed the velocity.So the overall force is not the same on individual electrons and positrons.One part same, one part upside down and one part same.So let's read the question options.Electric forces on both particles cause identical accelerations.It is wrong.Acceleration is a vector.So the magnitude will be the same but its direction is reversed because of this component.So this is a wrong option.Magnetic forces on both particles cause equal accelerations.This is what came, didn't it?So, this is the correct answer.Both particles gain and lose energy at the same rate.Now what is meant by rate of energy.Rate of energy is f times power.So when you take its dot product, you see one important thing that because of the magnetic force, it is the cross product. When you take its dot product, it is zero.So here one important thing you have to remember is that magnetic forces never work.That the power delivered is zero.See how our tension used to be in uniform circular motion.When you are winding up a string, the tension is always perpendicular to velocity.He doesn't work there either.In the case of satellites, a satellite is going around the Earth.So the gravitational force becomes exactly perpendicular to velocity, right?So gravitational force will not work there also.So magnetic field comes in that category.Ok?So, when you take this complete dot product, this will actually become only Q * E * V. This is what will happen, right?And you can see that again this is exactly negative for both particles.This dot product is also negative brother.Because the velocity of both is opposite.So this negative * negative overall will be same for both.Same for both.First we canceled the effect of the magnetic field itself.It doesn't deliver power.And the power of the electric field became the same due to double negative.So both will lose and gain energy at the same rate.Correct.And motion of center of mass is determined by B alone.What is meant by motion of center of mass.Which will be your ACM value, that would be given by Fed / M. Acceleration of center of mass.And overall F bar is decided b both na.Acceleration of center of mass is decided by both where there is change in kinetic energy or work done power delivered it is only electric field decides.There is a lot of difference between the two.The perpendicular centripetal force that occurs in uniform circular motion determines how the motion is taking place.It cannot change kinetic energy.So understand that.Option D is incorrect.It is determined by both magnetic field and electric field.Ok?So this is wrong.So in such an easy way, when this question comes in the exam conditions, you can easily overcome it in JE Advanced.Ok?Let's move ahead.I hope you understand this.I have put two questions in the same page because they are similar.Let us first ask the above question.One minute.Ok?Right?Your attention should also be on the above questions.Pause and try this question for 2 minutes and then go ahead with the solution.I'm going.I'm assuming you tried.I'm moving.Ok?Yes.A charged particle will continue to move with a constant velocity in a region where it should move at a constant velocity.Constant velocity means constant velocity vector.Remember.That means acceleration is zero, brother.Acceleration is a zero vector.And when electric and magnetic fields come together, there is a Lawrence force on that particle.The charged particle is the same.So, q * e + q * vb which is the total force because the acceleration is zero.It should be absolutely zero.So, out of these four options, more than one can be correct.So, you have to find options that obey this particular equation.Ok?The easiest one is show me D option.If both the fields are zero then it will obviously be zero.Right?So let's start attacking from option D.Ok?Right?Now this can happen
That is if it is individually non-zero.This is a P bar from one A let's.Or you write like this.This is an A bar.is x times.This is the entire vector y times.If their total sum is zero.If the sum of two vectors is zero then they must be of equal and opposite magnitude.Only then can it happen.Both individually have to be zero.We saw that in the fourth option.Or it cannot be that one is zero and the other is not zero, brother.So that will conclude that whichever option has zero and the other one is not zero will be gone.For example e = 0.Let's say E = 0.So it became zero.You want this also to be zero.Yes, B may be without zero when B and B become parallel.Their cross product should be zero.So this is also correct.In this you want V parallel to B or anti parallel to B so that the cross product becomes zero.Let's check this.If E is not zero.Yes.Let's check C first.The C one will be easier.Now look at the C one.If B becomes zero then Y becomes zero.And if e is not equal to 0 then it cannot be zero.I think this is gone.Option C is not correct because neither the second vector is becoming zero nor the first vector can be zero.This means total force cannot be zero.The one with P survived.Where both are non-zero.This is very easy.What is there in it? Let me tell you a simple condition.Its i should be capped.The direction i of the electric field becomes capped.And both of them need -i cap.Keep this in mind that imagine this is in the k cap direction and this is in the j cap direction.And k crossed j was -i.You adjust their values ​​such that their values ​​become exactly the same magnitude wise and in negative directions.Right?So this is also correct.So A B D are possibilities.D can't be there.Ok?So for this B option, I took this green possibility.Ok?I am writing possible here.We're done with the first one.Second one too, pause once and try for one minute.I got this second one from HC Verma.HC Verma has very good objective one and objective two questions.If you are still in 12th, you have not attempted those questions properly from any chapter.Generally my method is for my students whether online or offline.I tell them to take the same objective one and objective two as a test at the end of the chapter.+3 0 for single option and 0 for more than one, which is in your JE Advanced, not on an average, for each single option question with partial marking, you spend 2 minutes and for more than one, 3 to 4 minutes, prepare like a test and check yours and ask your teacher for doubts.So these are questions of the same particular category.I got this from One and More Than One.So more than one can be correct.So let's do it together.A charged particle goes undeflected in a region containing electric and magnetic fields.Undeflected, this constant velocity has acceleration equal to zero.Undeflected need not mean constant velocity.Undeflected means straight line motion.This one is a straight line.There could be constant velocity or there could also be constant acceleration.For example, if we drop a particle under gravity, it goes down in a straight line while accelerating but it will not deflect.Ok?So deflected undeflected means straight line motion curve should not be there that's all.It means straight line motion.Ok?Ok.Yes.So if this is straight line motion, what are the possibilities in the electric and magnetic fields?Again, each option has to be checked using the same Lorenz Force.It is possible, he said.Just have to check.So if E and B are parallel and V and E are parallel, put conditions for each option.Ok?Right?Um yes.You have to write qe times + q * vsb and take the parallel one.Ok?So imagine everyone is in the direction of i cap.This is also I cap.This is also I cap.This is also I cap.e parallel to e cap parallel to b so this cross product becomes zero.And this one is the only force and that too in the I cap direction.And your force is in the eye cap direction.Velocity is in the eye cap direction.This is straight line accelerated motion, isn't it?Yes there will be no constant velocity but
Rate line may occur.Right?So this is a possibility.Ok?Now for this we have to check that E is not parallel to B. You have to check that if E is not parallel to B, can it make straight line motion?You have to check like this.Even in one possible case, if he gets a straight line then this option is correct.So write the same again.What do you want?q*es Sorry if you took e and b in different directions in q*e+q*vs.Imagine this is in the j cap direction.Ok?And if you want, take this also in j cap direction.If you want E and V to be in the same direction and the force of B does not come, then a similar situation will arise.So if you try this particular force forcibly.You want that force to become zero.It should come in J or J direction.Because if I take the velocity in any other direction instead of J then the electric field will curve it.Right?You and I can take the same thing.You can buy it only with constant velocity.Right?So what will we do intentionally?So what do I do with this J?Will try to get this J canceled.Will try to bring -j now.So I would think this is the i cap.This is k cap.So now think, I took inspiration from this question.A special case of undeflected is constant velocity.So I took the same in three different perpendicular directions so that this VB force gets canceled by this QE force and goes undeflected with constant velocity.So this is a possibility.So option B is also correct.So the inspiration for option B is constant velocity question.V of C is parallel to B but E is not parallel to it.That means you cannot take this case.These two are parallel brother.So check the same again.I think I can see but for your convenience I am writing in full.You want V and B to be in the same direction.When V and B are in the same direction.I think this is J and J has become zero.is the null vector.And you have to take E in some other direction.You can't take J because they said not parallel so may be you take it in any direction problem will be that force is in one direction and velocity is in its perpendicular direction then there will be curve and once it is curvilinear motion we can't say undeflected then answer of B is wrong you can't mark ok right last E is parallel to B but V isNot parallel to E i.e. you take E and B in one direction and try to take V in some other direction.I try to make a combination of the last one.Q * VP again Q * VP You want E parallel B take a direction.II Take both.A is also I and B is also i.Now if total force comes to zero then that is not possible because if you take any force here velocity then it will come perpendicular to i so it cannot cancel PE.So the force will always be there.And whatever force remains, you want it to be parallel to the velocity.Otherwise it will curve.Right?So we can do it like this, see pictorially, you can adjust.E and B are parallel and initially the particle is left at rest.Look at this, this will become a very beautiful situation.You took E and B parallel in the X-axis direction and left the particle like this.So what will happen?The electric field will accelerate it.Magnetic field cannot exert force initially because the charge is at rest.If the charge is starting from rest then the magnetic field will initially be zero.Right?Yes.Then the electric field will develop velocity parallel to B. He said V is not parallel to E. Oh, so we cannot take this case because V is becoming parallel.Here V will come parallel to V E.V will be parallel to B.Ok?But V should not be parallel to E.He had said it.Then this will not be possible.No matter how much you try, this will not be possible because if you have to make the force also zero then imagine ok without acceleration it has to do something then you end up having e = bs v. You want e = bs v to become the ultimate constant velocity. Undeflected acceleration is not available but imagine if you can make the force zero, is this possible?This cannot happen if both are i because it will come perpendicular to i.So not possible.This is also wrong.then C
I checked it in multiple direct ways, it must be there otherwise the answer is A and B only.Ok?Right?If there is any doubt in this, after the session, write down the time stop of this particular point of the video properly.Just like that, at 13 minutes 25 seconds, Sir, you said this, I am feeling wrong or how did this happen?I will answer.You can also watch the previous sessions.I Come Back and I Answer Them Properly for Serious Students.Ok?Write the time stamp properly.Ok?Let's move ahead.What will you do now?Electric Field.There is a lot of mixing of magnetic fields.Now let's focus on the magnetic field.Electric field for some time, for some slides.Right?Keep aside for some problems.Will bring him back later.So imagine.The magnetic field exerts a force on a particular particle in its perpendicular direction.So, as it comes to your mind, whenever there is involvement of cross product, the first visualization of the circular motion that comes to mind in some force comes.So the thing is very simple.If there is a situation like here.You will probably see these inner marks.I hope that represents the in to the board magnetic field and in that you gave the velocity in the plane of the motion.You gave velocity to a particle in the plane of the board.Then that particle will execute a circular motion.Why?Why would there be uniform circular motion?Because I told that magnetic field cannot do work.Whatever force B is, it cannot deliver power.Cannot change speed.So whatever curvature there is at every instant should be continuously the same and which curve whose curvature does not change will be a circle.Right?And we did not tell you this just like that.That has also been checked experimentally.When a magnetic field enters the board, what you see above is a solenoid.We will also condition the solenoid.Here the current of the solenoid is when the solenoid is like a helical current carrying wire.So the magnetic field in it will not be along the axis.So, the red colored solenoid that you are seeing is similar to your MRI scan machine, where a person is going inside like this, in that particular cave, the field inside that cave is like this.Ok?So in the same way think of the cave as the magnetic field inside the board.Right?For example, in this particular situation, if an electron is accelerated and left in it, the electrons circulate.And because of the fluorescence of that particular beam, you can see that it is a circle.This is a real picture brother.This is the real picture.This is not an animation.Ok?Right?So because they could observe this.That's why they are sure that the magnetic field is q*vsb.Observation comes first.Then Comes the Force.So let's write the equation of this uniform circular motion.And we will try to get an equation of a radius.So because V and B are already perpendicular.VB Will Become Just a ProductSo your Q * VB centripetal force should be M * V² / R which is the radius of this circular motion.So from here comes an important formula which you use very often.Don't mug it up, don't remember it.But when you face the problem continuously in three-four situations, you will not be able to forget it automatically.So r = mv / bq This tells you a different thing, if b were zero, there would be no magnetic field and the particle would go in a straight line.A little curve like this will do.Right?You can assume b is for bending.B stands for bending.Ok?So if B were zero then R would be an infinite straight line.If someone has more mass or heavy objects, there will be inertia of motion, then the curve will not be done easily, hence the radius will be larger. Visualize that by keeping the numerators and denominators in the formula zero and think what is the physical significance?If there is too much charge, there will be too much force.Visualize a lot of F in such a way that if you are pulling this particle using a thread, then it will curve quickly.So Q is therefore below.So it's not just a formula.It's Trying to Speak to You.Try to listen to it.Ok?When a vehicle goes at high speed, it has difficulty in turning or taking sharp turns.Therefore, there will be more radius for more velocity.Simple
That's a thing.So you can also think of it as momentum, it is p/bq.Ok?Time period.What will be the calculation of time period?Time Period of the Uniform Circular Motion.t will be 2r / p so when you substitute r I think it will come 2m / b so the things that you will find repeated many times in the questions will be this form and this one with time period and if you look carefully then velocity is not forming a figure in time period, see velocity is canceled so that's a very interesting thing independent of velocity.And that gives you the motivation to write Omega OK Omega which is the angular velocity, remove 2π, remove the same 2π, the number below, 2π / Omega, so it becomes pq / m. Again you can see this is independent of velocity.The Time Period and Angular Velocity Are Independent.This is a very important thing.That is, take two particles of any particle and give velocity to one from the same point and double the velocity to the other particle from the same point.Obviously their radii will be different.But whoever has to come to the starting point, both will come together.That's why this is.By the way, you will see many problems on this part and this particular independence of velocity in previous years Mains and Advanced.We will give him one or two problems.proceed further?Ok.Right?Yes.There is a problem of magnetic force.Please take a look.Again I moved away.Take a pause.Try it for a minute or two.Then check the answer.Ok?I'm assuming you've done it.I am going ahead with the reading of the question.Ok?A region between y = 0 and y = d contains a magnetic field b bar = bz cap.These nta people don't give i cap here.Here k cap can be given but z cap is written.So there is some inconsistency in the language.You can see.I Think You're Good Enough to Understand.Don't get confused in the exam.This is k cap only.A particle of mass m and charge q enters the region with a velocity v.is the velocity in the x direction.And the width of this region is zero to d, this is so, look at this, you can think of it in the form of mv / bq, that is r.Ok?The acceleration of the charged particle at the point of its emergence on the other side is such a question that when you read, first put the diagram of the region being mentioned and then put the diagram of the plane in which the motion is taking place.I am feeling that if the magnetic field is out of the board, then I will take it out of the board in z axis and xy plane is my board and this is y = 0 y = z y = d x xz plane.Ok?This line is parallel to y axis.Sorry line parallel to xz plane.Ok?So y = 0 this is for me and y = d y = He said it.So the exact plane should come like this.This is y = 0.This is y=d brother.Ok?And the magnetic field is out of the board.Find it.This is your D distance.This is your D distance.Ok?And where is this agar particle?Enters the region with a Velocity VI cap.So my X-axis is rightward, so that's where it's entering.Ok?So let's change the color like this.The entry is like this.Ok?So the magnetic field is out of the board.Velocity is like this.So think of the cross product of this V and that B as VB.So B is out.VB z axis, I have taken outward xz plane or y = 0, so enter it here and it will be a curve like this, so let's get it entered here.We have to solve the question.So entering above.He didn't say this, right?Enters the region is said.Where are you entering?It is your choice to ask questions.Ok?So I moved it up.Look, they take the velocity also.Now this curve will be downwards.This way.Ok?Right?And imagine this, which is r, isn't the radius, if it was r i.e. the region was completely filled with b, then that much circular motion it would have done, then it is only r/2 brother, so if you think hypothetically, this would have been the center of the circular motion, then this wood would have been the center of the circular motion, this would have been complete r and by taking this much radius, you can put a curve.So the curve will look like this.It will get a curve like this with center value.Ok?Yes.This will also be yours.This daughter's length is not drawn to scale, brother.This is also r/2.This will be complete r.So all these radii are r.So he is asking about the acceleration there.The acceleration will be v² / r and will point in this direction.Direction of acceleration would be like this.A
And magnitude of acceleration would be q qvb/m only.That cannot be changed.Only direction is rotating, right?So that's why qv/m is out in the sub options.All you have to do is judge the unit vector in that direction.So if this is theta, you are looking at a right angle triangle here r / 2 and r then the value of that theta will be 60°.And that means it's 30°, brother.And because this is the rightward x axis and this is the y axis.So we took z out.So its unit vector is pointing in the third quadrant.Third Quadrant i.e. i cap and j cap both should be negative.So there is only one option in this, brother.With both negative.No, it's not that either, friend.It's minus outside.See I was doing wrong.This is right?Yes.Right.This is what will happen.You check.This - cos 30 i cap and -sin 30 j cap is only one option so I marked it confidently.If there were two minus options, cos would be 30 3/2 and sin would be 30 1/2.Minus is out.Look okay?Let us also ask time taken in future questions.You know, if the entire time period is 2π / omega and it is rotating only by 60°, then it is rotating by π / 3 and it has to be divided by omega.So time taken also they can ask and which is very easy.You have to find the angle of the pink curve and from there you can also calculate the time because it is a uniform circular motion.ok right?Do this one with a pause.Came in my exam.This used to be screening in our time.Screening means yours is Mains and Advanced, our JE Mains was called A Triple E.That was a different exam.There was no relation of advance.In our time, there used to be an objective exam in December and the children used to spin there and that result used to come in December or January. The first result was there to know who would actually write the advance which used to be a subjective paper. In April and May, this screening came in the objective paper. At that time, there is a similar question which we just saw the PYQ of Mains. No, yes, don't ask whether I did it or not, I don't remember.I might have done it, but if I didn't do it at that time, it doesn't matter.Later I got a good rank.Ok?Yes.read off?done?2 minutes.I'm assuming you've done it.I'm going ahead.Particle of mass m and charge q moves with constant velocity v again along positive x direction.Like it happened in the last problem.If there is a region containing a uniform magnetic field directed along negative x z direction.This time inside the board, it is extending from x = a toYour region is x = a.This is x = b brother.So the width between the two, b - a, is important for later calculations.So the width b - a and it's entering in the positive x direction.So Towards is entering right.And remember the magnetic field is inside the board this time.Only in this.Here b = 0 and here also b = 0.There are no fields here.Only inside it.So imagine entering somewhere below.So get it entered like this.He is entering like this.If there is no magnetic field anywhere.This straight would go like this.Right?Now look at V cross B and see that V is rightward B is like this, if there is right hand thumb rule then it will curve upwards like this and if you have to enter in this region, then if its radius is small then it will curve like this, imagine if one radius is small then it will come in from here, if the radius is big then still it will come through this.Your radius should be such that neither the ankles touch it.This is a critical case.Even here I didn't think he would come back.So if the radius is a little more than this then it will enter that region.So, to visualize the semi-circles I have drawn in different cases, their radius should be B - A.And their radius should be more than B - A.So I remove these pink visualizations and put only one visualization that we need a situation like this, just this should come out.
This will be the radius of the semi circle, this is also r, this is also r, this is also r, this one r should be strictly greater than b - a Okay, this is the condition for you to enter the region, otherwise it will curve and enter it, you want to go there, you already know the formula of radius, mv / bq, you want mv / bq > b - a, this was the answer, then v should beB minimum bq / m * b - a Where is that visible?Yes, I can see option B.It's okay.Let's go next.Ok.A particle of positive charge q and mass m enters with velocity vj at the origin in a magnetic field.It's back to the board again.I will consider the board as an xy plane in my mind.So in the board it is present in the whole space.This time Na is not in the region.The entire space is filled with magnetic fields.The charge makes a perfectly inelastic collision with an identical particle at rest.Identical particle means mass is same, charge is also same brother.Don't forget to charge.But free to move at its maximum y coordinate.Whatever curve he was doing, the first particle collided at its maximum y coordinate and both stuck to each other.Perfectly elastic collision.After the collision the combined charge will move on a trajectory.It is a simple question.Yes, diagram has to be inserted.If you don't include a diagram, it is not simple.This is a good JE Advanced level question.I'm assuming you tried it.I am trying to insert a diagram.So at the origin J is entering in the cap direction.Right?So visualize it like this and not velocity it like this.Was going like this.Nice.Move it here and there a little.Why did I move in that direction?I tell you.Velocity is like this isn't it?And B is bar into the board.So in which direction will VB come?Think about it.B is bar in to the board.So V cross B is taking a leftward turn like this, right?This is a car.If you have to take a left turn then the curve will be like this.So that's why I left space here because I have to draw the circle on this side.Ok?So obviously it will curve like this.I have already told you when it is at its maximum y coordinate.This is the y axis for me and this is the x-axis.So at the maximum y coordinate we will collide with the other particle.So what will happen?Now what will be its velocity which is mv and what will be its momentum which is mv I think it will be transformed.Suppose its charge was also q.Now let us see what this particle will become?So this will convert to now a new particle whose mass is 2m velocity will become v/2 and charge will become 2q is this understandable?If both stick, the charge and mass will double.Due to momentum conservation the velocity will be halved at that instant.So now the radius which is R is new, which is R is new, which is R old, which is R, this is R, this is old radius, brother, they have written the answers in its reference, this is the old radius, so I will dip it like this, this is the center, this is the center of the old one and this is the dip of the radius of the old one, see this R is ok, now what will you write in R new, this is the same formula, you have to double the mass, you have to double the charge, both these doubles will cancel out butDue to the halving of velocity, this whole number will be halved. You understand right, so r new comes out to be equal to half of that radius. Okay, and this came from the fact that you put this in this formula.Correct?So from that particular position if it is half the radius then this becomes its diameter.So what I am seeing is that the circle will look like this.Let's put the circle in pink color.So from there the circle will look like this with this edge diameter visible.So write down the points brother.This is 0.This is in the negative x direction.So this -r 0 is your center which is in the second quadrant.So -r r/2 and halve the radius.So this is a circle with center edge -r r/2 and radius r/2 so you have to search in that.This is wrong.This is also wrong.This should be r -r r / 2.This is reverse right?This will be the answer.This is the mathematical equation of the pink circle.Ok?Done, we applied momentum conservation, applied the principle of inelastic collision, which is mv/bq, its expression is written directly, so two three concepts are involved in this question, it is a good question, not too tough, if you practice properly and go in the exam, these are the type of questions and Kamli, you have to do this in the exam. Okay, let's move ahead now.
So far, what you have done is that you have given velocity to a particle in the plane in which the magnetic field is perpendicular.That means you gave velocity perpendicular to B.Imagine that the particle was making circles in the same plane where the magnetic field is perpendicular.By chance you gave another component of velocity which is parallel to the magnetic field.So what will he do?While circling, the velocity will move forward in the direction parallel to the magnetic field.Right?Because velocity which is parallel to magnetic field it cannot change.Magnetic field cannot act on parallel velocity because of cross product.So if you give a parallel component like this unchanged, it will go away.So what kind of motion will you see?You will see a circle but moving in the third dimension in the direction of the magnetic field which is the axis and that is the helix.Now look at this description, which is perpendicular to the magnetic field, whenever you give a velocity, a circle will appear like this, horizontally, but a parallel velocity is also given, isn't this v subscript parallel, so you have to extend such a circle further like this, isn't this the above description, so whatever is the perpendicular component of the magnetic field, it will form a circle and the parallel component which is this green color, isn't it?He will take it forward like this Uniform in Helix In Helix, a uniform pitch is especially required in the calculation.End radius will determine only V perpendicular.The radius will then decide V perpendicular.And the time period itself will not depend on V.You know you wrote 2 M / B, then how far this V parallel takes it in a time period, that will be the pitch.It's a simple thing, friend.Is it clear?So the velocity component perpendicular to the field causes circling.That said, which is stretched upward by parallel components.They stretch i.e. are treating it like a spring.Hence the word stretched is used.Ok?Right?So, two calculations that we will do.The value of radius of cross section is given by MV perpendicular / bq.Obviously, time period is independent of both the components.It will always be 2pm/bq.For a circle and whatever is the pitch, it will become v parallel * t, then substitute t here, it will become v parallel multiplied by 2pm / v. You will have to do these three calculations whenever you will be asked questions in helical motion.So this one was an obvious thing.You can also write Omega.This is the value of pitch.Pitch is the distance between two successive turns.We also saw this in screw gauge.Pitch of a screw gauge.Same pitch here.So when will helical paths occur?Helical Path Happens?When we have both parallel and perpendicular components to B, we have seen this in the previous questions in the previous slides, if only perpendicular component was also of B, then only circle would come. If we superpose the parallel component extra on it, then helical path would come.Ok?Dunn.Let's move ahead.I took a question from the exemplar on helical motion.See, one more than one can be correct.Try pausing for 2 minutes.Properly check all four options and then proceed further.Ok?Let me solve it for you.I'm assuming you've done the attempt.Two charged particles traverse identical helical paths in a completely opposite sense.What does sense mean?When you see a helix being formed, you see it in axial view, that is, looking along the axis i.e. axial view.So when you look at it you can see two things.One clockwise and one anticlockwise.This makes sense.So, what he is saying is that the paths that those two particles are taking are identical.But if one is rotating clockwise, then the other one is rotating anti-clockwise.See it's a 3D motion.So if you want to see the spring clockwise and anti-clockwise, then you cannot see the spring by standing at a distance like this.So you have to look in the direction of that diameter axis.And then you will see its circle.It has a projected motion circle.When you look along the axis it is saying clockwise anticlockwise sense.So, if you have to rotate the same magnetic field in the opposition sense, then the force on it will be due to q * v perpendicular only.Right?Force is applied parallel to V
not can.Ok?Yes.So their radius also has to be same.So when you write radius mv perpendicular / bq is it ok?So if the radius has to be the same, B also has to be the same.So the only way this object sense can come is remember it is the same magnitude wise they have also given the same.Ok?And it should be the reverse.This this V perpendicular should be negative of each other.Only then can you say that both are going in the opposite direction.Haynes is the opposite.Is negative.Should I write it properly?This is negative.So the only way this can have the same value with this being negative is that the value of this m/q is not the same but equal but opposite.Ok?This is how you have to analyze.When will end equal and oppose?The month is not the sign of the month.But I think q/m is called specific charge rather than specific charge.Right?So the value of that q/m should be having opposite sign.So let's look at the options one by one.They have equal z components of momenta.They have equal z components of momenta.So v parallels must be equal.Two particles.Mass is not the same.You don't even know anything, right?Mass is also not the same.v Parallel we don't know anything.So and if one is rotating in clockwise like this and its mass if different V parallel be same I don't think moment can be same so there is no need ok mass may be different neither momentum can be different with same velocity so you will not mark a they must have equal charges again same logic your m/q and q/m ratio should be same.There is no need that m and q be the same individually.So this is also wrong.If you are saying must then don't say must.If I had told you, we would have accepted it respectfully.Yes.They necessarily represent a particle anti-particle player.That means if there is a positron then the electron antiparticles are the same.Same mass different charge.Again you cannot say the equivalence of mass.It could also be like It Could Be 42 vs. What Should I Write?2H1 This can also happen, right?Now see mass by charge mass by charge is the same.These two anti particles are few.Yes.Make one negative.This deuterium is positively charged, isn't it?Take its minus anti deuterium.Even then it can happen.These two are not anti particles, right?Take anti deuterium and take an alpha particle.So necessarily representing this is also wrong.Why are you using force?Yes.The charge to mass ratio should satisfy.This should actually be q/m.Don't write e, friend.To understand his feelings.Ok?So he wanted to write q.I think then this is perfect.Ok?So the specific charge becomes variant for the radius calculation.The specific charge will be important in the radius calculation.Move forward.So, I told you more about charged particles motions in the beginning and in between, I will show you the playlist which you have to complete in the ending.So scroll down to the home page of this channel.You will find individual playlists of electromagnetism challenges.Today's lesson is in these two playlists, this Q * VB one is about forces and in the ending we will talk about Bioseva Law, Ampere's Law Magnetic Effects of Current, these are 9 + 8 17 videos.So in this first playlist you will find some good questions.Where there is magnetic field, electric field, Lorenz force and I have taught multiple methods in it.Rolling, Disc Analogy, all these are somewhat JE advanced level questions.This is the war series of Phase One, isn't it?So we'll do this again in Phase Two in our sessions in the pure advanced sessions.But some children want to have it read in advance.So I would suggest that you will find this thumbnail inside.I have effectively replaced gravity with an electric field.Right?So there are two methods.There are three methods.Actually there is a normal physics method which you will find in text books.Both are tricks.So if you extend that, there were two more videos in the homework of this particular video which were Individual Rolling Disc Analogy and Field Transmission Technique.You can see that we solved the same question in two different ways.Same thing you must see, first see the rolling disc in the sequence, it is from JE Advanced.Whether you know this field transformation technique or not, even if it is advanced, you must
Will not be required.But if it comes then it will be very easy for you to solve the question.Please take a look.These are very good videos.Let's move ahead.Yes.Next.We have seen what is the Q*VB magnetic force on a moving charge.Now we will see that the moving charges are generally present inside the current carrying wires also.What is meant by current?We have seen in electricity that due to drift velocity the charges which move inside the wire are not visible to the naked eye.In the beginning, what you are seeing from above will not be visible microscopically.But there are movements inside.If you apply a magnetic field on them, then F will happen on them.If there is a force on the charges, then it will also apply force on the wire cover above it.So we will call that force ampere force from now on.There is a name for this magnetic force on current element is called ampere force.And its calculation is simple.This is an extension of Q*V.And I = NAVD which we applied in current electricity, you will combine both of them, then any current element is small. If the big wire is such a curve, then take one small element from it, which is the current element vector. You will write it as idl bar. If it is not a current vector, then you will take the help of dl bar. Okay, so this is called current element vector. This is the current element vector. See this and above that.Don't say ampere force it experiences a magnetic force.Tell me ampere force.Magnetic forces cannot work.But ampere forces can work.We will see going forward.So this is the value on each small element.If you keep many such small elements in a straight line.There is a straight wire so you have to integrate it.And if there is uniform field then B will come out.i will also come out.Integral DL Bar Will Become L Bar.But if it is curved like this.Imagine.Will tell you properly in the next slide.Like this, this is this which is Eros, like this, like this, like this, so again when you integrate this, if it is a uniform field, imagine if it is a uniform field, then when b comes out, here again i * dl bar crossed b bar will come, so your l bar will not be that won't be the length of this thing but rather that l bar will be like the displacement, this is your l bar right which is the pink color vector, won't it be yours.Ok?So, when you loop any wire, that is, you join the ends.You place it in a uniform magnetic field.There are usually only current carrying loops.So in that, this L bar becomes zero.So the ampere force on a current carrying loop is zero.When?In the uniform field.If this field is uniform then this is for uniform field.I will write completely in the next slide.I just wanted to so if the uniform field is b times then you can do this.If there is no uniform field then it will have to be integrated.The function of b will be given.So it will remain inside that integral.You will write that function and then integrate it.This fetch logic will be only for UNIF fields.Ok?Let us write the same thing in detail.Just want to show a lot more animations before I write.But in Current Elysee, it was shown and encouraged you that the entire second year studies are in order to get a feel because in second year physics, neither the fields are much nor the fields are visible, you must like the animations, you can do a little better imagination through it, if you have good text books like foreign author editions or those resnikde colored versions, there will be pictures in it, but if this particular JV labChawal App's website has a wonderful collection of visualizations of electricity and magnetism.You can see here they closed a circuit from the road.So when you correct the voltage the current will flow like this.So if you look inward from here, the road will look like a point.Right?The end is inside a magnet so the magnetic field will act on the current in that end.We had said that the magnetic field will be in the direction from North to South.So when I is inside and B is like this, your calculation will be IDL bar and IL bar, because of that the force will come to this pink vector.Because look, IL is bar into the board and B is like this, so the cross product will obviously be left or right.so to feel that
You can use the applet.I'll show you just once.You can explore the rest because I have to complete the session in four hours, so I cannot show everything.So just like that, yes, these are all the different topics of current electricity.Also of chemistry.You can explore.If you go into electricity-magnetism, you will find the Lorenz force that I was showing here.Look at this, if you want to show only current then it is visible inside the board.So this is the current's own magnetic field lines.And this is the magnetic field lines of the only magnet.The interaction between current and magnetic field is like this.You can see that this field is almost pushing it backwards.It is the visualization of your bil force.You can also switch the magnetic fields and the force will be reversed.Right?If you want to see the field lines, you can see the field lines.If you want to see more such vectors then you can see the vectors.It is also showing individual vectors properly.Right metal road, this is the road, you are seeing it from inside, this is the road, so you can also run it, switch the two poles, reverse DIL force, reverse, just want to show it, then note it down, explore it, there are many more experiments in it, we have finalized what I wrote in the previous slide, that it is for uniform field, that's what I write here.So this is for uniform field.If the field is uniform then this will apply.You can bring B out only then, right?Yes.If B is not uniform.I told you that you will have to do integration.So let's take an example.There is a curved conductor through which current is flowing.So what will be the total ampere force on it?So write ampere f.So take the same starting point and ending point.It doesn't matter what the curve is.What is the distance of the starting and ending points?This is L.This is 2R.So L + 2R total length.Current multiplied by B, this is your answer, just one step, yes, just check whether the magnetic field is in or out of the board, i.e. perpendicular to the length of L, if it is, then direct cross product will be produced, otherwise you will have to write a sin theta also. Okay, yes, I told you one more thing, in the same notes, I had to give it, let me move it a little higher for a second. Yes, everything is visible now, isn't it?Yes.Yes.Look at this.If there was a closed loop and a uniform magnetic field, I keep on reminding you there was a uniform magnetic field so that it could come out of integration.Then the magnetic force will become zero.But the net force above it is zero.But the force vectors you add may have a rotation effect.For example, two act like a force couple on a road.Net profit will be zero.The center of mass will remain fixed but can rotate.There may be rotation effects on it.So that is why it is written here that torque may not be zero.Ok?So we will study those torque effects from a different concept later.Try this one more question on Ampere Force from NCRT Exemplar.Consider a wire carrying a current and study current.That means the current is not moving from time to time.Placed in a uniform magnetic field B perpendicular to its length.They set that B is perpendicular to length, brother.Consider the Charges Inside the Wire.It is known that magnetic forces do not work.Remember Q * VB force is called magnetic force.That will never work because you know its dot product with V will be zero.This implies that the road is moving due to the BL force that you saw in the simulation.When you switched it on, this road was moving like this, hence BL force is moving it.So he is working.The work of BL force is not the work of QB force.This is the most important point.Ok?So from his perspective you have to find options here.So let's read together one by one.Motion of charges inside the conductor is unaffected by B since they do not absorb energy.This is wrong brother.They cannot increase kinetic energy.Will not work.But it will curve them, right?So these curves can eventually come to the surface.They may be deflected.So motion will be the effect.speed will not change
.So unaffected this is wrong.This unaffected part is wrong.So, this option is wrong.Some charges inside the wire move to the surface as a result of B.This is what can happen.You are actually deflected by a straight going magnetic field, so it may come above or below the surface.It actually has an effect.This is called Hall effect.In Electromagnetic Induction we will read it in a more descriptive manner.Ok?Right?So this is correct.If the wire moves under the influence of B no work is done by the force.This is a little tricky.The F is not magnetic.If you say magnetic field then it will not work.So here I took the liberty of correcting this.And in case you get such options in the exam, then they do not mean magnetic field.Magnetic field is written separately.If not written, that is your ampere f and ampere f is that BL f.That does work.And later in the EMI chapter you will see that this is not a BL force, it is a back EMF of electromagnetic induction.If you have not read that chapter yet, wait till then.We will prove this in another way there.Ok?This is not BQV force yet.Q*VB is not a force.Ok?Right?So, this would be PL force does work.Indirectly, actually the source which is maintaining the current. Previous again, I will go to the simulation. This is the source, nor is it maintaining the current. When this road was moving, right inside this field, it is trying to maintain the current. So this is the source, nor is it indirectly doing the work. Actually, without that source, you cannot maintain that velocity.The right source actually does the work, that is what we call BAL force.If you take the entire system, how much system will you take, if you include the source battery of the circuit, then you will say that the source is working.If you insert free body diagram of only road then BAL will work on it.So that should be very-very clear.Then BL force will become internal force that makes sense.Ok?So option C is correct from that point of view if it is ampere F.So if you read D then you will understand what is the difference between C and D.If the wire moves under the influence of B, no work is done by the magnetic force on the ions assumed fixed with in the wire.Yes.If the velocity of these ions is fixed above it is zero then the force is zero, which means the work is also zero.Ok?If the wire moves under the influence of B, no work is done by magnetic force on the ions.This is correct.It will not work not only on ions but even on moving charges.Magnetic force never works.This is not happening because of this.Magnetic forces do not work on the charges which are moving due to Q*V.Ok?So B C D would be the appropriate answer.Let's see these questions.A bit calculative.Yes.Such calculative questions have reduced in Mains.But I feel that this year when there was a ruckus, when NEET paper becomes tough then all of them will try to change the face value of Physics in Mains, this is my expectation from NTA.There is a prediction.Ok?Be ready.If you are preparing well then you would want the Physics paper to be a little tough so that the children who are studying seriously should have some respect for them.If you give any simple formula based paper in Mains, then even the advanced ones give good papers.Physics is tough.So if that gap is reduced a little then it is good for you too for your coaching and your preparation.So these questions come under that scope.So good questions were there in the old papers.Read the question.Take 2-3 minutes then go ahead and pause till now I understand that you have attempted I am going ahead ok a conductor lies along z axis z axis is in direction and carries a fixed current of 10 ampere in a - Az cap direction for a field 3 * 10 power -4 this is non uniform field brother varying with position find the powerRequired to move to the conductor at a constant speed from
L will be the power of force and its power will also be the same.So indirectly you are supposed to calculate the power of BL force which is multiplied by V.So the problem here is that B is non-uniform.So Power Required to Move at a Constant Speed ​​is said.So this should be average power right?Because B is not the same everywhere.So you should read this as average power required.This should be studied as average power.Because if it were instantaneous then there would be no numbers.That power was position based.So rejecting this formula, we will take average power.The value of average power comes out to be work done divided by time taken.Ok?So how much is the work brother?Integration of force times dx and force is a position based force.Ok?So dil*dx/time take.Ok?So in this no you cannot bring out b.You have to integrate E.I&L will come out.Look at the length, this is the entire length from -1.5 to +1.5.It is 3 meters long.Three will come out.How much current have you given brother?10 then 3 and 10 will come out saying 30.And how much time is taken?There is constant velocity motion.What is constant velocity?Yes.He has already given time.So we have to directly substitute 5 * 10 power-3. These are weighted out for the end of our integration.Ok?So bring out this whole 3*10 power-4 also.Only give this function will remain inside.So write out 3*10 power-4 even before you write the integration.Your integral is weighing inside.So e power -2x * dxThree and four in between.So you don't have to come up with exact values ​​because e is some dirty integration of powers.So when you integrate, this two will come down.Right?And when two comes down, I see this whole power of 10 and 9 * something.Ok?And 1 - e power - 4 is coming so you guys can solve it right this is 10 power - 1.Right?End is 10.So it's gone, you will write 9/5.Ok?You will write 9/5 * 1 - not 9/5, 2 will also come down, neither will nor will that, this 2 will also come down, 5 *2 is 1, neither is five, only nine is gone, nine is alone, poor guy, now it is 9 * 1 - e power-4, I have substituted him here, now na e power-4, they have not given him at all.So you have to write the x expansion of e power.So this is approximately 9 * 1 - 1 -4 This is e power - x 1 - x + x² / 2 That is plus some more terms.Will write that later just for calculation.Ok?I have taken extension.So this 1 - 1 minus gets cancelled.If we take 4 then something like 3.6 is coming.But it has to be less than 3.6.Slightly less because the next terms will be less than Na4.So not much less, a little less.So in my mindset the value should be a little less than 3.6 and this should be there in the answer exam.So this is the most appropriate answer among the options.If they had given 2.97 and 3.06 I would have been stuck.I will have to calculate better.One more term will have to be written.So this is the smartness you need to have in the exam.Ok?The ones that keep the toppers.Asking questions will obviously take you here if you have good coaching.But how to get marks from here?You have to develop this little smartness with good practice.Ok?So this is an appropriate answer among the options.Ok?Check the answer.I feel like I did the right thing.It's done.Let us look at this question.I must come back to this.Actually I have not yet read how much is the magnetic field due to the current carrying wire.So, as we had shown in the first slide, when there is a current carrying wire, if you hold it like this, the magnetic field lines will appear like this.So the field that will be caused by this magnetic field will be in towards the board, here it will become smaller as it goes further away.The field will become smaller.This is not a uniform field.So because in this direction this will become weaker field.This will become a weaker field.The current carrying I is not a uniform field.Wicker Field.So the ideal bar which will cross B bar will be downwards.Right?
Force.Look at this I'm on this side of it.The magnetic field is perpendicular to the board.Right?So the ideal bar cross is below B bar.But all the forces which are DF forces will not be equally strong.However, the forces which are closer to this point will be stronger.So, I have put the distribution of force for your convenience and it will become smaller in reaching here.So if you have to represent this and this will also be in 1/x form.It won't be linear like this.Ok?So just assume that it will be smaller by the time you get here.Non-uniformly distributed i.e. stiffer forces on this side. When you pull a road with equal forces on the right side and the left side, then it will only translate and will not rotate. But here you can see the rotation effect. It is trying to rotate anti-clockwise. Its right end, which will have its center of force on the left side of C, its torque will become zero.Right?So the point at which the conductor should be hinged.So that it will not rotate.It will not rotate where the torque on left side and right side cancels.If you put it on C then AC will dominate.So don't put it on C.There will be a point marked D somewhere here because there is a stronger force on this side.So the center of force lies here.So if you pinch there then this road will not rotate.So somewhere between A and C is the appropriate.This question was to come at the end of the slides.I made a mistake in some of the ordering of the questions.Yes.But I explained that we will derive its formula later in this session.Ok?Right?The field caused by a current carrying wire reduces as it moves away.That much should be known in this question.Ok.Let's move ahead.We are next a small topic.Questions keep coming on this.Right?So to get it done quickly, I wrote everything down on a single page.Cyclotron holds very important significance. Both importance and significance are same words.What matters is whatever developments are taking place in particle physics right now, the Large Hydron Collider, where we smash particles and try to discover new particles. For the progress of physics and in the last few decades, many Nobel Prizes have also been awarded for that particular research.So its origin is to accelerate the particles because nothing good is done by smashing them, that fire works.Not the Diwali type.Physicists enjoy smashing particles.New particles should be visible so that the subject can be taken forward.So particle accelerators become very important for observations.Accelerating torch particles becomes a basic thing.So the oldest apparatus in it is the cyclotron.Right?So what happens in a cyclotron is that you will use both magnetic and electric fields.And there are two semi circles which are called Dees.Semi circles are called Dees.And obviously the name is because it looks like the letter D, not semi circles so they are called dees.This name is D double E.So when you apply a magnetic field inside the board, the magnetic field is perpendicular to it either in to the board or out of the board.And you will apply an electric field inside this small gap that you have left.So when the particles come into the gap, they will increase their speed due to the electric field and after increasing the speed, when they come under the influence of the magnetic field, they will go in a circular motion.When you notice r = mv / bq, the one which has higher v will have larger radius.So every time they accelerate due to the electric field in the gap, they move in a longer circle.And they increase the speed again in a circle again in each cycle the electric field will be responsible for increasing the speed.But there is a small thing here.If you take the electric field in the same direction, then imagine a uniform electric field applied in this gap.Think about it.Ok?So what will happen because of that?When you are going upward from late, you accelerated it but after coming here, if the electric field is still acting upward then it will decelerate it.So you need such apparatus when the particle comes
When Dha completes the circle, the electric field will also reverse its value.So this will actually happen by applying voltage.Voltage will produce an electric field.So you have to reverse the voltage.That's where they will use this AC AC alternating current or alternating voltage, which is square type, the magnitude of the electric field is the same but its direction will be reverse.Its time period and the time period of this circular motion should be the same.These should be in sync.Therefore, when the cyclotron was developed later, it was also called synchrotron.So electric and magnetic fields will remain in sync.So the time period which will be 2m / bq that should be the time period of this function so that this AC signal keeps on accelerating.Ok?So all these pictures are different views.This is called perspective view.You are looking at it from an agricultural perspective.When seen from above it will look like this.And when you look from the side through such a gap, it will look like this.And you could see that the gap is electric and the electric field will accelerate.And when the magnetic field goes into the DJ, there will be magnetic poles at the bottom and top, because of that the magnetic field is showing it like this.This B is like this in this view.Ok?If you want to read a proper theory about it, Reznik is Hilde Walker.There is only one page in it.Right?When you download this slide, read the text from there once and you will understand what I am saying.I have taken these questions from the NCERT exam. Whatever I have just explained, you have seen that there is the significance of the electric field and the significance of the magnetic field.Ok so again it is a 1 minute question.Take a pause, give your attempt and then see my explanation.I am studying.In a cyclotron we see a charged particle undergoing acceleration all the time.OK and speeds up between the two because of the magnetic field.This is wrong.This should be due to the electric field.Speeds up magnetic field can never create speed.This will be electric field.So this is wrong right?The magnetic field speeds up in the d.There is no speed up in D.There is a bend in D, right?There is no magnetic field, it is speeded up in the gap.There should be this gap.Ok?Closes down with in the D and speeds up between the D's.This is also wrong.He is blabbering anything inappropriate.Ok?So this is wrong.Undergoes acceleration all.If you ask sir, it is happening in the gap.D is accelerating a little.Acceleration is a vector.So in D the speed is not increasing but the curve is happening so there is acceleration because of that the most appropriate answer among the B CD is wrong then this acceleration is a vector in that case you can say that the speed is increasing in the gap and is making a curve in the seed i.e. the direction of the velocity of speed is changing so the acceleration is done let's do one moreQuestions which I expect to come in JE Advanced someday.Right, its slightly higher level version is also available in Irdo.I have made its video on Already Physics Sir ji's YouTube channel.I will show you the thumbnail which is shown in the beginning of your playlist.So after doing these questions, after the session is completed, do the questions of that Cyclotron also.Ok?Ok?Read now for 2 minutes.There are many questions.There are three parts in it.A very good passage question that it can become either in Mains or Advanced.So whatever your AC source is, there will be electric fields in the gap.The magnetic field will always be perpendicular to D.Have to bend.So he has made a question on that.Watch A proton circulates in a cyclotron beginning approximately at rest at the center.Which is in the center, right in the gap, the electric field at rest will first accelerate and then reach D, then it will hit a semi circle, then come into the gap, accelerate a big semi circle in the second D, similarly alternating, whenever it passes through the gap between the Dees, look at the spelling of Dees, this is its shape, the letter is D, so Dees, he said the electric potential difference between the Dees, this is 200Volt.This source is providing 200 volt function.Positive 200 and negative 200.How much does it's Kinetic A
Energy Increases with the Passage to the Gap.This is a very easy question isn't it?The charge of the proton is E and when it passes through a voltage its delta becomes KE.This is what E times V is, isn't it?Charge*Voltage Is Energy.And you can write that in electron volts.Right?This 200 V * E is 200 electron volts.So in an easy way to write the unit of electron volt that has been invented.So let me write directly, it is 200 electron volts.So every time this electron goes into the gap the kinetic energy will increase by 200 volts.If n times go n times this thing will be the increase in kinetic energy.Ok?If it would have been charged two times, it would have been charged two times. It would have been 400V. If a proton had been given, it would have been easy. If an alpha particle had been given, then I would have multiplied it with two times. Look at the second question from here, what is its kinetic energy as it completes 100 passes. Oh man, it is easy. Even the second question is easy to give, so here I will write B, there I will write P.Third good question, so 100 passes implies 100 times of that which is 200 eV of each pass. It has increased so much, now we do the third one, let R 100 b the radius of the protons circular path as it completes two 100 passes and enters a D let R 1001 b b the next radius i.e. after 100 path a circle will come.And after 11 passes a slightly larger circle will appear.So the radius of the circle will keep increasing like a spiral.Not a spiral.This semi circle is discrete.Each curve is a semicircle and its radius is increasing.Like it happens in the market, your hydrogen r is proportional to n² there.Here also r is proportional to n something.Ok?We Have to Find That.So he is saying that this percentage has been increased from 10001 to 100.So if I can get that r proportional to that number of nth passages I'm done with this calculation.So for that, first we make a relation between radius and kinetic energy.We know the radius and momentum is r = mv / vq.And mv is momentum.We can write momentum as the square root of 2 times mass * ke.The increase of P²/2m kinetic energy and etch is proportional to the number of passes.So you can say that the KE you wrote is proportional to N.And there you can see that r nicely comes out to be proportional to square n.This is a very important relationship.In the force model r is proportional to the lens squared.Here n power is 1/2 brother.It is visible.That's why first two questions have been done.He built up and made you understand.Then asking tough questions.Done.So it's because it's the ratio.There is no need for a proportionality constant.So when you hit the ratio 111 /100 - 1 * 100.So 111 / 100 which is the percentage ratio, this one will become square root 1 / 100 - 1 * 100 you have to find.Now if JE people give you options in the question then you will solve it according to the options.In options decimal places, you have to actually calculate in third and fourth decimal places.But I think you can do a binomial approximation in this.These two numbers are very close.So look at this, you must have done this many times in other topics.This is it right?So 1 + a very small number.1/100 is small compared to one whole power 1/2, you can do this 1 + 1/2 times.Right?So this is approximately 1 + this is the power of 1/2, I have multiplied it by -1. If you want to get a more accurate answer, then this is the binomial expansion of 1 + x power of 1/2, not your fractional power.Add the third term also.Add the fourth term also.Depends how many options there are.So I'm thinking of putting it down to the second term.This one and one got cancelled.So according to me it is around 5%.Look at this, 100 and 100, it will be cancelled.These 5 and if this were one more term then it would be a little bigger.Ok?So approximately there will be 5% increase from 1 to 100.It's done.This is a good question.Nice Candidate for your JE Advanced Exam.And Erdos Sir has given a very good question on this Route 10.I have created its solution.I myself had given this in NIITS long ago.And but that was not the original question.That is from Irdo question.If you go inside this video then I
I also give the source of Iredo.There are two parts in it.One is time spent by ion.We already calculated the radius in the previous question.In this question time has to be calculated.You will know the time.And his other question is a good distance traveled and a very good discrete series will come which they convert into a continuous series.In Irido, only key is given on the back side.Answer solutions are not given.But for that question, Rado sir must have thought it was a very good question.So he gave a suction which is rare.Redo Sir Ke Back Side Pe Book Pe You Will Not Have Solutions But This Question Has It.So in this whole playlist, this one is a good question about cyclotron.I am expecting this question from the last four five years.It will be a hit someday.I keep waiting for many such questions, I was waiting for the Garromagnetic Ratio for 10 years, it is coming in 2025, do it like this and if there is doubt in this video, then put a time stamp below the same video, as you will see, I give the answer right there, I give the doubt of this session, below the video of this session, you put the time stamp, it is important wherever you are, the next topic is torque.On a current loop.We have already seen that if a current loop is applied in a uniform field, it will not exert any force.Loop, we have brought force from BL, he will not apply force.Right?But torque can come.Rotating effect may occur.So we are calculating for that.This time took a loop just like that.Right?And we have taken an in-board magnetic field and are trying to understand it.So the first time you do this in a planar way, all these forces will cancel out on each side, on the rectangle side and there will be no rotation effect on top of that.But, tilt it a little.Because I can't show in this diagram.It tilts.So, let's look at this a little from the side.This is the side view.We tilted the magnetic field a little and made it visible only on one side.So we are looking at it from the side by tilting it.That is, the F1 bar which is there looks like this.So this dot is the entire side.And this F3 time will obviously be his exit.But there is a gap between these two.See.So this f1 bar and this f3 bar now cancel equal and object they are creating a couple torque see or and this torque will not depend on this angle and to define that angle I will take a normal vector to the plane which is a planar loop, it does not have a direction but its area has a direction.Right?Just like we did in Gauss Law, we will take the direction of a normal vector and the torque is a vector. Right and you want to write this formula in the form of a cross product with the magnetic field which is a normal thing. Any calculation in this chapter, the involved cross product of the magnetic field with the vector will be F, be the effect, be the torque, be whatever. Okay, so in this red direction, this is the normal to the loop.In this particular picture it will come out of the board or into the board.So for that also you will decide the direction as to whether the current is going clockwise or anti-clockwise, you will use the right hand thumb rule.So if it is clockwise then thumb into the board point out do that is your direction of your n times.Look here, the current is going like this, so you will make the normal direction like this.This current is also going in and coming out like this, so it is normal like this, so when you calculate the entire torque, such a term will come out that if you a * b is area right then you can write it as i * area * b * sin theta. The cross product is visible. If you name this i * a as a new vector and give the direction of this vector as right hand thumb rule.So that's what was written.If it were n terms then there would be n times calculations.So define n * i.So this n*i*a from nonwords is going to be called as magnetic dipole moment vector.Or you can simply call it dipole movement or you can remove this word dipole and call it magnetic moment.This is a vector.Its direction will be determined by right hand thumb rule.You will write this as μ.So when you write torque in vector form, μ times will be crossed by b times.This is similar to what we did in electrostatics.Elect
Rick Dipole Movement vector that gives torque Na P bars cross B bars exactly P bars E of that chapter and U bars B bars of this chapter same.Should be said similar and not same.Speak analogs.There are equivalent situations.Ok?So I am writing it in proper form in the next page.Look, we have determined the direction of μ bar by right hand thumb rule if the current is going in any such loop.You think like this, use your right hand only in the direction of the current.Ok?The direction of the term is given by μ times.Whatever is the area of ​​the end loop, if rectangle then length * width if circle then π * r² then this is your value of torque and this should imply this is μ times b * sinθ ok?And μ is always given by number of turns of the loop into current* area.The direction is given by the right hand thumb rule and the formula that you need to remember is similar to your P cross P is decreasing to μ And there also we defined a potential energy for this torque interaction.You will remember - P. by speaking.So with similar analogy here also the potential energy of interaction what does this loop want to do?Its normal is that its μ which always wants to go parallel to the B bar.It will rotate until it goes parallel.So that would be your stable equilibrium position.So like - P. Becomes the potential energy of interaction between electric dipole and electric field magnetic dipole and magnetic field in between.You can discuss like this.Let me do this a little.Yes.Now look it is visible.So this will be the derivation.This is the torque formula for you.This is the formula for potential energy.Minus isent.The lowest energy state is the stable energy state.So which will be the lowest energy state?Look at these two.When μ is exactly antiparallel it will have the highest energy because it will become positive.I am saying the right thing.And when it is actually μ parallel, this is the stable state of B because the energy is negative.Less Energy More Stable.Ok?Now look at a rectangular loop of sides 10 cm.And 5 cm.Caring.They are getting you checked for stable and unstable equilibrium.It's a simple question, friend.Take a look.They have given the uniform field.I move away.Try pausing for a minute or two and then do it.I assume you paused.Tried, I am going ahead.Ok?Right?I have so much trust in you guys that you are serious, that is why you are watching my lectures.So write no in all these times.Right hand thumb rule will be practiced.Curl your fingers in the tense of current.The thumb will give you direction of μ bars.So in this μ times is out of the board.If it is going like this, it is in the negative y direction.Such is μ.Ok?Am I right?Yes.Negative y direction.Brother, both are perpendicular.When μ is perpendicular, that of B is the nether maximum energy nor is the minimum.That is the middle energy state.You need 0° or 180° not 90° for stable and unstable equilibrium.What was there here?Yes.μ parallel arrived.Look, it's coming like this, isn't it?μ Okay and the reverse is coming in this, man here anti parallel yes, we have got the letters stable and unstable, look at the letters I think B is stable and letter D option D looks unstable Table B and Table D so there are three, why are two marked, correct.Just a simple question.You had to look closely at the four options.Right hand curl had to be applied and the state function of potential energy, u - μ.B, had to be applied.Parallel is stable, anti-parallel is unstable.The same dipole moment is similar to the electric dipole moment.Look at this question.This mixed concept of rotation and which is your μB is not this μB is a couple remember couple is always independent of the axis.This is a hint.I am withdrawing.Take 2 minutes or 3 minutes.After pausing I can't pause the live session.Right?You can do it.Ok?So I am going ahead with this question.The wire is wrapped n = 10 times over a solid sphere of mass m = 5 kg Current of i = 2 amperes is flowing which is placed on a smooth surface.So these coils have many turns right and they are flowing current.So your answer to this particular question is μ, so you catch the ball.This is a cricket ball.It has a seam.You are holding it like this.So Tamb is making such a point.So I see the μ bar is upwards.These μ
Its time.So obviously μ wants to go in the direction of B.So μ has to be rotated like this, then this entire object will rotate like this.So, due to its tendency to rotate clockwise, it will try to roll rightward.When it wants to roll it will obviously want friction from the ground because there is no other force.Remember, even the μ cross cannot exert force.Only torque.But the center of mass will say I need acceleration.So the friction will act from here in the forward direction.And it's an obvious thing.You do not have to calculate this friction initially.There will be static friction.There is rolling motion.What is the question asking?Find the angular acceleration experienced by the spear.So if you want to write tau = alpha for angular acceleration, you have options.If you have done the rotation properly, you can also calculate and write the FS of the rolling motion from the center of mass.There is an important point in pure rolling.In pure rolling, this bottom point is called point at rest or ICR.Instantaneous center of rotation.Some people also speak of IAR as Instantaneous Axis of Rotation.Ok?The most important thing is that it is on point rest.So, from here you can write tau = I alpha.And remember, write tau from here or torque from here.The value of μx b is the same.The torque of a coupler is axis independent.This is a very basic thing when you do rotation.Ok?So if you write about ICR, you can avoid FS.So to avoid FS use tau = alpha about ICR which is written below, from there we write the wire so there is μ cross and μ cross here μ is also 90° then modulus of that μB should be equal to i * r so modulus is direct product here number of turns is 10 so should I write complete nab = iicr Which sphere is this brother solid is solid so about center of mass2/5 mr² about ICR 7/5 or sorry 7/5 mr² is right so this is 7/5 r² alpha has become in one step you have not even given value to fs, it has become alpha the value of alpha comes out to be which is 7 area is πr² neither r² is cut off brother so remove 7.Let's write first.Will it come this way? 5 will come up.n i π / 7 This is your answer.So pie will remain.Well, look, 20 nπ is given in the answer.So eliminate π.Remove 20 also.So this is 50.How much is given by 5 times n 50 i?2 Write out air i.And how much is b given?P is 10 and 7 times mass mass mass is 5 kg ok friend, I made a mistake in this, I think someone must have said in the chat that I made a mistake, again I was just studying, I assumed rolling, friend, now look, I have missed an important word, honestly it was my mistake but I am trying to correct it, given the smooth horizontal surface, this rolling is not possible at all.fs is zero brother.So I will correct this matter.Don't worry.So rolling is not possible.So there is no need to take ICR because it will not be ICR.That point will move.So this is not ICR because slipping is happening here.Since it is sleeping, we cannot say no to avoid fs this time.fs is not there.fs = 0 So use happily when ICR you don't know.You have to use it about center of mass.So make sure to forgive whatever mistake you made.It is good that both the questions were done.Even if the ICR question was pure rolling, it would still be correct.If he had been rolling the ball then he would have taken about ICR here.Now I have corrected it.This will become ICM*Alpha.Ok?So the only change would be beastly.I was having a little issue with intake because I had to come up with an inter integer answer.My mistake was that I did not read the entire question.So it became from to.Ok?And you see yes, this now reinforces our idea that when I wrote to ICR that there was a cross bi couple, I wrote this number.This number was also written from the center of mass.Yes, the moment of inertia changes but the calculation of torque remains the same because of the couple.So it's good that I made a mistake so that you can see that the torque is the same in both the positions.Alpha will change.So remove the intake here also.Put two.Now I can see.Ok?You have to keep 20 in your side.So 20, this part is 20. Instead of keeping 2 and 0 and 2 like this, I take this part. I am 20. Okay, yes, this is 20. 50 / 10 is five. The answer will now be correct. This and five is the
Answer: Ok, I removed the file, ok, that's a good thing.Not Not ICR Since It's Sleeping There For You You Have To Go Back To Your Center Of Mass.Ok?Very good question.Because of one word which is placed on said very rough if in the other question in future question very rough.Very rough mean rolling will happen.So rolling will happen.FS Will Be There.Since FS is there, this will be ICR About ICR This will be 7/5 There will be a change in the answer.Ok.Let's do this next question.A non conducting non magnetic road having square cross section of side l/4 its cross sectional side is a square l / 4 l/4 its own length is 2L.A light small coil of 600 turns is wrapped tightly at the left end of the road.He rapped here and there.I will give a break before starting the next sub topic.Don't Worry or 510 minutes.So a light and small coil of 600 turns is wrapped tightly at the left end of the road where uniform magnetic field exists.There is a magnetic field here only.Not here, on this side.Obviously the current in the coil will generate μ and a μ cross will also occur.Right?Yes.Because of that a tilting effect will occur.Ok?You must have read the question, take 2 minutes to 4 minutes and then pause it.Right?I'm assuming you did.I will move away at once.Take a pause.Read the question.Take complete inhalation.Ok?Let go.So the solution is that when this b and μ are like this then μ will try to tilt the cross b which is like this, there will be an effect on rotating it like this, so it wants to come down, this above, so to prevent it from coming up, you are pushing it downwards with air, which we do in fluids, neither of these, both the torques should be the same, if you have to keep the balance, that is the question, then what should be the current in the coil so that itThe torque that is hitting the air will be represented in a different colour.Its torque will be like this.These two torques, neither red nor yellow, have to be balanced.You know that whenever air hits some rest surface, the force applied will be thrust dm / dt * v.dm / dt * v and this dm / dt when hitting a cross sectional area will be ro av So will this force be ro² dm / dt is ro * v ro² And this is ro² na puri this is its area na I think there is a rectangular area you can see l / 2 is into the board l /4 is uniformly distributed on it.Whenever there is a uniformly distributed force, you place the entire force at its center position to calculate the torque.Like our roads are rotable.So mg is a distributed function.So where do you put it?You put it on its center, right?On the same logic, this row wave will be a square wave and you will place it exactly at its midpoint.So I will put the yellow color arrow here.So what will be its distance from the axis?Let me show it with a dotted line.This yellow color dotted line, dotted line, this one, this is l / 2 and one half of l / 2, what is l /2 + l /4?This force is felt at a distance of 3l/4.So if you want to write torque, this yellow one.This one should have been written as force * 3l/4.Ok?And that should be your red color μx, which is μB force, it will be the cross product because both are perpendicular, both of them will be equal.This is already torque brother.This is not his strength.This is already torque.Don't multiply anything by distance.Ok?There are already distances in it.So you have to complete the calculations.μ is ni into area.Area of ​​cross section is again this: You will write the area of ​​cross section from this side, l/4 hole square * b This should be nicely equal to that yellow colored one which is torque, what is its area, this upper area l /2 * l/4 its area is different.Its area is different.Don't write area and don't cancel, both sides.Ok?Yes.And there was also v².Again there was distance also.So write v² first.Then the distance became real by 4.This is your current question.Keep the current on this side.Send everything else in that direction by canceling.l² will be cancelled.Here two else will cancel.Ok?So this down 4² will cancel out.Here both fours will be cancelled.So this is complete.We removed it.So the value of current is equal to which is ro and 3/2 is left to me.3 rows/2
If one l is left then write l, b² is left and rest of the n and b will go down to party, this is the answer, you just have to substitute, oh ok yes, the numbers are looking good, don't be afraid of this, 1.05 will become 105.I think there will be some part of 15 table.So don't be afraid.This 1.5 is visible here, right?So write this on 3/2.Then write 1.05.What is the length brother?2 meters.What is p²?10² is 100.The number of turns seems to be 600 somewhere.Yes.600 turns.And he has also given magnetic field of 1 Tesla.This is what happened.Cancel both of them.These 100s are also gone.P/2 is 1/2.05 current in milliamperes.So this is an ampere.This is an ampere.Ok, you will definitely get it, 1.05/2 * 1000 milli ampere is 1000 Will take care of everything, friend, then it will be 1050 / 2, the answer should be 525. To get integer, I changed the units for your convenience, this is your pink answer, 525 is in integer, till this calculation, I wrote in ampere, write here.I am giving it so that you will not face any problem when you download the slides.These were SI units.In the next step I cancelled.Ok?Let's move ahead.Next Moving Coil Galvometer: We saw the working of moving meter in current electricity.We converted it into voltmeter ammeter.Problem solved.I also asked to PYQ some good questions of the playlist.You got a good DPP.Doubts also come and children ask in my Telegram group.If you are a new kid of Telegram group, all the links are pinned below in the comments.You will also find all the links in the comment and description.Please like all the ok rights and videos of DPP's Telegram group.I also said this in the beginning.I will remind again in the ending.A decent teacher should not remind.A good kid should remember how the YouTube algorithm works.So you do such good problems properly, it is a common sense thing that you support a good teacher.More good content will come, if you like it and the channel grows, then the management will think that such content should be delivered to you.So don't think that if I like it the competition will increase.So I won't like it.So content will not come.Only paid batches will run.Ok?Right?You think about yourself only.If it reaches more children then that is the luck factor.But it doesn't even reach you because likes are not coming.Let's assume views are not coming and obviously the content will be taken out.And We Will Divert Our Attention to Something Else.So whatever you are currently surviving on will stop.Think this much.Don't think ahead about what others will do if they see it.You wouldn't know how much interest the other one is watching.You are watching with interest.If you are liking the content, there should be more such content. If you want, please like it.There is only one like, please do it.Yes, please understand that we were there, we were not working, we were working.But we did not see how the principal would work.There it was told that you should think that current is proportional to theta.So the more it is deflected, the more current is passing.We accepted this and said that we will understand what is happening inside from the chapter on magnetism.So there is a horseshoe magnet inside, like this one, a curved one.Ok?And the curved part is very important.If it was a normal C type magnet.If C type magnets i.e. have plane surfaces then there would be uniform field.In uniform field, when current flows through a coil, the torque will become μB and μB will become μB sin theta.You don't want current to be proportional to sin theta.You want current to be proportional to theta.To achieve that, I took your diagram from NCRT.So to achieve that, your field should always become parallel to the plane.And that can happen only when the field is spiral.That curved part is important for the end spiral.So in this particular topic your torque magnitude will be uniform.Sin theta should not come here.And that is achieved by uniform radial magnetic field.It is important whether it is spiral or radial.They ask this theoretical question.And what do we do with that?
?Attached to a torsional spring.Like there is a linear spring to oppose linear motion.Like a torsional spring to oppose rotary motion.We do not use these in physical pendulums in 11th syllabus.So it is like f = kx.Here tau = cheta.c is the torsion constant per unit twist.You will equate these two factors.This and this equilibrium.Now see the current coming out is going to be proportional to theta.Do you understand?This is where your constant comes from.This is a constant. We had said that the figure of merit is a constant.That figure of merit is C by Bain.This is how I remember.C by ban.Yes or do NBA.NBA If some of you are fans of basketball, then NBA then this is the figure of merit.That which is constant is parallel.Its reverse is the current sensitivity Tata by tan / c is the current sensitivity galvometer. Okay, so this is visible from above, this pointer is inside this, this is the construction inside this pointer, here you can see some simple to tough questions which have already come in the exam.Till now we will see one for Mains and one for Advanced.I will give the rest to you in DPP.Again I move away.Try for 2 to 3 minutes.This will take 2 minutes.Understand numerical in question.Whenever such numbers are given approximately, you just have to calculate the order.No actual calculations are required.You should have so much smartness.Ok?Well, I think you did it.Let's read this question.A moving coil galvanometer has a coil with 175 turns and area 1 cm².Ok?Good.Turns were given and area was also given.It uses a torsion band of torsion constant.This is your C value.This is your C value.Which is C theta in that formula.The coil is placed in a magnetic field parallel to its plane.And this magnetic field will adjust in such a way that in every rotation it will again become parallel to the plane.It is a radial field.So don't write sin theta in that torque.It is just a product.So the coil deflects by 1° at a current of 1 milliampere.Both of these will be proportional.So the value of b is, you just have to write the same formula.So cta = μB is not μB.is μB.So NIA became *B.So everything is given in it.He has asked for B.So write B only.P = C times Tata by NI A theta is 1°, right, don't do the substitution, it should be in radians, it is π / 180, so just remember it, what will come in the substitutions, 10 power -6 π / 180, because of that the answer goes away.If you write 'One Lag' without substituting 'One Lag' in radians, it will be wrong.What is the number of turns?Is 175.What is the current brother?Is 1 ml.So write 10 power-3.Area 1 cm² 10 power -4 is a lot of 10 powers.He also needs it in powers of 10.So, separate all the numbers which are without power of 10.This 10 power-7 will go up, 10 will come, right?Ok?Right?Ok?So one is 10 because the orders are different.Consider Pi as three in your mind that if you take 3/180 then it is approximately 1/60.So you are doing this to bring the answer in order.This is top 10.10 and 1/6 is 1/6 so it will be approximately 1/175 * 6.So first do 175 * 2, how much is 350, 350 * 3, how much is that, almost 150, on that side, so it is going to be almost 1/000, so 10 power-3 should be the answer, unless I made some mistake, then in the numbers, 10 power-6 is also correct, 5/180 is also correct, 175 10 power-3 got correct on 10 power-4.Centimeter square is also correct.So 10 will go up π / 180 6 is correct.If something goes wrong, write it in the comments later.I think this is the appropriate answer.Approximately that much will come.In Moving Coil Galvanometer This is a 2005 question from JE Advanced.He did not change anything in this.Brother, if this question is written or there is a typing error, do not pause and try for 5 minutes.After trying for 5 minutes, if you have not already done this in your course then it is a very important question.Try it carefully.In this he changed the rule of the game a bit.If you have read properly.Torque is expressed as tau = ki i is the current.k is constant.The rectangular coil galvometer having uniform soft terms is placed in a magnetic field B. He called the magnetic field B but he called the radial one.
If you don't have art then you can consider it as a uniform and move ahead. Then think of this as a uniform field or he didn't tell you, is it okay?If needed, will take radial.Right now initially he is asking you to calculate at that instant, right?So what is the value of K that constant?What is tau?chet isn't it?Doing it for the first question.So tau is CTA equ i * niab na so can i write that ban and into i so ban is the k is that ban ok nbi wala done yes first one question answer came second torsional constant if i not ah produces a deflection of pi / 2 in reaching equilibrium position.Ok?For this we have given C * π/2 = BN area A, so in the same way we have said and i is not i not, write i as i not.So the value of partial constant C So C = 2 PNI not tan I not by π This is your second one.Both of these were easy.The third one was a good question.Ok?What is he saying?The third one is the maximum angle through which the coil is deflected if charge Q is passed to the coil almost instantaneously.End damping is not happening.That means this is impulsive current.So impulsive force and torque will be applied.So some angular momentum will be generated and then it will deflect.So for that the integral tau dt for the part C which is the torque being felt instantaneously.That's your delta change in angular moment.Ok?So what will be tau?If this is banned then bring it out.The integral is idt.Right?So this ban int integral idt = change in angular momentum.So this angular momentum will change instantaneously.And it was at rest, if such current suddenly passed then it would generate an omega at the same position.After that, after one pass, the torque generated by Omega when it is turning and that CTA started acting.So in this duration where TTA is zero, here in this impulsive part, CTA is not acting during the impulse.Will act later for energy conservation.Ok?Yes.Yes that was that part.This is your Q which you have passed.This Q here is this Q.PNQ = I Omega Moment of Inertia Int So he has also given the moment of inertia.What will happen now?The kinetic energy from your Omega that has gone out will turn into potential energy.So the maximum angle which will be from energy conservation now C will act.And KE will turn to PE max.So the initial KE is the maximum KE.So I will write it as 1/2 I omega² or I can write l² / 2ai, that is l² l.Let me write this directly.So l² / 2ai is this value, I will deliberately write l² / 2ai because I do not want to write Omega Min.He has already given i.Isn't it?So this l is yours.So let me write ban which was your square divided by 2 * i is 1/2 c which is the value of c, you have to write this, then which is c, again you have to get the expression which you brought in the second problem / pi * ta max², this is theta max, your sum square root function, this is the answer.Ok?Yes.Now I can erase think uniform because neither did I take uniform in the second part.I was thinking that after going even π/2, neither is the product of the magnetic field and the same μB is the product of b.So this is your radial magnetic field.So it will apply the same torque at every position.So I changed it as an afterthought.And when this rotation was going on, there was no issue because the current had already passed.So this part is impulsive.It happens soon.And this rotation is energy conservation, it takes time.Dunn.Let me move forward.There is one more question.This mixture of whatever we did till now is the functioning of galvanometer.You can define current sensitivity and voltage sensitivity.And the same concept that we used in the Current Electricity chapter for already building a voltmeter using a galvanometer is the same.So I'm doing this as a review of that topic.Ok?Then take a pause for two-three minutes and try again.Come let me study with you.A moving coil galvanometer has 150 equal divisions.Ok?Current Sensitivity Is This Thing.Current sensitivity is Tata by i, you can see the unit current on so many divisions, its units are milliamperes on the divisions, similarly you can also tell the voltage sensitivity, how much voltage is across it, its edge is number of divisions, OK, from these two we can calculate the resistance.
You can call in the order that each device reads 1 volt because you want to convert it in a voltmeter. Reads 1 volt. You obviously have a very long resistance in series or what is called not long?You have to connect the bigger resistance.What is its value?And you see in the options neither wants you to go up till this kind of thing.So don't use approximations.Ok?So first they try to find out the resistance of the galvanometer.If 10 divisions is given rise to 1 milliampere.What is the full deflection current of 150 divisions?What is the full scale deflection current?1 milliampere per 10 divisions of 150 is 15 milliamperes.Ok?That means when 15 milli ampere is going through it then it will deflect fully.How many vos will he measure in the same full deflection?Every two divisions is 1 millivolt.So it's a 75 factor right?So the edge is 75 millivolts across it is agreed at that instant in that case then the complete division when it turns then when the current across one is 15 milliamps and the voltage is then the resistance is the division of both of them.So which implies the value of resistance of the galvanometer RG would be the value of 75 ml/15 which is 5 Ohm brother.This is the way you get the resistance of a galvanometer from the sensitivity values.Now you have to convert it into 1 volt voltmeter.So this is what you will do for a 1 volt voltmeter.You will say that you have to connect a resistance across the galvanometer which is in red, so that its reading becomes 1 volt. Each division reads one volt, so what should be the full reading?Full reading of voltmeter of voltmeter I should see is coming out to be each divisions reads 1 volt 150 divisions when it is showing then 150 volts you have to read.So you want that reading across this is 150 volts when it's full scale deflecting.This is a galvanometer brother.This is possible only when its full scale deflection current which is 15 milliamperes is flowing.So from here 15 milli amps go.Question is done.So your series resistance RS will drop almost this 150, so you have to write 15 milliamper * 5 ohm plus 15 milliamper * RS should be 150.So 15 ml * RG + RS has to be 150.So this is Milli, 15 will be deducted, 10 is on that side, so it is 10 power 4, the sum of these two is rg + rs 10000, so you have to remove 5 ohms from 10000, otherwise rs will come, this one, this one drs = 10000 - 5, so 9995 has to be marked, 10 power 4 is not given anyway.Even if 10 power 4 was given then it is not to be marked because that is the answer.It's done.Correct.Ok.Let's move ahead.So when I have talked about good questions of gauge, I show a little on each side.Yes, see this, this thumbnail will be found in the playlist of Physics War Series of 12th in this Nexus channel.I also got many other questions related to galvanometer, voltmeter and ammeter done.So, don't miss this video.Ok.I put it in this slide so that when you download the PDF of the slide, you will get this pointer.Ok?We cannot give all the links below.So but the things you have to do are to download the Atlas PDF.Look at the PDF given below that session and flip through it quickly.Whatever you have read before, you can read it from me, from anywhere.Some points may have been missed.You may not have written some points.You might not have noticed, take it off.Ok?Don't waste it.That session was good.Ok?If you are watching those sessions also, please like them if you have not liked them before.The next concept will be called Garomagnetic Ratio.Ok?Yes.So in physics non-magnetic ratio is also known as magnetogeographic ratio.Ander Garrow is related to mass and inertia magnetism.So the opposite word of these two can also be used.But this is given in our syllabus in NCERT.It is a ratio of the magnetic moment of an object.There will be a charge on the object.You will rotate it.So the rotating charges are loop of currents.These loop of currents will contribute towards μ.Once we have defined μ so far, it will be defined and we can also calculate the pure angular momentum of any rotating object.When you calculate these two in some special cases,
Sho na a number comes.That number is the geomagnetic ratio.And will not depend on how first you are rotating.Because there will be omega in this calculation also.There will be omega in this also.The ratio omega will cancel.And that value comes for specific situations.I will tell you to use it directly in this question and I will also tell you in which questions it should not be used.And if you are a 2026 aspirant watching this video, he has given the questions where you should not attempt them in 2025 JE Advanced.And that question, I do not want to reveal it now because any year when you are doing your pre-examination, always leave a question of the same particular latest year paper which you have, don't do its questions only in the last, do not see the questions, you have 2 years of that particular exam, especially you do not have to see it and that 2 years is to be given to you like a mock test one or two months before in March and April, so I will not reveal anything.And I will get the question done OK right coming to this for a class classical rotating body the value of this non-gyromagnetic ratio which is μ/l this will become And valid for if the charge and mass distribution are similar charge is being distributed like mass is also distributed on the body then this will be Imagine charge is unevenly distributed.The mass is also distributed in the same uniform manner.That's why this ratio comes.See its derivation below.It is a simple situation.q/2m.So μ/l will always come out to be q/2m provided.I told you charge distribution and mass distribution should be similar.So uh angular momentum will become omega na?You must be remembering the formula of and i for many simple bodies by now.So you will not need to do the derivation of μ again.Will you trust this formula?You will multiply l directly and calculate the magnetic moment.Ok?Read the questions once and try.We have a thin circular disk of radius r is uniformly charged.You applied charge uniformly on the entire area.Ok?And the disk rotates about its axis.What you are thinking here is that the way the charge is uniformly distributed over it is also the same as the mass.So this formula becomes valid there.So the magnetic moment which is μ, in this question you will write directly which is charge by 2m multiplied by moment of inertia * omega, you will take l in that direction and you will write this mr² / 2. Remember about its axis when it rotates, moment of inertia will become mr² / 2, this is omega, this will cancel m and charge is nothing but σ * πr², so this is this.It will be σ * πr² r 4 omega / 4. If you see four, then write four, then the answer came directly without integration. Whatever integration you had to do, you have already done it in 11th and you have memorized the formula of mr² / 2. It did not turn out like that, nor did it also have an integration derivation, you are taking advantage of it, okay now one more.Let's see the question.Still, for two-three minutes you were like yes no, this one is not the one which was my mindset, the next one will come.Let's do this also.A You Can Use This Logic To Your Bourse Model.Where there is electron circulating charge, you can also consider it as current.Its area of ​​orbit can be defined by adding that area to these and its magnetic movement.This is orbital magnetic movement.The electron also spins and its magnetic moment is different.He is the one with spin.We are talking about orbital magnetic movement.Ok?This is an example question of NCERT about circular orbit.1 minute.Think which option seems right to you.Right?done?I am not watching the chat.OK Easy four options Read correctly OK We What will be the chiromagnetic ratio of an electron in a hydrogen atom according to Bohr's model?q will be / 2m and q becomes -e so it is negative.What is the negative suggesting?What it is suggesting is that your μ is -e / m times of l times.When you write in vector form, that means both of them are in opposite directions.The angular momentum that comes due to mass and the magnetic moment that comes due to charge are the opposite.So this is negative.And it will be independent of remember l at nh/2 so μ is proportional to n but the ratio
Because n will not be there then he asked about the ratio then it is wrong right d is wrong μ is proportional to n is right mvr = nh / 2 independent of orbit It is independent of orbit right.This is also correct.Does not depend on the value of n.That orange value.Yes.How will you represent this?If this object is rotating like this then your l bar coming out from the right hand sum rule will be like this.This is the l time, brother.But its magnetic movement is exactly in the reverse direction.So this is your μ.That's what the negative sign represents.Ok?Let's move ahead.Yes, this was the question I was asking so impatiently to represent you.It was.Right?Try it for two-three minutes.Then I will give the suction.Right?I won't stop now.Two-three minutes.You have to do it by pausing.Will do it.I am assuming.You tried pausing.Ok?Moving forward.An insulating thin rod of length L has a linear charge density on it.So these people did not distribute the charge uniformly.Charge described linearly.But he did not mention the distribution of mass anywhere.Right?So the distribution of charge and distribution of mass was different in this.And then you cannot write q/2m directly, whatever will be the ferromagnetic ratio.So the road is rotated about an axis passing through its originRudy is so Omega, how much has he given?n is seconds per rotation, so 2 n is seconds per radians and dip the road like this. From top view to top view, the road is rotating like this, so when it rotates, each of its dx elements will be like this, which is the dx element, it will have a circular motion like this.Ok?From the centre.This will be like a circular loop.So one d of this circular motion and all such d's you have to calculate separately and integrate to get the total magnetic magnetic moment.Ok?So this d will have an area of ​​π x² If it isLike we saw in the situation with electron, if someone asks you what is its effective average current, in one circulation you will say, what will be its charge divided by time period and charge divided by time period?2pi / omeg So you will write like this, omeg / 2pi and omeg, in our question only 2pn is given.So q omega / 2π is q * n can write omeg / 2π which in your current calculation is so this is the value of current here this is i * area required that is x² x² so what I am trying to say is this is your di current x² you had to integrate this.I am just saying here that magnetic ratio will not work.Ok, let me write it here.U cant u μ / l = q / 2m Here edge m and distribution of charge is different.m is unevenly distributed charge is not correct, this integration is of x dx, rest all will come out, this roπ / l is weighing out, your x ^ 4 / 4 is coming out, so l ^ 4 / 4, this is one l left, l / 4, you have to mark it, it is visible okay.Done let's move forward.So another q/2m situation which was paramagnetic ratio especially when you were calculating l in all the three slides was l about axis.If l were about point because there is a very important difference in the basics of rotation.Angular momentum about a point and angular momentum about an axis.Reflecting this, I had created an original question years ago.So this is his video.So in this playlist you will see that I am encouraging you from the beginning of the video that after this session you have to complete two playlists.One with magnetic force which we are almost eliminating right now.The next part of the sessions would be Magnetic Effects of Current Bioseveral Law Ampere Law Extra, that too will have a separate playlist.This one has conical pendulum motion charge
Okay, please take a look once.And you will not be able to use even two q / 2m. You can avoid integration by using a trick.Ok?So he will definitely see.Let the Biose Law begin.Let's take a little break.From here is bioassay law.Approximately we finished in 3 hours.Within 2 hours and 2 hours all this will be over.Don't worry.Ok?So the break is 5 minutes.I will just drink water and come back.And all the new people, children, have just come to watch the session.Remember, at the beginning of the session, whatever I told you about DPP and the length of the session, read it all once, do the right thing and stay till the end of the session. And if you have not liked it yet, then please like the video. Okay, let's do breathing exercises for a second and come back after walking for a while.Will be completed in almost 2 hours.We are going to do less than 2, so make sure do not pay attention to the chat, pay more attention to the screen and whatever questions are being asked to you, pause and try a little and see the question further, please ok right yes and whatever is the doubt, as I told in the beginning, after the main session, whatever main comments come after the main session, then you can ask by putting a time stamp there, later I will answer.You can also see in the previous section that all those doubts have been answered.Whatever genuine students ask will be fine.Right?So make sure that the interaction continues but at the same time your complete concentration should be on the subject.Ok?Right?And if, as I told you before the break, if you have not liked it, your study from the War series is going well, then please make sure to like it so that we can create more such content.Correct?Ok right.Well, Biosever Law is silent in both.It is called biosaver law.So Coulomb's Law explains how a charge will produce an electric field.Similarly, Biocella will tell us how a moving charge will produce a magnetic field.In the session we have seen till now, the magnetic field is already given to us and we calculated its force as an effect.Now we will think about the source of magnetic field.Which will be the end source?Either there will be moving charge or current.Current Itself Is Like a Moving Charge.And how will different current distributions produce magnetic fields?We will see that in this special session.Ok?Right?So the Biosever Law indicates that a moving electron with velocity V produces a magnetic field B. True that.So you should know that law first.Just as you wrote Coulomb's Law of 1/R², similarly Boyce's Law for a moving charge you are supposed to be able to write.So that law comes like this.The value of the magnetic field which is moving charge is moving in the pink direction.If you have to extract the magnetic field at a position point P due to that moving charge, you have to visualize it as if this moving charge is a current wire and you are holding it with your right hand.You can see that description here.Ok?So point your thumb out in the direction of the motion of charge.If it is positively charged, then if it is negatively charged like an electron in the same direction, then you will have to hold it in the opposite direction.For now I have shown +q here.Ok?So when you hold it, all four of your fingers except the thumb will curl.Right?On this side of the plane.So that curling direction would be the magnetic field.You can see that the curling of the fingers is coming out of the board if you hold it like this.So you can find magnetic fields out of the board at different positions.You can write this as cross product.Right?So that cross product will become this.The magnetic field due to any moving charge comes out to be equal to μ0 / 4π like our 1 / 4i0 is the constant here in the electric field.Multiply by obviously charge * v times crossed r times / r This is the cross product.The electric field is along R times.Here the magnetic field will be perpendicular to R times.Perpendicular to both the position vector and also the velocity vector.Seeing this, some students think that this is inverse cube law.
,See, in the question of NCERT Exemplar, that option is also given to trap you.Right?You can see that this is not an inverse cube because here you have written R times.If you convert it into unit vector.Then this will become v bar crossed r capped by r² so this is still an inverse square law only and not inverse cube which means this one is wrong Option magnetic field parallel to v bar is not perpendicular to v bar This is wrong This is right It is along the line joining the electron and point of observation along is slightly perpendicular to R bar ifIf it is along then this is the right option, then this is also wrong.You can write one more thing for future questions.You can see that if you send q inside, then this q * r cap / r² which is the form, is nothing but the electric field produced at that place.Right?If you look here, if you want to draw the electric field, because of this point charge, the electric field at this position will be like this, right?This will be your e, right?So you can actually write this B bar in terms of E bar a charge.So send this in.And in future when you read Electromagnetic Waves, you will realize that μ not and which Epson0 came in that particular chapter, both of them are related to velocity of light.Ok?And an important relation which we will derive in this series also.We did it in your classes too.So that will be this form.So this would be also writable as e bar cross e bar / c² where square = 1 / q Not this was what I'm going to point out.So you can actually associate a magnetic field of a moving charge with its electric field in this fashion.Ok?It is not needed in this question.But if there is an electric field due to a point charge there and also gives its velocity due to the point charge then you could be able to write it the magnetic field directly like this.Ok?And all of this is under the assumption.This biosaver law that you have also written, all of this is under the assumption that the velocity is very small compared to the velocity of light.The velocities we see here should be non-relativistic.Non-relativistic is a word used when velocities are pretty small.So if it turns out to be relativistic then we should study relativistic electromagnetism.Those which are not in our JE and Even Olympiad syllabus, then you will study them in future, when you take Physics as a PhD branch or Research branch, it is a very good, very interesting subject, that is right, yes, the study there will depend on how much you study this particular topic, well here is the foundation for those topics, okay so concentrate well here and if your interest is in this field.These fields will be your friends later.Ok?Let's move ahead.Now we wrote in the previous slide that what is the magnetic field due to a moving single point charge.If this collection of point charges is moving in a wire, we call it current.So how much will be the field because of them?This is the next level of biosaver law.Ok?So that is similar to our q * vs r cap which is written, then you can convert that vs r cap into current, for idl bar right then the law is similar, again cross r cap / r² is inverse square law.The only difference is here also the ideal vector is like this.Take a small part of any current carrying wire.This is the ideal vector.We took this for calculations.Now we are calculating because of this field at this place.So there is an r times vector from that particular position for this particular point.The ideal vector is one.So the cross product of the ideal vector and this r bar vector will decide the magnetic field here.So you use the right hand thumb rule.Here is the ideal vector in the diagram I drew.r is the bar vector here.This is how you will rotate.Your thumb, which is the right thumb, will point into the board.So here I am talking only about this part because of the magnetic field.If you want to calculate the rest, you have to take it out here one by one and then integrate it.We are writing here only as a small contribution.Ok?Right?And that value is coming out to be this is a vector form.and his mag
When you write the height, if the angle between the idl r bars is phi, which you can see here, if the angle between this vector and this vector is phi, then the cross product will be sin phi.So this is the magnitude form and this is the vector form.Ok?And you can see that the magnetic field will circulate around any current carrying wire.If you go into here, then on this side, at the same position, if you come to this side, here the pay will come out of the board and here it is in to the board.So it will come out and go in from here like this.So wherever there is a wire, you can hold that wire with your hand where the direction of thumb is the direction of current and which is the curl of the fingers, the curl of the right hand fingers is going inside here and out of here, that would give you the direction of magnetic field, that visualization comes.So if you look at this wire from this direction, imagine that it is an eye, then if you look towards you or from below, from here, in this view, the current is going away from you and into the board, then by doing this you can say that there are circular such fields around this current wire, I have shown the same view here, if the current carrying wire in to the board, current is directed into the page then the magnetic field will be given by this.Right Hand Thumb Rule Point the thumb in the direction of current. The curl of the fingers will be your direction of magnetic field. Okay, so this is the formula that will be used in the next stage where different current carrying wires have different current carrying distribution, we will find the magnetic field.Like it can be a straight wire, loop, circle, etc. So the first current distribution about which we will calculate the magnetic field is straight wire.Ok?Will take straight wire.For the infinite special case, make a finite wire first, just like we did in electrostatics, because of a finite wire, the field that comes in front of it, neither two components have come, here only one component will come, the obvious reason is that if this current carrying wire is carrying the current as we saw in Biosever's Law, if you imagine your right hand holding it like this, then whatever points are there in front of it, the fingers of your hand will go inside.Through this space the field will be into the board and the fingers of your hand will come out from here.Right?So the field here would be all outward.So you have to apply the formula of only one component.So the logic is very simple.Each is an ideal element, isn't it? I * DL element which is the current element vector, hence the magnetic field here will be DB.So imagine what we have shown in the board there will be DB because all the DBs are in the same direction here so you can add them like scalars.The value of the db Wood B μ0/ 4π * idl bar r bar and dl bar cross r bar The angle between these two is visible, this is the angle, isn't this pink ideal bar is above like this, r bar is like this, so this is the obtuse angle visible, this will be π - apha so sin π - apha sin apha only, right?Right?So, it comes to I * dl * sin apha / r².Now see, the logic is here dl is also variable, alpha is also variable, r is also variable.Like we did in electrostatics, we will write these three parameters in a single common variable.That angle.Ok?So the angle idea we will say is coming from the fact that this distance a is a constant for all ideal element vectors because a is a perpendicular distance so it will not change.Actual distance will change but perpendicular distance never changes.So that means we write all the things which are l or r in a.Ok?So what do you need here?If we want dl then we write R first.The value of this R in terms of A and Phi and A and Theta, if you write theta here AN theta then it is R = A sec theta I can see.Ok?You have to substitute that.And L is A tanta.But there is one thing, there is no substitution of l here.You need substitution of dl here.So differentiate it and dl will come.a is a constant.There is no change in a.So this will be a * sec² θ dta So your substitutions are obviously alpha in terms of Tata, you also need it.90 - theta
.So you can see that the substitution of alpha becomes cos theta.sin alpha becomes cos theta.Let's see what happened with the rest.When you write c² theta in place of r and also sec² theta in place of dl.Now see, in exchange of r², one of your sc² will come down and the sc² of dl above will get cancelled.So the only surviving element will be sin alpha which is sitting there itself as cos theta. So now you will do theta variation from the lower 2 to the upper 1, from the lower 2 to the upper 1 then it will become - 2 to + 1, okay?The bottom has negative angles.There is zero in the middle on perpendicular distance and +1 on the top, so when you substitute this, the answer will be inward, which here you are showing inward, right?So if there is a current at the top, then the field will be inward here and outward here and if there is a current at the bottom, then it will be reversed.This is the formula.Now we will convert this formula into special cases.Where if there was an infinite wire, what would happen if there were an infinite wire? 1 2 What would happen?We 1 and 2 individually 1 will also be π / 2.2 will also be below π/2.So for that you sinπ / 2 + sinπ / 2 then one two factor will come complete here.So μ0i/2π distance would be the value of the field due to infinite wire.Write it once.Look, the expression of infinite wire will be what I told you, 90° 90° and all this is proved.It is not that we just wrote a law like that.Law Always Comes from Experiments.The example we are taking is the direction of the right hand to the thumb, the current to the curl of the fingers, the magnetic field, all these visualizations did not come just like that because when those people did all this, they could not see the field at that time.We can't even see it.Its effect is visible.Right?So he did an experiment to bring such visualization.So this is one of a natural pictures.This is the original picture which you will find in good books like Resnikent Halliday University Physics.So where you can see there is a current carrying wire from under a table and they threw iron filings almost on top of the table which is smooth.So when there is no current, the firing filings, which are small iron pieces which are affected by the magnetic field, will initially stop in the direction in which you threw them.When that current passes, they align themselves in the direction of the magnetic field lines.You can see that what we are talking about is the curling of fingers, the concentric circles that are visible here and there were revealed in that picture.So this is how the main motivation comes from where you write the law, cross product, right hand curl, right hand thumb rule, it comes from there.So this is the original picture.Laws are made through observation.Ok?We brought this by substituting 90 and 90 for Infinite Wire.We can also solve problems for semi-infinite or finite wires.Take a look at Semi Infinite Wire.Semi infinite wire is such that one end goes to infinity.The other end will have a defined angle.Imagine, the upper angle is 90° and the defined angle at the bottom is theta.So one sin 90 will come.One sin theta will be left.And if you want exactly the end of semi-infinite wire, then you can make theta also zero.So it all depends on what the value of the theta is.So this is also easy.All these are special cases.Magnetic fuse to special semi infinite wire at exactly that point.As I told you, if theta was exactly zero then exactly half the field would be.So this is half of Infinite Wire.Ok?Ok.You will find many such problems which have been asked in previous years' Mains and Advanced. Such questions have been asked in this environment and in the DPP that I am giving you, you will also get many such questions for practice.We will do some practice here also, now let's finish this first.What are we doing now?We know the field of a wire.Already, at the beginning of the session, we applied ampere force on a wire.Right?Calculation means a wire.If someone applies a magnetic field on top of it, then a force equal to 1 ampere is applied.So we will calculate the source and effect together here.That means the field on one wire exerts a force on the other wire.
Can, right?So we will calculate it.By calculating the force between two parallel currents.Later we will also call these parallel currents as like currents.So these are also called as like currents.Just like our charges are like charges, unlike charges, attract, triple, extra extra, similarly here we will make a statement.And it also has a physical significance, historical significance too, which we will calculate the force between these particular parallel currents, the significance of which I will tell in the next slide.Ok?An important fundamental dimension, fundamental quantity among units, is defined through this experiment.So we took two parallel currents, one IA and one IB are long.So because of this, hold the field above it like this, try to hold it like this with your right hand.So the thumb is pointing in the II direction.So curling off fingers would go in to the board.Now don't apply Ampere's law on this.Which is Ampere Force Law, not Ampere Law, not Ampere Force.So B bar is like this into the board.Its own current is like this.Again right hand thumb rule ideal bar cross B bar force attractive is coming right.You applied cross product twice.One source for one effect.So you will calculate the value of FBA which is force on B with respect to A and due to A on a part of length L.So the value of that would be this is your ampere force, right?This is the condition of your amplifier.Ok?And this b of A that you substitute is μ0i / 2D.So this cross product here is a product because the angle between the two is 90°.So here it comes.So you can see the force per unit length which is fba divided by the unit length comes out to be μ0 * The product of currents divided by 2π distance and if currents are in the same direction they are attractive and currents are in opposite directions it will be repulsive so what do like currents do is they attract like charges repel but like currents attractAre.And with this magnitude we do not define a fundamental unit like ampere.We defined Tesla by q*vs b.Let's define ampere from here.Ampere is a fundamental unit right?Not Coolum.Charge is not a fundamental unit.Current is comes from this expression.Ok?Right?So parallel currents attract each other and anti-parallel currents repel each other and because of the force of those currents you will define ampere.If you are taking two parallel currents I1 and I2, if by chance both have equal current say 1 ampere.You define units in such a way that you make everyone one.So if you are running 1 ampere 1 ampere in the same direction in both of them then the value of force per unit length between them if the distance B is 1 meter.Imagine this distance B, you take 1 meter, it will be given.I think go on that formula.It comes to μ0 / 2π.Keep everything one.Its length is also 1 meter.These are all forests.Then what is the value of unit length wood B μ0 / 2π and μ0 / 2π on the force?The value of μ0 / 2π is 2 * 10 power -7. This means the value of μ0 / 4π which we will need in later calculations.So by this actually you define the empire understanding.Ok?So this is used formally to define the unit ampere of electric current.If two parallel long wires held at 1 meter apart in vacuum carry equal currents in the same direction and there is a force of attraction of 2 * 10 power -7 Newton per meter then the current in each wire is set to be 1 ampere.We turned it upside down.If you get this much force then current is defined as 1 ampere.Ok?Ok.Let's move ahead.We have done Finite Wire.Extrapolated it to infinite wire.Now let's do it for the circular arch.Ok?So, if any circular arc is carrying current then how much field is there at its center of curvature, that is our interest now.Ok?So this circular arch will also have many ideal elements.There will be small IDLE elements.So here you see the DL vector of that one ideal element.And then you will put it r times like this.Then you will impose biosaver law.What is covered under Biosaver Law?idl bar cross r bar because in straight wire the angle was changing between them but in circular arc whenever
If you go with p dl, the r bar will not be perpendicular, then this integration is even easier.Right?So when you write this DB here, the end direction is also very easy.Look at each part, take your right hand and hold it in the direction of the current.Your fingers are coming out.So the field here is out of the board, right?The field is out of the board.Correct?Here also out of the board and the value of that each db is going to be given by μ0 / 4π idl * sin this time 90° no alpha wafa sin 90 here it is.When you integrate this, you have to cover the entire angle from 0 to then this letter comes.So if it was a complete circular arc then you would keep 2π so in the special case the full loop value of = 2π The value of B at the center is B μ0i / 2r OK?If there are n turns then you will write 2π n then you will get b at the center = μ0 ni n times its answer or you can also remember it like this, you write like this This is nothing but due to any arc is equal to deliberately / keep 2π aside and then you remember μ0i / 2r.μ0i/2r would be the field due to a full loop.Ok?Right.Dunn.Shall we move on?There is a comprehension based question based on this arc.2009 Mains or A Triple of that time came in it.So the first part is here, the second question is here, let's tackle this first.Pause the question because this is a two question part.You can work on it for four to five minutes and then see the solution.Ok?Ok?Come on, I am studying with you.The current loop ABCD is held fixed on the plane of a paper as shown in the figure.This ABCD is a loop that has both radial parts and circular arcs.The common center of curvature of both circular arcs is the same.So these are concentric arcs.Actually these same centers are called concentric.So the radius of the arc BC is larger.B and the radius of the arc DA is smaller.Is A.Correct?The segments with ends AB and CD are radial.If you extend them then we will meet at the centre.Study Current Flowing in the Loop The angle made by AB and CD at the origin is 30° which we calculated in the previous slide, it is 30° in this.That is π/6.Another straight thin wire with i1 current is flowing out of the plane of the paper held at the origin.The origin of this is not visible here but he is saying that he has introduced another such outward current here.So obviously due to the field of one, there will be a force on the other and perhaps there may be torques also.So in this case the two current loops are one is one current loop.There is a straight wire out of the board.Ask questions between these.The magnitude of magnetic field B due to loop ABCD at origin.The first question is clear.Even before the wires are placed, a magnetic field will be there.How much is that?Now look there are four parts.AB and CD which are straight wires will have to be calculated.How much is it?We can tell.I think if you are doing any chat right now then you will immediately tell that AB will be zero there.Why?If you look carefully at any wire bioseverla, you will understand.If you want to apply a field on the extension of any straight wire, you want to calculate it.If point P is like this, if its current is like this, then you can see that ideal bar and R bar are parallel, right brother.Now see, this will be their first time like this.Right?Of every single point.So this is R bar and this is ideal bar.So when ideal bar is parallel to R bar their cross product will be zero.Is parallel to R bar here.Ok?So this will not produce any field at this particular place.Any radial wire at any point on its extension will not be able to produce any field.Ok?So you just have to calculate AD and BC and you see D to A. When you hold the wire with your right hand with your fingers coming out from O, then D to A will produce an outward field.When you want to hold the end BC, you put your thumb in the direction of the current, then the fingers will go inside in this direction.So both these fields will be placed in the opposite direction at center O.Which means your answer has to be subtraction of the fields.Done.The same calculation will happen.Which angle is common.I will use this expression.The ratio of both is 5π/6.So this part will be 1/12.μ0i/2
Is also the same.Just R is different.One has A, one has B.You will have to subtract that because the fields are moving in the opposite direction.So from can i this would be π / 6 of angle / 2π μ0i / 2 times difference of r.r is 1 / a - 1 This is the answer you have to find.And the one who is at less distance will dominate.This out-of-the-board field will appear.Is this ok?For 1/12 it will matter two and 1/2 will be visible.So this answer is coming brother.Correct?Or now let's move on to the second part.This field that you have just come outward from, right?Due to the presence of current I1 at the origin, the forces on AD and BC are only because of this, you have to calculate the force. For the second option, in this option, how much is its field here. You see this wire on CD, what will be its field? If you hold it like this, thumb thumb, if it is like this, then your circular fields will come like this, then the fields that will come will be circular fields.Will be.If they go along AD, then when the field is also in the direction of the current, then the forces on both of them will be zero.Right?Wear edge and above this also the force of BC is zero.I think option A is directly correct man.On AD and BC you will say that if their current and its field are parallel then the force that will come is zero.Ideal Bar Cross B Bar.Check the remaining options also once.Force zero will not come on it.You see there is option four.Forces on AB and DC are zero.This is wrong because if I tell you that this is the field here at this point, I think such a field will come and as you go away, the field will reduce.This is not a uniform field.But there is the field.So in the case of this CD, the ideal vector is like this, B bar is like this, so their cross product will be neither on the CD nor on the force in the board here.Similarly, you will see that the ideal in BA is like this.B bar is like this.Ideal Bar Cross B Bar Outward forces will come here.So this option is wrong.The forces on AB and CD will come out to be zero.Actually, because of all these forces that will come inward and outward, a couple will come.You can see that it will rotate.Ok?So the magnitude of net force on the loop is given by, you will have to check this because it is a Mains question.Only one answer can be correct.So option A is correct.When you try to solve it, you will have to integrate these forces.This field will have to be written at any distance x μ0i / 2π x and the force will have to be integrated on this line.And that one will come like this.And this one's sorry force will come like this and this one's force will come in to the board and both these forces will be neither equal nor opposite.So the magnitude of net force on the loop is given by this will be a zero.Ok?Because it is zero.This is wrong.There will be torque.There will be no force.If this is also zero then this is also wrong.Dunn.It would have been a very good question if Torque had asked.You can say this for future papers.There is one more important thing here.If torque asked then don't use μ crossb is not applicable.Why?Can you tell?You remember, right?μx b Torque calculation if there is a magnetic field in a current carrying loop.But there was B uniform.Yes, here on B, this small wire is not small, which is outward wire, because of it, the field is not uniform under its influence, so you cannot apply it directly. Even after writing B, which B will you write, will you write it on the distance A or on B? It is visible, no, not applicable. Yes, you will have to integrate by taking each small loop, its torque is non-uniform, so it is okay.Let's move ahead.So this is a similar arc based question.He has given three different questions.This smaller arch has the same size among the three.The larger arc also has the same radius of curvature.All three points have been given at the same level so that you can compare.This is drawn to scale, brother.All three are at the same level.Look okay?And this smaller arch is also at the same level.Look, you will have to think like this.And these upper levels are also the same.Let us read the question.Try 2 minutes and rank the circuits according to the magnitude of the net magnetic field at the center.You have to write the greatest first.A is more, B is more, C is more.You have to write that.It will be the same as we did in the previous A triple equation.It will be similar that if the current going in one goes anticlockwise then in this
Here also it will go anti-clockwise.Correct?So this arch and this big one are getting the arch and field added here.Here the wear edge goes clockwise on one side and anti-clockwise on the other.Both of them are getting the field subtracted here.This is actually the same as this picture that we used here.Minus came.Remember?Ok?Right?The third one.I think this and these N fields will be added and B which is the second picture will be subtracted.So let's write quickly.And those will have the influence of lesser radius and greater angle. I think here the greater angle is contributed at smaller distance.I am saying the right thing.Now think about the smaller radius, imagine its radius is A.Its radius is B.Here the mega angle is called major arc in mathematics.This mega and major arc are of smaller radius.So its 1 and a and its 2 and b.Both are being added but 1 is larger than a because in your formula you can see / r is the same part.So if a is large and r is small then its contribution will be more.So according to me, when you see and try to test, this one will be the best.So C will have the highest magnitude.Next will come A because athlete ads are being done here.These are being subtracted.So C will be greater than the magnitude of A and at least would be the figure B. Right?Because the answer of C will be proportional to 1 / A + 2 / B and this will be 2 / A + 1 / Atleast plus is coming.Ok?Right?But the Na of B which is of the second one is 2 /a - 1 / so this is the smallest, this is proportionality.Rest all terms are same.μ not i / 2 they will all be the same.It's done.Greater angle is contributing not contributing but smaller radius is contributing should be written.Look at one mains question.The same wire is being bent into circle and square and the magnetic field is being compared.Again just pause for 2 minutes, attempt the question and then see the solution.Ok?Yes.Two identical wires A and B of same length L carry the same current I both are wires.Their perimeter lengths are the same.Wire A is bent into a circle.Wire B has been shown to have the same perimeter as both of them in the square.So the radius will be included in the formula of both the circles.Whatever the formula of the square, you will need more perpendicular distance on the center of the field or you will need more on the side of the square.So we will write that individually in both.So I will put the square here.Ok?This is the Square and the Circle from here.The perimeter of both is same l so here if you write l = 2r then r is important for you and here if you write l = 4a then at this place b μ0i / 2r at the place of the center of the circle and I think the field that will come at the center will come because of these angles, remember these two are the angles of the finite wire.That individual is 45° etch.Is it visible?This one is also 45° and the other one is also 45°.Because of end symmetry, you can say that the field here due to one wire will be the same for all four.And which means you can calculate one field due to wire and then take four times.So in their language, the magnetic field due to the second wire will be first 4 times μ0i / remember 4π distance, that is the formula, what is the distance? This orange one is the length of half of the side, so it is a / 2.Then you have to write sinθ1 + sinθ2.That will be sin 45° + sin 45 so I write 2sin 45 at one place.Correct?Done.He was asking for the ratio of these two.So the required ratio pa / bb, first settle this four and four cancel two will go up 4sin 45 i.e. 2 2 something like this is coming right, so the second one pa 2 2 /a ok rest of the current cancel all that and here 1/2 their ratio is required so one a / r 1 / 4 2 a up r down now look at the place of r l / 2π you substituteYou will do this and replace a with l / 4 so one more step 1/4 2 into l will cancel out.So this should become 1/2πr instead of 4 and r, right?I missed a pie, man.Written 2r here.There is an extra pie here, otherwise this pie will also come.Pie will come here also.So a pie is waiting for you.1 /π will come in vb not in db.So it will be found above.Write 1 /π here.So in this the pie is weighing on top.Correct?Now it is correct.So this is π² down by 16
.8 2 It's coming.Check the answer once.Correct?So, some calculation types were given in Mains in 2016 and 10 years ago.Nowadays it is coming direct formula based.Such questions are coming less.Like I said, I expect the athlete to improve this time and maintain some competitiveness.Not very long.Just testing whether you know the magnetic field of circle and finite segment or not.Simple C.And patience is checking your calculations.Correct?Instead of just direct formula.Look at this combination again of straight wires and circular arcs.Let's do the left side one first.So this is in three dimensions.So this segment is a semi-infinite wire.This is a semi circle.And this another semi infinite.You have to bring magnetic field at O.Correct?Imagine holding it with your hand.The thumb is going like this.So your fingers will point at this point in the negative Y direction.So if this is a forest.This is a forest.Its B1 will be like this.This will be B1.Ok?Now you will try to catch it.If your curling of fingers is like this, then the magnetic field is due to it, if it is to color it in a different color.So d2 will go into the board.I am saying right.Similarly, if it is three, it is also a semi infinite wire.And this will be called right hand thumb rule i.e. I will come this way.You will hold this thumb in the direction of current like this.Going into the board here.Three is also into the board.So one negative y and two negatives coming in the x direction.Write the formula individually and add it vectorially.I write b1 one by one.I will give you this homework.So let me write out the value of b1 magnitude wise - by saying j cap.Yes.So μ0i / 4π distance * sin of semi infinite wire will come to zero.A 90 will come.So I told you that half comes from infinite wire.And what is that distance?That is r itself. The distance of this semi-infinite wire from this point is the perpendicular distance r itself.So this μ0i / 4πr will come with a negative j cap.Did you say it right?Then calculate B2.Write it out.Obviously this is in to the board so -i is cap and is semi circle so half of full circle so μ0i / 4r done and the blue one is B3 it will be same as B1 magnitude wise these B1 and B3 will be same magnitude wise.Direction wise is not the same.So copy this but copy its vector.So at μ0i / 4πr - i cap just the required answer is just add these two.Then write i cap and then write j cap.So this is this, you can do homework.Right?This is 3.228 of Erode.So do your homework and check the answers.The match will happen, friend.It's such a nice three dimensional picture.Look, both of them will give the field in the same direction this time.Will not give in the same direction.The current is in the same direction.R is times different.Please check.Ok?Both of them had the same R times.Actually I made a mistake here also.Now look, the tent is like this.Someone wrote in the right chat, yes, I will check it once again.After going there, I started having doubts about paying here.So if it is like this, then the field is because of this one, if I hold the right hand properly, it will not go back like this, it will come down first, then it will curl, this yellow one, the direction has been written wrong, again it comes down, it will come down like this, if we check once again, then it will be -j cap, not -k cap. You guys were right.B2 is definitely correct.I was doing right.B2 This red one is correct.Again I have doubts on this also.Caught like this and it is in the board.Yes this is correct.Yes.You can say that this is an extension of two and three and is not in the same plane.When it is in the same plane, the magnetic field will be perpendicular to that plane.So that's why both of them are parallel.perfect.You can also remember that the second and third segments belong to the same plane.So, both of them will create magnetic fields in the same direction.So, I corrected.Look, this will be K cap and not i cap.You can say one more thing that this is a wire of r times so idl bar cross r bar idl bar cross r bar downwards is correct, minus k is correct, now the same logic is applied here and divided into three segments, this was one, it completes 270° like this and then going back to infinity, its time is done, write the time stamp of this video.I think 3 hours something you can write such time stamp
Te ho.Then write the answer in the main comments, not just now, not in the chat.I will correct.Even if there is any doubt, I will answer.The next one is another long wire question.This is a very good question.Generally children ignore this.Called example is HC Verma's very nice equation.One important thing is that there is a methodology by which you integrate.I had explained the same methodology in a charge moving in electromagnetic field, which I had already shown in a video of multiple methods on YouTube, you will have to show some smartness here using the Rolling Disc Analogy with the same logic, not in the same logic, in a similar way, so my opinion is that if you are doing this for the first time, pause the video here, this time, give it 8 to 10 minutes.If this question appears in the JE Advanced exam then the JE Advanced person will also give you it as a part of a matrix of matching and comprehension with two questions.At least six marks should be there in this question and it will be a very correct question in the current JE Advanced model.You can also do some variations of this.But the main crux which is the main soul of the question is this.Correct?Let's go, I think you paused and followed my instructions.Now let's do it together.A long straight wire carries a current I. A particle having a positive charge Q and mass M held at a distanceSo the treasury they are showing is a projection of a particle.Actually did the project like this.If this wire was not there then it would have gone straight till O.But when the velocity is like this and hold this wire and see the magnetic field in the board.We saw the Biosaver Law.Right?So if V is like this, velocity is like this, VB will be downwards, then if someone applies such a force on an object going like this, then it will take a turn like this.So that curve is happening.So at one place in this curving path the velocity of this particular particle will be parallel to the wire.Then it will be at minimum distance.He is asking for minimum separation.So in such question you just have to write the equation that x component of force and y component of force and you have to solve it accordingly.So take any arbitrary position like this.This is x y and your velocity vector tangent at that instant will also have two components.Think of vx and vy like this, vx and vy will be your force.The value of force vector v is ma bar is given by q * b cross b Right now velocity vector is this blue one which will have two components vxi cap + vyj cap is in the xy plane na velocity is like this i cap j cap cross b Its will be na here at any place I think into the board Now here it will be into the board also so into the board in this entire plane is negative Z axisNa ifYou see, you need this distance in the formula from any infinite wire. You have that distance d. For this point x, that distance for y point is x coordinate, so you will write interestingly here the cross product μ0i / 2πx 2i depends on x but the direction is negative.Is.So you can write this acceleration here as m here by m and here pe by m and this acceleration you can write as axi cap + ayj cap.That is, you want to equate a vector with this cross product of acceleration vector.And the obvious thing will be that after this cross product, an i cap component and a j cap component will emerge.So individually you can write equations of x and y.So this implies two things: ax kitna aayega and ay kitna aayega?Let's write it separately and split it.Now for x component you have to cross j.j cross k gives u i right.So the x component is given by this j crossed with a - k so which is a negative value and everything else is na q / m vy μ0i / 2iSo ax will actually depend on vy is interesting.Ok?Right?So you would write ax is dependent on vy with the rest of the numbers.I write down all those numbers on the side.that constant
Is.So q μ0 i is also common.This number divided by 2m is repeating in both the factors.This is q/m.This μ0/2π and an i I will call this entire system a lambda.Even lambda so other than that your vy will be saved.Right?Ok?Is good.I take alpha.Correct?So Am I Getting - Alpha by x okay?And similarly how much will ay cost?I think ay which is j cap i cross - k positive j is coming na i cross - k will remain the same alpha will be ex divided by x.Now look, now think, if you want to integrate this, what is your mindset?This should be your mindset.You are going to a point where velocity becomes parallel to the wire and parallel to the wire I think x component of velocity is zero brother.So you have to impose a condition of vx = 0 and if you want to get vx then you will write ax as vx dvx / dx and r. The problem is this, all that is fine but here there is vy, you have to eliminate vy because everything is necessary to be inA vx which can cancel this and everything will be in x coordinate I can easily do the integration.It is not yet integral.So there's one important thing that electric fields can't do.Will show by doing magnetic field.No matter how many dirty curves this bending is doing, the magnetic field never works.What does it mean?We do not know anything about this motion and that curve.But one thing is that the complete speed will be constant.Why?Because the power of this q * vs b force is zero.So speed is constant.That's Where We Get Saved.This is difficult but we use v is constant.Speed ​​is constant brother.That means vx² + vy² is constant.So vxdvx + dydvy = 0, from here you will substitute vy. If you have to eliminate vy, then what will you substitute for vy?py = - px dvx divided by dvy Ok.Ok, you can do that here also.One second here, here, here, the substitution is easy.Let's see there once a/dy = alpha dx/x ok?It is in x direction.It is in y direction.This is the y direction and this is the x direction.Where to substitute it in these two?We will have to think about this.The one who gives good relations.Right?So go here and go here and substitute here also.Think about it.Here alphax / x is ready vy dvy if I replace vx in dvx here dx dvx will come.You have to write dy 0 vx0, you only need the relation of dvOk?Now see, if a vx is canceled then from there you are getting the dy/x relation.If you substitute px dvx here, your x component of velocity should be zero.So you need dvx coming right here.Ok yes hey man, it is direct here, I was thinking why did I go in this direction, I don't know what is the limit of I was not thinking that but if speed is constant and v if dx is zero then vy v will be the same here, speed will be the same, so I should have taken that curve here, there was no need for me to go in this direction.Look at this, remove this.Ok?So let's substitute this one.We were going right.I was a little confused.Yes.It happens.Because I forgot this.I should have written it here.If I have a speed constant and here there is zero speed, zero component of x, then the entire y component will take its speed.So what is there to fear from dvy?So when you substitute vy with dx dvx, all that gets canceled and one dv / is left.Alpha is waiting for you there.Alphax/x will come.This is a very correct equation.So when you integrate this, you want initial x not there is no vy velocity.Look the initial velocity is all beautiful right vy velocity is zero.And when you are going at x minimum then the total vy velocity is v.Question is done.Will come in some exponential type.So the x which is minimum will come like this x not * e power - p / alpha then reverse it and substitute 1 / alpha.This will be your answer - q i bye actually do you have to do reverse na 2mv bye it comes this is yours
Minimum distance.Very good question.Even when we got stuck, we solved it by taking the help of the diagram.Ok?In this type of situation, whenever curves with magnetic field are given, always do not forget that work done by magnetic field is zero.Work done by magnetic field is always zero.This means speed is constant.Same thing, we used that pink section here.Ok?Let's move ahead.Such very good questions which I am telling you, you were a little stuck right now.Such stuck type questions which are multiple methods.I did these in session.You can think that this was for last year children.This does not happen.In whatever sessions I do, I usually do not repeat the problems again and again.And I think that even if it is a playlist on Physics Surgery channel or a selection of good content on Nexus, there is no point in repeating the questions because my children listen to what I say, so when I tell them to watch it, they will see it later, then my time is actually saved so that I can get some new questions asked for you instead of repeating the same again in the classes.Repeated it from Physics and Surgery courses.I don't do this.Ok?Until then it is repeatable and very important.I will do it wherever you want.10-15% will be like this.So the remaining more than 75% would be non repeated.This is an 8 hour session.Don't look now.Let me tell you one thing.The next session will be of EMI and AC in our war series.After that you can finish speaking about electricity and magnetism.Then go and download the PDF of its 100 plus illustrations.Check the PDF first.It was live on May 13th, 2025. You will get the level up series of Physics by speaking, you will scroll on Nexus channel.Ok?Download and keep.And watch this after our war series of AMI&AC is done.And if you find any PDF part difficult, go and see that part once in the session.Ok?If you like it, please like it.It was a great 8 hour session.We had taken the exam just before.I didn't think after this meth, the exam was in 10-12 days at that time.The next one is the magnetic field on the axis of a current carrying loop.Let's investigate it.See.We did the electric field on the axis of a ring.Found out a very nice function.Similarly, here also for each ideal vector and r times r times such slant heights will be formed.So when you put ideal bars across r bars, b bars will also form a cone of vectors like this.In which the perpendicular to axis components of the magnetic field will get cancelled.Only parallel to axis components will be added.So you will have to add these dbx ones.Have to take only integration of all this dbx only this will survive.And you will integrate everything by writing everything in cos theta dl.This function will come.Its proof is similar to the one in electric fields.There is a slight difference in butt function.The function there was a function as far as I remember.There was also an x ​​at the top because the electric field was zero at the center and also zero at infinity.So in the middle I think there was a maxima at r/2.But here the magnetic field is highest at the center and zero at infinity.This is a monotonic function.End Monotoism You can see that there is no x above.The complete constant is above.So this is a pure x² + a² power 3/2 function without n x on top.So if you graph it, it will be highest at the center and monotonically decreasing function till infinity.So let's look at the differences in this.And this is μ0ia a², you have already associated a ring with a magnetic dipole moment.Remember?Its μ is the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment. You had already written i * πa², so you can do one thing, you can introduce a pi here and here in the numerator and the i * πr² term, you can call it μ, then it will be easy for people to remember μ * μ0 / 2π. When you write μ, 2π will be above and below.So it is showing how much field there will be on its equatorial line due to a dipole movement.If there are n loops then you will multiply by n.If there are n loops of the same wire then you will multiply by n.and jay
From I told maximum will increase at x = 0 right?There will be maximum at the center only.And the answer of that circle will come at the center.Dunn.And the direction of the axis of the magnetic field can be found out again by applying the right hand thumb rule.The same thing has been given in a slide so that you can get it in the notes.So whatever you are thinking of magnetic dipole moment, you can think of it like a magnet, you can think of it as a magnet, you can take the north pole as the south pole, then the current carrying wire, with the right hand thumb rule, you can take the dipole moment in this direction, then the field lines of the magnet that you see in the books, that would be similar to the field lines given by this loop, that is why this formula is very important.It becomes μ0 μ times / 2pi * So when you do this over a large distance, I have taken it in the z direction. In this diagram, there wasIn this regard, see a question from NCERT Exemplar.Try pausing for a minute.Then see my solution.A current carrying circular loop of radius R is placed in the XY plane with center at the origin.Half of the loop with x > 0 is now bent so that it now lies in the yz plane.So what did they do?Half of a nice circular loop bent perpendicularly like a chair.Look, earlier the whole was in xy plane.Now this is the half part which I show in red red.If you bend it like a chair, it will become like this.That symmetry is there in the graveyards, where a tombstone has been erected.So this is that common white line.So what are they asking?It was now this xy plane in the yz plane.Magnitude of the Magnetic Movement Now Diminishes.So the magnetic moment of both the parts was in the same direction last time.These two will be added like this from Lets, right?So when you do it like this, it will remain like this.Its turn will be 90°.So it's like adding two 90° vectors instead of two parallel vectors.This is less.The value of this μ1 will be greater than μ2 will decrease.So this is correct.Magnetic moment does not change is obviously wrong because it is a vector.You can see the vector edition.Magnitude of magnetic field at 0 was its axis.This was XY plane.Its long and wide axis was the point of the z axis, so both of them together were creating a field at this point.When it turns like this, its strength will remain the same there.Its strength will reduce.So this magnetic field that will come every second time, this one B, when you do this here, B prime, it will decrease.So he said increases this is wrong.Remains unchanged is also wrong.The decree will actually happen.This will actually decrease because this point of this dipole moment will be the equatorial point.The field is halved at the equatorial point and also reverses.Correct?So only A is the correct answer.Next is our last section and that is Ampere's Law.This is similar to our Gauss Law which helps us in finding the magnetic field in a system of symmetric situations.So there in Gauss law you used to take a Gaussian surface and the charges inside the Gaussian surface decide how much electric flux is going to this surface.The integral was e times dotda.This time there is no flux loss because the magnetic field lines form closed loops.If you take flux from any Gaussian surface, it will become zero.So that becomes a trivial equation.The magnetic flux from any Gaussian surface will be zero.So we have no interest in it for now.So we want this time to take the circulation integral e bardl, the integral e bardl in the electric field was zero on the closed loop because it is conservative.The magnetic field is non-conservative.So here because the field itself forms such loops, right?So we think that when you travel along it and do the integral b bardl, there is no rule of always coming to zero.So we are interested in that part.Correct?So for that you will define an empyrean loop around current carrying structures and an empyrean surface which forms a surface of the loop.Right?This way.So this part will be called as error
This surface.Write properly.Ok?This is the Arrian surface.So the empyrean loop is surrounding an empyrean surface.Empyrean surface is different from Gaussian surface.Gaussian Surfaces Are Closed.Empyrean surfaces can be flat, curved, open, etcetera.Ok?So, the currents are being cut through that empyrean surface.So how many cut currents are there that would be deciding the integral b bardl of a closed loop and that comes as in Gauss law that q q is enclosed by epsilon not here pe μ will come in the numerator multiplied by the sum of all the algebraic currents i.e. the currents have a direction.If there is a sign of charge then there is a direction of current.You will apply positive and negative currents according to the direction.Again, no matter how bored he is, there is no problem for him.If your right hand is safe then the right hand rule will apply everywhere because the entire topic rests on the cross product.So whatever path you are taking, you will curl your fingers along that path, which is the direction of the thumb, take whatever currents are in that direction as positive and whatever currents are in the opposite direction, take them as negative.So there you can see that the thumb is pointing up.So I1 and I3 are positive current.I2 is negative.Look, the person watching I Unclosed from above will see it like this.So I1 and I3 are positive and I2 is negative, you will write it on the right hand side.That would be the value of circulation and that's what Ampere's Law is about.You should have one more doubt which is not given in the first page in text books.If there is a fourth current here, imagine a fourth current like this, at exactly such an angle and going from below, make it a tick so that that current looks like this, a fourth current is cutting, it should also come from below, like they were doing, let's make it thick as well.If the fourth current was cutting and I4, if we connected I4 like this, this is I4.So the angle won't matter.How to write as long as current enclosed?Angle doesn't matter.That outer surface which has orange color shading, when I cut it, the angle at which it is cut does not matter.So this just has to be cut.So angle doesn't matter angle of cut doesn't matter.Just have to cross the ampere ampere surface.The angle of going through does not matter.So if we include that i4 also then it will come here - i4.are you watching?Ok?So in this anyway you will show him in the board only.By the way, it is cutting perpendicularly, it is going like this.Doesn't matter.So this is your Ampere's law in which the inside part is a scalar product and this surrounding part is a closed loop.And remember this is also due to all the wires outside.If there are any wires outside, you will also get a magnetic field because of them.But only enclosed currents will come on the right hand side.We also saw this in Gauss' law which is integral e bard e is due to everyone but on the right hand side what is enclosed in your q are the inside charges.Ok?So two important observations which I have already told.Right?One is this part which I said is in the same slide.You can pause and read it comfortably later.So just because circulation of any part of any closed loop is zero.Doesn't mean the magnetic field everywhere is zero.You may have a current going in, a current going out and there is actually a magnetic field at each point.Is not zero.But when you get circulation, neither will these two B dot DDL nor acute dot products come at some places.At some places this whole thing is showing cancellation of positive and negative terms.It is not telling that B is zero.This is an important point.The second point is that what we saw in your electrostatics is that E around a closed path is always zero.There was no circulation there because it is conservative.Now because the magnetic field is not conservative.The integral b bardl is not always zero.And it is not related to work done by magnetic force.Brother, don't think that Sir integral is B.DL.Now non zero is coming in the path so it is working.No work of magnetic force is not along B Q * VB. You had to write it, right?Then we take the dot product and it comes to zero.Work is zero but circulation is not zero.This is a very important aspect.Magnetic Field Actually a Non-Converter
Vative quantity.The magnetic force on a charged particle is non-conservative.Where the Electrostatic Force is Conservative.It doesn't work but it's not conservative.He works.He works.Does not work in closed loop.He is talking about electric field.Ok?This is a variant slide.Later, read it completely once comfortably.Whatever I talked about is in English here.See how you can understand the cut currents of the empyrean surface?That is the test in this question.Let's do it quickly.You can take these loops separately to the side.This loop is showing a clockwise path, isn't it?So if you move your fingers in a clockwise path, then whatever inward currents there will be positive.So this plus will come.And this minus.Correct?And the loop you have in this is anticlockwise.When you apply the right hand thumb rule like this, what is coming outward will become negative.So you have the sign.This i1 will not contribute at all.So the integral b times dot d alpha this close loop there for will come out to be μ0 times of i4 itself is positive.All other negative ends i I1 will not even contribute.This is the answer.You substitute.How much is 4?Is 8.8 - 4 a 4 - 6 -2 coming man.The answer is -2 μ0.And what is this Weber? We will read about it in the EMI chapter.Weber which is WB.This is the unit of magnetic flux.There will be a lot of discussion of magnetic flux later in the EMI chapter.So if this is Weber then B bardl is the meter on Weber, right?He wrote it here deliberately.So later you will understand.For now, you can also call this a Tesla meter.V*L Is Tesla Meter.The meter on Tesla meter and Weber is the same.Let's move ahead.In the end I will also give you some homework problems.What did you do in Applications of Gauss's Law?You extract the electric field from symmetric situations of some standard charge distributions.Similarly, you might have calculated some standard current distributions using the Biosaver Law.But again you can do that by getting the magnetic field checked.Ok?One second, when you calculate the long straight wire, if it is the same current then it will enclose and b * dl which is given at every place dot product in the same direction, then the integral will be bdl b * 2πr.So you will get here the same calculations that we did with Biocella.We will also solve some new things like solenoids, but first we gained confidence by applying Ampere's Law to a well-known thing.Ok?So you can see what I have written here.The problem solving strategy will be directly related to Gauss Law.So, in the session we conducted on Electrostatics, I had given a lot of examples of Gauss's Law there.So review it once.How will you calculate the field of a long cylindrical conductor?You have to do both the outside and inside points.So the J of a current carrying conductor will be i / πr².This is a vector.So it will help us in writing vector equations.So for the inner points, when you write p * 2πr, it will only enclose that much part of the current.Full current will not come for the inner points.So for the inside points where r < r, b * 2r will be μ0j times of πr², the more r you multiply by j, you will get this, so you can also write this as μ0 j * r / 2 and vectorially you can also write this j times r times, that is why I wrote J.Ok?So B bar inside is something like this part.is a linear function.So for the outside one, please see this outside path.In that, R is greater than R and the entire current gets enclosed.So the manipulation you did last time is not necessary.μ will not become i.So this will be similar to having this entire cylinder crush to a single line out 1/r will fall out.When you measure the distance of its field, the inside one will give a linear function and the outside one will fall by 1/r.So the paths we have taken, this one on the inside and this one on the outside, are the surface points.There will be maximum field at that surface point.Look, this is a two-sided path surface.So Max will hit the surface.Ok?You can do this for holoconductors too.It's easy, friend.No current only outs in hollow conductor
The iron will flow on the sheet surface like this.Right?So when you try to put a field inside it, no current will be enclosed.That's why in a hollow cylindrical pipe where the current is flowing in the direction of such axis then the field inside will be zero.This is what will come outside.Ok?There are many mains and advanced previous years questions based on that graph.Keep coming.This graph is a very favorite graph for the examiners.So there is a question on that, let's see.Pause and read it once.Similarly, we had asked arch questions there and we will do the ranking similarly.Which is the strong field?Who has bigger radius, extra extra.Ok?So the figure gives as a function of radial distance magnitude of field inside and outside four wires.Cylindrical Wires.These linear parts will be inside.So the curved parts will be outside.We know already overlapping portions of the plots are indicated by double levels.That means this part is the same for both the wires.Because even here there is a surface of B which is inside the same surface.The radius of A is obviously larger so it is higher.So you can read it like this.So Rank the Red Wires According to the Radius.I think all these radius will be king points and not points, you can call them king points.Right?All these I think this is the radius of B.This blue line is of D, isn't it?This is the radius of D.This is the radius of A.And this of C.So I see C has the highest brother.Let me write here this RB this RD this RA this RC We want them to rank so in the first question you could say RB is less than RD is < RA < RC is okay?Now look, look at the second one.Magnitude of a field on the surface.As soon as you look at it from this height, it appears that A is the highest point on the surface.Now D seems to be the smallest.So the answer to the second question will be B is the smallest on the surface and D is the least.The height seems to be the lowest.Coming next is B.Next, what I am seeing looks like C.And the magnetic field A is felt above the front and strongest surface.So P has the maximum.See.So this is how we read that graph.Look at the third question.Value of current in which one is the greatest?So, you can do this by calculating the currents at these common points or you can do this by taking the maximum outside when the currents are going to infinity.Take any outside point like this.This is outside of all wires.Outside of all wires.Outside of all wires All these wires behave as if they are string straight current.Now look, we did the same thing here.Outside of all wires will be μ0i/2pi.So at a common distance the one whose field is greater has greater current.Right?So at this common distance, A and C have more fields, so the current in them is more and that of B and D is less.So you can tell like this.Yes.Both are getting equal amount.So current in B and D are same.IB = ID which is less than A and C.It's okay.In this way, the following question can become a good match for you for JE Advanced.The last one is the magnitude of current density in wire A is greater than laser and then C. So these currents are the same in both, the current density is still under discussion.J is being talked about.Obviously this is the radius of both.So you will club these two, you will club these two relations and write the option D, then if the currents are the same, the wire which has less radius will have more J.So J at A > J concentration is more per unit area of ​​current.This is another question.Read the question carefully.The graph looks similar but your eyes should go to the y axis of the graph.Pause.Try for 1 minute.Then you answer.I am assuming.You tried.Tricky question isn't it?This time they have not put b on the y axis.The entire question is given on cylindrical wire only.But if you mark this one without reading then it is wrong.It looks like this is the previous question.But here there was b.Now what is this time?Is P.DL.Ampere is talking about circulation.So when you do circulation, I think for the inside wire, it is talking about the right hand side.Is Talking About This Number Right.This one is proportional to the inside part.
r² is not proportional to r b is proportional to r but that will be proportional to r² i.e. you will get a parabola and after going out there will be a constant Right so if you are careful you will not lose marks in that interesting question then you will need a parabola and a constant so be careful this is not b this is not don't mark.Ok?Whenever I give these questions in the exam, more than half of the good children get attracted to its beauty and make a mistake.Because he asked a lot of such questions.So the answer is sitting here without reading the question.Correct.Let's move ahead quickly.Yes, this is your homework question.Why am I telling you homework?This is a very standard question.We also created a function of the magnetoelectric field in electrostatics by putting a cavity inside a sphere.Here also you have to use the same superposition principle.Please read all four options carefully.And if the following statements are made then more than one may be correct.I will wait for your comment with time stamp.Ok?The logic is similar.You just have to use one thing.Superposition means fill this whole J and fill this whole minus J.And take some points here and superpose.It is a very easy question.This has come up many times in exams.Across Chapters Gravitation, Electrostatics and Now Magnetism Magnetism.So you have to take this help.I also gave a hint.Correct?Ok?Be sure to comment below.Time stamp please.It's a very long video, isn't it?You comment without a time stamp.It becomes a problem for me.Comment after the session is over.Correct?When you solve, solve it for 5-6 minutes and come up with the correct option.This is a proper JE Advanced question.Take correct directions also.Read that whole word.If he changes X to Y then the answer will not match.So you will need patience.I have made a slide of this hollow cylinder.I told you already when we were doing solid.Only zero will come inside.Outside it will remain like wire.So this is also just for your notes.When you download the slides, proper notes will be created for you.Ok?Especially if you are not studying from me either in Physics Surgery or Nexus or in practice then this will be useful for you.The next two things are the Before We and Our Session.We will solve the problem of magnetic field of a solenoid and magnetic field of toroid and a sheet of current.Ok?Right?So the solenoid is nothing but a helical current carrying wire.I have put all the pictures you need for visualization in a single slide.So solenoid is like a helical wire.The current is going inside from here.By doing such and such turns, the current will come out from here.So the stretched version of the same is this portion of the stretched out solenoid.Someone stretched it like a spring so that we could see magnetic fields.So your magnetic fields in the inside part will be almost uniform.Yes, they will be curves when they come out.But the inner part will have almost uniform field and the outside will also have leaking fields like this.Look here it is leaking. Go back to the field because such circles will appear on these parts.So this is a very good visualization.On this field map also, questions have been asked by giving diagrams of options.Questions can also be asked in JEE Advanced in Olympiads.Can be asked once in Mains also.So don't ignore it.He can copy such situations from anywhere.Ok?So what should we do?Will take an ideal son line.Which is infinitely long.That means its length is so much.These field lines want to bend, but they are not getting ends to bend.So you think like this, of that infinite part which is the middle section, only this part has been zoomed and we have put it here.So that became the uniform field.Here we will insert the empyrean loop like this.Why am I taking the Empyrean Loop like this?Because I already know that the magnetic field is in this direction.So outside the field is zero.Why is the field outside zero?Because you did not bend and let him go out.So there is no field there.So for this blue color empyrean loop here B * becomes H.
Sing.There will be no circulation dot product of the magnetic field on these three sides.So whatever B*H was your μ not* current should be enclosed.An important property is the number of turns per unit length of the magnetic Ah solenoid.Which is n is the number of turns per unit length.Closely packed, right?So this small n which is the unit length per number of turns.So tell me one thing if I write.If it's h distance, it's the unit length number of turns.What will be the total turns?n*h.If the number of turns is n*h.How many currents do you see?If each is i, then the total number of currents cutting through that experienced surface will be n * h * i.So h will be cut from both sides and b will come to μ0 ni.We have crossed out h.So this becomes an important formula.You have to remember the magnetic field is due to an infinitely long solenoid inside.If this solenoid were finite this would not be correct.For finite you will have to use biosaver law.I will give its formula also in the heading.So you can derive.So, where does it apply?Application of Ampere's Law in a section of a long ideal solenoid and ampere loop is the blue color A B C D A. Okay, this is your finite solenoid. This cannot be solved using Ampere's Law. You have to use Biosever's Law or you can derive it. I will tell you how this finite n1 and n2 are defined. You have a dx width in it, you have a current carrying in it.You can take it like a ring and that point of the ring is an axis point.There is a formula for the axis point, you can integrate it by writing it in the name of the db.Then this form appears.Always remember that it is Ta1 and Ta2 that you have to major in the same direction.From Let's n1 is on this side so if θ1 is taken clockwise then θ2 also has to be taken clockwise.If you write n1 on this side and n2 on this side, then take it anti-clockwise.It all depends on In the same sense, you have to find θ1 θ2.So you can also check the infinite solenoid with this.So when the solenoid is infinite, both these angles will become neither zero nor 180.So what will be cos 0 - cos 180?Two will come.So your formula comes back to the infinite solenoid which we created from Ampere's law.So this whole slide is this is like a cross verification of that ampere law.Ok?Let's move ahead.Toroid: Whatever solenoid you saw in the previous slide was straight, bend it and make it itself like a tyre, which are not tires on our vehicles, they are torus.So if you tie a wire on that torus, it becomes a toroid.So this structure has two paths inside it.You can speak three paths.One is the completely internal path.The second path is inside this cross section.We get the idea that if the magnetic field is inside the solenoid and not outside, then when you bend it like this, those magnetic field lines will also bend themselves and will remain in the same space which is the inner space which will be formed like a doughnut. The donut has the inner space where there is no wire and the outer space where there is no wire, it seems that the magnetic field is zero. We have to prove that.So three paths have to be taken: the inner donut path and the path inside the cross section where we expect the field to be and the third path completely outside.I think your total current enclosed in path one and path three will be zero.Why would it happen?No current is visible inside on path one.In path three, the currents in the board and out of the board will be canceled and will come to zero.So B outside will come out to be zero.That is, the field inside and outside the hole of this cross section is zero.Ok?But the path to where actually the material points inside the field will be there.So for there i will be enclosed.n*i is the total number of turns n.When n is infinite then you use it.Unit length per number of turns.When finite, count the number of turns.So this time it is in the form of capital n.So p * 2πr is n * i then this form will come for toroid.This is inside the toroid.So the magnetic field is confined almost entirely to the space enclosed by the windings.If I give you the example of the tires of our vehicles again, the inner part of the windings
,Wherever there is air inside, there will be a field.This part.Ok?Right.Let's apply it on another part.We're Very Close to the End of the Session.This is a very important application of Ampere's Law.In our YouTube list also there are questions on the method I am going to do in electrostatics and also on magnetism.Remember, the magnetic field around a long straight wire is like this?If this is a long straight wire then the field lines will be like this, not like circles.So these field lines will cut, so they have given a path, you have to make circulation on that path.Let's assume one thing you will do is draw a dotted line from here and apply the magnetic field here.You will integrate, this is a method of integral b bardl.But there is another simple method that I want to do.If you want to try again, it's a long session, you have reached here, you should bat yourself on the back, not many people will be there, I don't know, but the selections are not right for everyone, so I am proud of you, if you have reached here, whether it is live now, what you are seeing or later when anyone is watching this recording, then just make sure that whatever you haveDone during the session specifically, which was given in the instructions, not wait for 2 minutes, wait for 3 minutes. If you follow that, the session is probably going to be around 5 hours, maybe you will be doing it intermittently, then it will be six to seven hours in the recording. When you are watching, you will do it in two parts. Okay, so make sure whatever you have learned through this you try to apply.This to your actual preparation also okay right, what we will do in this is we will think of this particular wire as a small radius.We will think like a cylinder and by thinking like a cylinder, these radial lines will enclose it.Do you understand like this?And whatever he asked, I will take a closed loop only on this path.So in this closed loop, the magnetic field will not come perpendicular to it, otherwise the circulation will be zero. Here, whatever is your quantity of circulation, it will come above it and that should be related to the current enclosed and if this is a cylinder, these two radial lines are going like this, if you have calculated then the current enclosed will be θ / 2π * i isThat right?If the entire theta were 360, it would cover the entire cylinder.Right now it is the only part.So this is the trick.Here the magnetic fields are zero on these radial lines.Why did I do such a dirty thing?Once I show the magnetic field properly.Mags will be like this here.So because of these perpendicular B bars, there will be zero circulation above these lines.This is your value.You just have to find out theta.How much is coming theta?I think he has given a lot of good triangles.This 1/3 of this is forest.So it's 30° brother.And this whole triangle look is 45 degree right isosceles.So the pink theta that is visible is 15°.So this ratio 15 / 360 * is the answer right?So 1/2 is brother.μ Note i / 20 so if it is to be 24 it will be four.Value of alpha equals.Ok?Almost the last question.There is a homework.We're done.So you can also take a sheet of current.Where you can define K.Like we defined J.When the current is cutting an area.Similarly, if the current is going after cutting a length.That means there is one sheet.This is how the current is going on the sheet.So if you look from that side, it is cutting a line, isn't it?So we will call it unit length on current.So the unit length from nonwords on the current is a k vector.This is called current per unit length.In these terms of this current unit length your job is to get if it is sheet.The current is coming out from the sheet like this.There is a point p at distance x from it.You have to extract the magnetic field at that point.This is an infinite sheet.So, because of symmetry, you will say that when you try to hold the sheet like this, currents are coming out, then keep your thumb like this, then your hand will go up like this and go down like this.So the 2D version of this will be like this.That point P is above it, right?One of its conjugate points will be here.Where the fields will not be exactly reversed.So B at distanceWill be in exit direction.So if you do one Emperian loop, it will become BL.This also BL
Will be done.Ok?So the value of 2BL will not be a field here.You can see why the field should be like this.Because of this, the field will be like this. Because of this, the field will be like this. The result of these two will be like this.So you can check it using BioSeveral before confirming that its resulting field will be like this.So that's what I took here.Ok?That is your B net taking using by Sebar.So the value of that B net is this B and how much current is being enclosed unit length on current is K so if length on current is K amount of current is K * L then it will be μ0 into current which is K * L then L will cancel.The value of B at a distance is independent of the distance.Just as there is an electric field in front of our infinite sheet of charge, the answer is coming in the same way.And actually two is also being reflected.Look, if you write this is analogous to this then it will be easy to remember.Remember?Sheet of sigma is distance independent.Two are the same.See K has taken place of sigma and μ0 in this chapter Na is always on top.Where σ0 remains below.Look, if there are two sheets, one above the other, then like capacitors, opposite charges, like charges, same logic, that is your homework question.Look at this one, if both are in the same direction then you will catch this one too, you will catch this one too.I think the field inside will be zero.There will be an outside and outside field.This is my advice.Do your homework and put a time stamp.I will tell you the answer.Ok?It is a simple question.It's done.Ok.So if you have reached till here then make sure if you have missed in the beginning, please tell me what I told Physics Sir Ji which is a collaborative channel of Unacademy, the two playlists you have to complete are your magnetic forces, these are Biosaver Law and Ampere Law's 9 + 8. 17 Videos Before we start EMI, EMI will start in 10 days, EMI and AC, these are the two parts of EMI and this is the part of AC.Maintain the sequence, I also checked the DP and showed it.I will still show it.So make sure go to this home page.Scroll down.Electromagnetism Challenges: You will see this playlist on the home page.Due to this, put the time stamp below the same video.Doubts of this video: Whatever Google Form of 2027 is mentioned below this video and in the description, please forward it to your friends.And I already told you that if you want to renew Plus, use this code, 60% is not known today or by when, I think they would have written it somewhere, find it out, if time is less, then you have decided that if you want to study from us, then take it quickly and the rest is due to the shortage of time in the session, I did not get one part done and I am expecting, and it is an easy part.Not that at all.I got it done in electrostatics.On the same logic, I am highlighting the videos of magnetostatic pressure in the playlist that I have already shown, so that you can see that there are many good videos on magnetostatic pressure in it.It has multiple concepts in one.So do this.I could have told you to take a look.I would like to show these thumbnails again so that if you are short of time, you can choose which videos to watch and when.This is your DPP.Mains has 32 questions.I have prepared 41 very good advanced questions and placed them here.Had compiled it.These are different from your Nexus course and Physics surge course.So, for those Nexus students who are studying with me, consider this as a topup of their DPSS.So those of you who have studied with me also have these advantages for them.There are advantages for those who are joining me for the first time.There are no repetitions.EndDPP file and solution description can be found below.Join Telegram group.I have put all the links in the first page of that DPP.Which Telegram group to go to, where is the playlist, everything.So take the PDF and follow it.That's it.Right?Thanks for staying this long.Yes, as usual I can't see the chat.When I teach seriously, no, I expect students also to have some responsibility so that they remain engaged on the screen and not on chat.We will chat later.After the session is over.That's how my style is.Right?Easy typing of time stamps anytime.Even after 2 months you
