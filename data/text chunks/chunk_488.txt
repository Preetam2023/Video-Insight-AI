ill remain constant, when we pass zero to n and if n is passed one then we will have one everywhere. I hope this part is clear with us that our n is constant and the value of m will be from zero to 10.The number that will go up to is also a constant. The number has told us whether we want to print a table of two or three. So now we can actually write our tables inside the main function. We copy the same loop once. Here we will write zero print a percentage d b tables of 0 to a. So this one will print a table of two and this loop will print a table of three. Here in place of m we will replaceThis is done with 10 and let s save it and then run it. Here, instead of m, it is going to come every time because m is not our constant, it will keep on changing, the value will come from zero to 10, so it will come here every time. Now here whenever we are looking at this code, we are constantly seeing a red line at the bottom of the array.
