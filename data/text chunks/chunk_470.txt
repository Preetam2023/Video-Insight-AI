ant question. There are many ways to do this question and we will discuss one of them classical way. The classical way is to exchange the first and the last, then exchange the first, then the second and the second last. If there is something in between then exchange the third and the third last. If we keep exchanging then our array will be.It will be completely reversed. How does one come in place of four? If one comes in place of four, one comes in place of four. One comes in place of two. Three comes in place of three. If two comes in place of two, three comes in place of three. If two comes in place of three, then our array is reversed. Now this same is the strategy. Now we are only talking about the strategy, not talking about the code. Now we will discuss the code in which way it will be written if we have an odd sized array.The pass array would have been like 1 2 3 4 and five. In this too, the same strategy would have been used.
