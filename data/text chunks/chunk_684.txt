t I had stored in my memory. They have returned to me and if any operation has to be done with them.If you want to make changes, you can do so according to the memory that is allocated at our run time, not allocated at compile time, so in this way we have allocated the memory. Now let s talk about the next question of our practice question. Our question says write prog gram, I have written the WAP short form for this, to allocate memory to store five prices. Now the prices are generally the ones which are of our float type, so there are five floats.We have to store the prices of type in our memory, so how will we do it, the way to make it dynamic is that we will create a pointer which will be pointing to the memory allocated from mallac, five prices i.e. size of float and will type cast it to float pointer. Now we can store our prices inside the PTR. Whatever it is, all the things will be converted to our floating values. Let s save this also and run it once. This will be floating.
