he data is read in a structure and it is necessary to create that structure whenever we are opening any file.There is a file pointer which points to the structure, so the file pointer that points to the structure and is used to access the file is called the file pointer. File pointer is a special type of pointer whose type is our file because we have created the structure of the file. So with the help of that file pointer, we can open a file, close it, write things in it, read things from it and in factYou can also create files. Now the syntax to write it is something like this, first of all we write type, here our file is typed because file is a structure, after that we wrote ast risk i.e. star, after that we can write any variable here because it is a pointer to a file, so we have written F PTR. If you write PTR or fp4 is a kana name for us, we will use F PTR so that there is some distinction that it is normal.
