dation in the loop, like here we can write i i 1. Every time we will increase the value of i by one. If we increase the value of i by one, then how will this loop be controlled? First of all, i will start with one, then the condition of that one will be seen whether i 5, yes, then it will go inside the loop.If there is any work, it will do it, after that it will come here to update. Now the value of i has become two, the value of i has become two, the condition will be checked again. The condition is that i 5. Is it yes because the value of two is less than five? Now it will never go to this initial iteration again, so after this condition is checked, it will work again, then it will be updated again. Two to three, after that it will check the condition again, then it will work again, then again again.It will be updated three to four times and then the condition will be checked again. So in this way our for loop keeps running in this circle.
