her, one below the other, our code will be absolutely correct. Let s move towards the next question. Write a program homework to print the sum of the given.Number and its reverse, think for yourself, I am not going to give you any hint in this, what I have to do is just assume my number is n 1 2 3 4 and the code to get my reverse number, we have seen it, copy paste the same code, first of all, 4321, then I have to print the sum of these two i.e. 3 4 p 4321, basically what I have to do is 5 5 55, which is its sum or whatever, I have to print the sum and show it now.Think about it yourself, I am not going to give any hint here, I have to add one little thing, just move ahead to the next question print the sum of this series 1 2 p 3 4 p 5 6 up to n, we are going to solve this in two ways, first of all, my method one and method one, what can I give you just a little hint, friend, this is a very simple question, is it a very simple question?You just have to use loop and if else, you are fin
