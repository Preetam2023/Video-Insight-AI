cter will be returned to us but we will have to get it printed as well. Along with that, we print F. Percentage C This E F PTR. Now we copy this code five times.Let s get it done, whatever is inside the test, reinstall the L which is there, now save our code and run it once. Output, we will analyze whether the same will come and the output will come i.e. our character by character which is read from the file has been printed for us on our screen using F Get C. Similarly, if we open our file in write mode and this time we want to write, we comment out this also, simply we have to write f.Put C inside it, first of all we will write our character and the pointer of our file. We will try to do the same thing. L is stored inside our test file. We want to replace it with Mango. So, we are going to open this file in write mode and write Mango. With the help of Put C, save it and run it. So now look at the test file, Mango has come for us instead of L.
