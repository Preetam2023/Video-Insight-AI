ar n star n and here also we will write star n so this is a square function which takes the pointer.This means that it will take the pointer of a number, it will take its address, now all the things will happen directly with that address and here what we will do inside the function is that first of all we will call the underscore square and inside this underscore square we will pass the address of our number, after that let s print our number again and see what value will be printed of our number. Now let s run this code once and then we will analyze that code, so first of all here.So 164 was printed because we had called the first square but called the second square so the first square was printed as 16. When we came back our number had become four but this time we called the square as 16, so what it did was that it changed our number also i.e. it was four, it was made 16, so our points do something like this when we pass them inside the function.
