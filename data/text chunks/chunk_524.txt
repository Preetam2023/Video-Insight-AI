which character is equal to h and then add that count, then in this way a lot of cases can be made. A lot of questions can be made which your interviewer can give you in a different way or the college students can give you in a different way but what is the method? Go character by character. What condition has to be put at the end of the loop until it is equal to the null character. Almost all the 80 questions are solved in the string in the same way in which we have toSome particular thing has to be checked. Next let s talk about standard library functions. Now already we had read about a class named Method A in which we had read a function named pow, which used to do power, it used to return m to the power of n, so in that, this methodIf you want to use a function then it has to be included above. The first function which we will talk about is String Length. Now we have written a big function in which we went to the boxes one by one and calculated the length.
