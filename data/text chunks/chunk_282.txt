s are using it. If we talk about library functions, then already we are using the library functions. If we print F, then this print F is a library function. How is print F being called? First its name is being written, after that the parentheses are being put. Now some parameters are passed inside it. Now we will talk about what are the parameters.This print F is also a function, this scan F is also a function, so print F and scanf are inside our library or inbuilt functions and C and what is their library. We have put our preprocessor directive std ad a above, that is why we are able to use them. If we remove them, then errors will start coming inside the code, that is why it is necessary to write the statement and our functions print f and scanf are ours.Library functions are user defined functions. We have already seen this which we have created. This is what we have created. Earlier we had written print hello or print goodbye. These are all our user defined functions.
