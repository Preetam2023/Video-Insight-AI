led in the mind properly, here we will write name name percentage S and here we will write our CGPA. So now we have roll number, name is also here, our CGP is also here, so whenever you are using points, the suggestion for you is that for the sake of simplicity, in the code, it should be easy for the reader, it should be easy for you too, so next time you are reading, use the arrow operator, otherwise you can use the normal agar structure.If you are creating a variable, then dot operator is also fine. It gives preference to different things, that is, it gives choice to the programmer that you can write your code in the format as per your wish, then what happens when you have the choice, then two three formats are visible. Neither does a programmer think that the dot one is looking simple to me or I am finding the best risk one of the pointer good orI like the Arrow one the best. If I want to use it, then a feeling of personalization starts coming in my code.
