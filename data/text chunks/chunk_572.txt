he CGPA percentage of our student as f s1 sj p and at the end of all we will put back sl n. Do this.Let s save it and run it, first of all we have the name of the student, after that we have the roll number and after that we have the CGPA of the student, so in this way we declare our structure, first of all we create a variable for it, then assign value to the parameters in the variable, then we can use that value anywhere, that is, we can print that value.You can also change that value and assign it to any other value. The next thing we will read inside this is that when we declare the structure, what actually happens inside the memory. We had read that when we declare an integer array, then three continuous locations are stored inside the memory, like if we created an array of integer type, then 1 2 3, these three are our memory.Key locations are saved.
