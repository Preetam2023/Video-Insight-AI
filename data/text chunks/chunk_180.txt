ide the loop, so how to do it, so let s do it in a slightly different way, okay we can do one thing.Look very carefully, what am I going to do, I write here n, how much we have right now, 1 2 3 4 5, let s make n a little smaller, 1 2 3 4, and again it will be the other way around, 4321, okay, I am doing this, it will be a little less, but the point is the same and what is my reverse number, right now I don t know, okay for once, I will initialize the reverse number with zeros, okay, I am making a code.I am creating a number int r 0 and for now my n is 1 2 3 4 Now see what I will do one by one first of all I can do one thing is that in r I can add four okay of course I mean from the last digit so in r I added four okay so r becomes one so my here on four four second thing as I added in four so now my because n is second lastIf you need a digit, okay, then I will divide it by 10, so it becomes 123.
