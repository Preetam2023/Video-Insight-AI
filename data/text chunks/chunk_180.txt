l, we create a program in which character C is to be entered by the user. Enter the character in it. We will scan F, percentage C and C. Now we will check whether our character is C and C.It is greater than equal to a. We might not have seen this thing because we always compare with integers, we do it with floats, for the first time we are comparing the value of character with character with relational operator, so this is also possible because internally how C works, every character has an Esc value, so the Esc value of a is probably 97 and in this way, many of our characters till z.There are different values, so if we want to check the lower case, then we will check it with a. Here this is our single value also getting printed. 97 For us, if we do b here, then what will be its S value. 98 In the same way, if we do c, then it will be 99. So there are S many values. A value is basically that every character has its own integer which is associated with it and is known to the compiler.
