e have put 105 because we are the devil children of the class and even after putting 105, we passed.It was printed while we had to enter it till 100, so we can put our condition in it that if the marks which are greater than ours are 30 then the marks are equal to 100 then in that case then print the pass otherwise there is another else in which we are going to print the color marks. In this also we can put the condition that the marks which are there should be greater than equal to 0 and end marks.Less than equal to 30, so in this way, when we write statements covering all the cases, our code remains safe. Now we will compile this also and this time, if we thought that we will enter 105, then this time it will be printed for us. Wrong marks, so in this way, we have to enter the safe cases. Now, we could have done the same thing with the help of ternary statement also, i.e.If we comment it out, to comment all these lines together, we have to press command and slash.
