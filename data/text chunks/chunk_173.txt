n modelo 10, okay.So for now ours is 1 2 3 4. n is modified by 10 so the last digit becomes my four. Now ok then sum is equal to sum plus the last digit sum. What is our 5 so 5 4 now my sum becomes 9 and n n 10 again this becomes my 1 2 3 I hope you are able to understand all the things what am I saying we will go back to last.On digit then n mudl 10 then 123 mud 10 how much is 3 then value of last digit now becomes three this time sum is equal to sum plus last digit sum our 9 is 9 3 becomes 12 and n is n 10 again we divide n by 10 and so on all these things will continue one more time let me show last digit isEqual to n mod 10 then 12 mod 10 divide 12 by 10 a reminder will come two sum is equal to two sum plus last digit then 12 2 14 Okay so here the sum also becomes mine 14 n n 10 n becomes 1 Now let s come back to the last digit equal to 1 mod 10 1 mudd would be 10If my one is one then the value of the last digit becomes mine one then back to sum is equal to current sum i.e.
