is way, many people keep storing a lot of their data for years. Now here s the thing about our work.This will happen that the data keeps getting transferred between the volatile memory of the computer and the non volatile memory, just like your computer program is stored in our memory, the program becomes a part of the volatile memory and it is possible that there are many such files lying in your computer system, they would be lying on our hard disk. The computer program inside can write those files and can also read them, then any part inside the computer program i.e. RAM wants to access the files which are stored in the non volatile memory i.e. in our hard disk, so this process is done with the help of C. Different different programming languages have different ways to access the files and in this chapter, we are going to understand the input output in the file i.e. come file.How is it performed inside the computer? So first of all let s talk about what a file is.
