h which we are going to start is the definition of variable. If we talk about it, it is the name of.A memory location which stores some data. Now the name of the variable is memory location. Whenever we have to store something, we first need a place for it, like suppose we have to keep some shoes, then there are boxes for shoes, in any shop there are many shoes inside each box. Heels must be kept inside one box, slippers must be kept inside another box, so those slippers are heels, those are shoes, they are sports shoes, all that is our data.And we can call that box a container inside which our data is kept and if we give any name to the same container, then that name will be our variable.
