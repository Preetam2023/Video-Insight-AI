e call this inish jshan spelling, maybe right or wrong, whatever is written, it is called condition. This means that the value of i is one but it should be five or less, only then whatever is equal inside our loop will run, like whatever we write inside the if statement, it runs when the condition is true, then again this is the condition of the loop, as soon as this condition becomes false or ends.So our loop also ends. Now see how the loop continues. This is our increment condition, meaning what is happening after each round of the loop. Now let me explain to you what is a loop, what is the round of a loop. We come here, first of all we went here, what happens in coding, we go line by line, so we went here, we saw 4 ev, all this is done, then we went here, it is written here, print F, so we went to the output, okay, let s make a screen of the output.
