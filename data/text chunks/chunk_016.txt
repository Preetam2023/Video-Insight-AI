e it from the car class and how will we take it when we or methods methods also, we see inheritance. Once inside the code, for example, we created DocumentsFragment, we have, if we want, we can also keep these methods static, rest inside them, the S true car object is not being used, that is why I made these methods static, we can call it stop, what will the stop method do, it will stop the car, car car.Stopped, let s fix it, so this is our Car class inside which we have two simple methods. Now we are going to create another class which we will call Yota Car Yota Car and to show inheritance, we are going to put Panis here and inside it we will write the name of our class whose properties and methods we want to erase and then we can define Toyota Car. Let s assume this car.
