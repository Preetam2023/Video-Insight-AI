will input this character set and keep adding it inside the string one by one, then a loop will run.What happens whenever we input any string from our console window, we enter a character, enter a third character, enter a fourth, enter a fifth, finally hit enter, we have to keep inputting the characters in our loop inside our code until we enter the character of the next line, that is why we make the same condition until our character isNot equal to bad That is, next line, until we press enter, what will we do? We will scan F, we will do percentage C, our C, let s take another variable i which will track our index, so we will initialize i with row. Here we will take characters one by one and store them inside our string one by one, then AT of i S, then we will do i Now let us understand this loop a little more deeply. First of all, we created a string, after that we created characters.
