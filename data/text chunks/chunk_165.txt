un back enter number 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, so this is an eight digit number, so our code is working well.Now once we bring this code here, friend, and of course, dry run, we will do it, right, friend, without dry run, the work is not done, okay, or let s do one work, let s copy this slide, okay, so let us dry run this question. Look, this is a very small code. Okay, there is nothing special in it. No, you will see that it is a code of two to four lines, but all our work is being done in this entire code. Let s see how the work is being done here. Let s assume that we have enteredTake n and let s say the value of my n is 1 2 3 4 so it is a four digit number and first of all I have created an int count here named is equal to 0 and let s write a little here and there and inside this we have put the value of zero.
