f count, similarly here we have decreased the value of n by first five, then four, then three again.Two then one will take us to one, there is no other value after one because there are more natural numbers otherwise this will be our last value here, our calculation will end here and we call this condition as base case. Now we write this entire code once and see it and understand all the things. First of all, what will we do, we will declare our function above. The name of the function is even. Inside this we will pass our n, so the value of our n can be anything. First of all, ourNow let s write the recursion function. This function is not of void type. It will return an integer value and what integer value will this integer value be? Our sum is int sum int. We have to find the sum from a through a to a. So what was the sum function saying? If we have to find the sum from n to n, then first find the sum from n to n minus and add A to it.
