n. Let s not do it. The practice question says, write a program to store the data of three students. We have to write a program and we have to store the data of three students in it. So for that, we have already created a structure, that is, we have created our student structure. We have also created the information of one student. Now what will we do? If we create another student, we will copy all the information to create it.You can do this First of all, we will write s2 here, now we will write the roll number of s2 as 1660 88.7 Here we change the name and make it everywhere s2, now by copying it similarly, we will create another student, we will name it s3, inside s3 also we will be changing the values, above, let us change s2 here also, s2 or here, our s3 and s3 are done, so the initial ones.There are questions in it, I want that instead of copying, if you are writing this syntax yourself for the first time, then you have to write it by typing, not copying.
