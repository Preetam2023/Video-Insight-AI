you need 14 bytes of memory or 30 bytes of memory, then Malak will lock and give that memory to you. In the middle of the code, it takes the number of bytes to be allocated. The terms in which it measures the memory are the terms in bytes, that is, you have to tell it in bytes, I need so many bytes of memory and it will return a pointer of type void. What will it do to us?Within the total memory, assume those particular bytes will be x bytes, it will take a chunk sent by you and will assign a pointer to it, PTR, whose type will be void and through this pointer, now you will be able to access this memory, then it will take x number of bytes, accordingly it will make space inside the memory ofWhat is the syntax to write this? First of all we write malac, our number of bytes will go inside malac. Now here number of bytes, we have given some interesting thing. First we have written five and then we have multiplied it with size of int.
