ill break when our condition comes i.e. as soon as the user has entered an n which is an odd number. How to check the odd number n Percentage module 2 0 will come here not equal to 0. In that case we will break a little. Let us understand this. We have defined a variable end inside which we are going to take input of our number and then made a do y loop. First of all we are scanning our number. Above this we write another print statement. By entering the number, we have taken the number from the user, after that we have got that number printed back to see what the user had printed. After that we are checking.In this condition, we are checking whether that number is odd or even. That is, if n modulo two is not equal to zero, then that number is an odd number. As soon as an odd number comes, we will break it. That is, we have come out of the loop and after coming out at the end, we can get anything printed. Suppose we get it printed at the end.
