t will also be the correct answer, three, fourth term is my three, fifth term is five, rest all are. That s right, but if I put only number one or two, then what will happen, won t there be a problem, let s see, I enter number two, then how much should be my second term, look here, second term should be my three, now here, sorry, my second term should be one, so let s look here, press enter, zero has come, the answer is zero, the answer has come, what should we do to solve it, I run back, first term is coming, okay, this is happening because IThe sum was initialized to zero and if I put n as 2 then 2 might be 0 aa ev aa le e 0 this loop will never run if I put a as w or anything out of two and if I put n with n then the loop will run then when this loop does not run then the value of sum is printed as it is, ok there is just a work around for this. Is it simple? Instead of sum you just put one in place of sum then see the answer again.
