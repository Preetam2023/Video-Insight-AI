after that we used to put the address of the character in which we have to read and store the data. Now we have done this step here andIf this step is removed then things will become easier. Here we simply have to pass a file pointer and what this file pointer will do is simply go inside our function and this function will return to us and give us the character which it has read from inside our file, similar thing will do our put s, what put s will do, first it will take the character which has to be written inside the file, then it will take the pointer of the file in which it has to be written and simply read that file.Going inside, it will write that character, that is, we read our data from these two as well F Put C and F Get C. What we did earlier was print F. This time, first of all, we will open our file in read mode and will write here F Get C PTR. Now from here the character will be returned to us but we will have to get it printed as well. Along with that, we print F.
