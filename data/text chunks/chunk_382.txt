t of all we created a variable A inside which is stored 22, the address of this variable is 210 now.We created a new pointer PTR inside it, what we thought was that let s point it towards the edge, the address of the edge is 20110, it will come here, now this pointer will also have some address, 20113, like we had seen after printing it, there was some value, now we want to store the address of this pointer in a new variable, how will we store it, we will create a new variable.Pointer to Pointer P PTR Inside this, we will store the address of PTR, so it will be stored here by coming to 20113 and it will also have its own address. Now this chain can continue, maybe we create a new pointer to pointer which will store its address, then create a new one which will store its address, then this chain will continue. Now we have come to the last level of the chain i.e. pointer.
