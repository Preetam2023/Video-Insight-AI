e and its address is always fixed. When our mother comes to the computer, it is already fixed on it.Now the address is going to be, it is not necessary that it be 20110 or 2000, it can be anything, it is possible that addresses are written in a different way in your machine and addresses are written in a different way in my machine. It completely depends on which machine you are using, whether it is 32 bit or 64 bit, what kind of system is yours or what kind of system is mine, so don t worry about the address.Anything can happen, so it is not a fixed number. Whenever you are asked in the question paper, in any college test, there can be any address in it. If the interviewer is asking you, then he will also have to tell you what the address is because there is no fixed format, but I hope that here we have been clear that whenever a variable is created, a data value is stored inside it. The name of that variable is the memory location.
