se and inside just put the pointer of the file which we have to close. Now the logic behind closing.This is that whenever we open any file, our system comes to give us the resources that you will need this much memory, you will need this resource, you will need that resource because you are going to do an important thing because reading any data from your permanent memory is an important task for the system, so it has given us the resources, but now if the work of our file is finished for us once, that is, we have read it and also written in it, then the work is finished now.We should give those resources back to our system as per our wish. However, even if we do not close the file, there will be no problem, but whenever we write big codes, it is highly advised in it. It is a very good practice that at the end of the program, when you have finished working with the file, then you must close the file because the resources of your system are being lost.
