whatever number you write inside that line tells us about which position of the number in the array. If we talk about which number in the array, then whatever number we write inside square brackets tells us which number in which position in the array we are talking about. What do we do once we input and output an array for example?Let us see, for example, there was a Marx array, we will talk about its syntax as well, but let s remove it from here for a while and comment it out. First of all, let s create an array with the name Marx, the size of this array is three. Now we will input the marks of all the three subjects one by one, so first of all we write print statement, enter physics, scanf, first we will put percentage D because we are scanning an integer, then we will put the address of operator end.Marks of zero, after that the same process will be repeated three times.
