next question which we will talk about, the next question says will the address output be the same. Inside this question we haveFunction we have created a void print address in which we are passing int n and what does our function definition say print the address of n. We have taken a variable n inside the main function. We have printed the address of n here. So there will be a memory location inside our memory which we have named n. Value is stored inside n. Suppose the address of four is 2000 so whenever you have to analyze and not the output.Will it be the same or what should be the output of this question, then take an example and in the example, assign any of your addresses, so here we have assigned 2000 addresses, so here we will have 2000 printed, we know this, then we have called, passed the print address in it. Now when we have called the print address, let us look carefully, this is call by value, whenever call is by value.
