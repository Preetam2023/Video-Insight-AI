.18 32, then 0 degree Celsius is our 32 degree burst, so this method of calculation remains with us. We will be using this formula, which creates a function which will calculate the Celsius value.Will take and convert it into Fahrenheit, then we write this function. First of all, we will declare the function. Our function will return a floating value to us. The name of this function is Convert Temperature. In Convert Temperature, we have taken a floating value from it which is Celsius. Now let us define it as Float Convert Temperature and inside it we have got the value Float Celsius which will convert us from Celsius to Fahrenheit.If we want to convert then what will be int Fahrenheit? Our value of Celsius will be multiplied by 9 5 plus 32. So if we see the prefix, first of all it will be multiplied, after that our value will be being added and it will not be integer but we will write it as float and will be returned. Our value of Fahrenheit will be returned.
