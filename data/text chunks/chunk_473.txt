x is our first value and the second value which has to be exchanged is how to find the second value. Second value is for rows.Meaning zero will be the second value for the eighth index. Five will be the second value for the first index. For four second index the second value will be three. So we are able to see that if this value is i then this value is our n i 1. I hope you have understood this thing. Let s make it a table and see what we will do in the table. We will write the value of i. We will write the value of n i 1. Now we know that i is starting from our row.And the value of n is constant. Which is six then the value of i. If it is row then the value of n i 1. We have 5. If there is one then the value of 6 i 1. We have 4 i. If it is 2 then the value of 6 2 1. We have 3. So the pair is formed. The index for row is five. The index for one is the index for two. The index for two is three.
