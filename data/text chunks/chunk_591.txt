entire variable and this is just a way to display a single parameter. Now let s save it and run it. So the first time the roll number was printed for us, the second time also the same value of the student was printed for us but this time we got it printed with the help of points.Let me make a small change and try this, if you are writing the code by looking at my screen, then it is possible that many of you students may make this mistake. What mistake do we make? We put this parenthesis here after the star, that is, in some way, we do the thing that the parenthesis has come here and here it has come here. What does this give us? It gives us an error because the star has to be always kept with the pointer because now what is happening is this pointer.
