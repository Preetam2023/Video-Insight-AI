located. So dynamic memory allocation is to allocate memory to a data structure during the run time. So there are two times, one is our compile time and one is our run time compile.That is, when the C compiler is running and it is analyzing how many memories an integer variable will require, how much memory a float variable will require, how much memory a string will require, and then there is our run time memory allocation. Run time means when our code is actually running, when the console window is open, the user is inputting something in it, some output is being produced. The time between the start and end of the program is called run time.We want to do dynamic memory allocation. For this, we need some functions. By using those functions, we are playing dynamic with the memory, so in this topic we will be talking about four functions in this chapter.
