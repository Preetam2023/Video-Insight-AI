de PTR, then we will go to 2000 and store zero there, so this is the way we have done the work here. Now what are we doing with x?If we are printing the value and the value of PTR, then what will be the value of x here? The value of x will be 0 because we have indirectly added Row has been stored, you will notice that there is no line here in which x is written as something but still we have assigned the value to x. How we have assigned it with the help of this line because here we have indirectly accessedNext, what we did is, we code this part and verify it. First of all, we create an integer variable in which we are storing nothing in the beginning and apart from that, we create a pointer with the name PTR. Now what we are doing inside PTR is storing the address of our X and then indirectly storing it inside the address which is on PTR.
