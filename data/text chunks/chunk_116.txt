then it is true and the ending of true will come to us as true, but here we make even one false i.e. write here 3 is greater than false then here the output we will get will come to us then this statement is true, wherever it falls on 5 and 2, it becomes a false, wherever it falls, that means it is completely false, if the end is put, then both of them will be false, then also one of the two will be false.If both are false, only then will it be printed true, then we make a table of the same. Sometimes one or two are your subjects. Even within electronics, within computer science, within IT, a table is made of these three logical operators. And if you have studied logic gates in college, then you will understand what we are talking about. If not, then perhaps you will be studying in the next semesters. So the table is made that first expression and second expression.
