the other file inside our system. Now whenever we talk about files, we always have to remember this.r is volatile, now its contents are lost when the program terminates, that is, as soon as the program ends, as soon as our C program ends, our data gets automatically cleared because our program is inside the ROM, the program is inside the ROM, which means the variables of our program are also inside the ROM, that is why we write the code of C, in which we create a variable of int n, create an array, create our string, all of these are inside the ROM.Come and all of them are in the volatile memory. As soon as your program ends, these variables will also be cleared from the memory, that is why files are used to pass the data. So what to do that if we want our variables, our data should not remain in the memory and should go to some permanent storage. If we are able to store that data in some way or the other, then for that we use files.
