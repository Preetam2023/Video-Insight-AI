know the size of this string as m n 1, but by default we keep its size as 100. Now let s run a loop.Where will the loop start? The loop will start from i n and our loop will go until our i is equal to m and here we are assuming that no one will do any mischief while calling the slice i.e. n and m which are n and m are valid values. It is not like that a, so g has given the value after the null character, n has been given a negative f. It is not like that, only valid values have to be given which if it comes somewhere in the middle of the string then from n.Here our loop will go till m and what will we do inside the new string, let s create one for the new string also, starting from j 0 and j will be our bar plus this j which is the index of our new string, new string of j is equal to at of aa. I hope this thing will be clear that j is the index inside the new string and i is the index inside the string. Let us see this in the form of an example to see what we want to do.
