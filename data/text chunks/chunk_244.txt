y loop run here.If I multiply two five times as much as my number is, then I will get the answer 32. Keep in mind that I am creating a new variable here, I am not using power one, I am not using two only, I will not modify two again and again, it will get into big trouble. Okay, so this is a very good thing, I am going to tell you here that what is power one, now once I have given you a little hint, I have told you the whole code, by the way, try solving it yourself.Then I will show you the entire solution of what I am trying to say. Okay, now I will show you the complete solution. First let s go straight to the code. Now you must be a little advanced in the code, so I have hope in coding. Here we write that power is ok dot C because we have to extract the power a ray to power b. So here we write the entire code once again in which we will have to write a few things. Okay, no one, first we would take a number.
