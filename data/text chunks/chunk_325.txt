the natural numbers till n 1, so we took that and stored it in this variable and then the sum of n.What is the sum up to n 1 plus n in that, then we stored both of them in the sum of n and returned the sum of n. Now what will be the base condition here? Every time the value of our n will go to 1, then the base condition will be if the value of a becomes one. In that case, we know what is the sum of one, otherwise y will directly return the answer f is one. Let us save it and call it in our main function.Let s print a sum is percentage. First of all we have to calculate and print the sum of 1 to 5. Let s save and run. So till five, the sum of 1 2 3 4 5 has come to us. We have got 15 and how could it have come. Let s analyze it once. So what did we do first of all? We called the sum of five. I thought that first of all I should calculate the sum of four.What will I do in it, I will add five to it.
