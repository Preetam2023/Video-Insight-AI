a way is multiplying it 4 by 4 and storing it back at the same location which is at the address end.And then we stored that value, now what did we do, when we went back, that value got changed because we made changes directly inside the address, here we made changes inside the copy, but in this function, we made changes inside the address itself, so when we went back here, the value of the number had changed, let s understand this with the help of a little diagram and understand what happened to us, we had a variable whose name was number.The address will be, suppose its address was 2000. Now the value was stored inside the number. We made a function call. In the function call, we created a pointer. What did the pointer do? The pointer has kept its name as n. The pointer has stored the address of 2000 because we had passed the end number. We will carefully look at this function of ours.
