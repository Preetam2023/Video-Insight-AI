is sum. In it, it has taken integer a and integer b, so we have taken our a and b and called it sum. The definition of sum says that the value of a will be sent first of all, its value will be copied inWe got the value printed, so this is our entire function which works with parameters and return value. Now as we have written the code to print the sum, apart from this, take one more code. Let s see what that will do. Let s create a function which will print out a table of our number n. So, let s make a few changes inside this code. We will be entering a number. We entered n, scanned it and stored it inside our variable n. Now let s create another function whose name is void print table and inside this function we will send a variable int n. Now it is not necessary that we name it n here, we will call it x.
