is code is that it will print hello world on the screen, so let s see how we save it and any C code.To run, we have to go up to the terminal and we will open a new terminal. In the new terminal, first of all write a line gcc h s. Here this GCC is our compiler of c. So we are evoking that compiler and after that we will write the name of our file. So basically what we are saying is that compile the code in the file in which we have written. This word compile is such a difficult word, isn t it, it will also be cleared by the end of chapter one, then the file.We have compiled it, now we will run it, how will we run the code, we will write add out this a. By default a file is created whose extension is dot out i.e. dot output. If we run it then it will print Hello World for us. Now the coders who are on Windows will have to write here a. a.exe because by default in Windows a.If we learn a little coding now, we will discover how much we can learn from it.
