ning tree and these edges are called called as back edges so for this graph we can make a tree like and perform pre order so this is the pre order of this tree see 1 4 3 10 then 9 then 2 8 756 1 4 3 9 8 2 so 9 2 8 756 so this is like pre order traversal now I will write few more valid depth for sear ch directly looking into the graph I ll start from vertex one one this is the first one from one I ll go to two from two I ll go to 8 from 8 I will go to 7 from Seven I ll go to five then six from six I cannot go anywhere come back to five two is already completed s also completed so what was the root I have taken so come back to 7 7 is completely explored come back to eight nothing remaining come back to two so from two I ll go to three then nine nothing is there come back and go to 10 then go back to three and go to four then one is already explode so return back to four then three then two then one finished so this is one answer then one more I ll show I ll start from vex three first is
