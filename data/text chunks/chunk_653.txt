y three times. Let s save and run it once. First of all, 1 2 3 has been read for us and it has come.What did you do with 12 and 23? We stored 456 inside an integer and got it printed. Then we stored 898 inside a single integer and got it printed. So here, if the floating values were strings, we have other types of integers, then we can scan all the things that are there with scanf and print them on our screen, not with scanf, but with scanf.Which is used exclusively for files. Now just as we can read data from a file, we can also write the data. Our function used for writing is F Print F. Inside F Print F also we have three parameters which are passed. The first one is our file pointer and the second one is our format. The value of the variable has to be printed on this format specifications. So let s try this also. What will we do with our file i.e. test file.If we are going to write something stored inside, then let s remove it here, then first of all we write F print F F print F.
