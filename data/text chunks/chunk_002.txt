is the del keyword del keyword is used to delete object properties or the entity itself any object.If we create an object inside the code, then what it does is that some space is occupied inside the memory because there are some methods related to the object, its many different attribute attributes take up space inside our memory, so many times it may happen that we have created an object which we never want to use later, then we can individually delete its properties and also delete that object.We will have to write this keyword simply DL and after that we can delete the properties in this way. By attribute we can also delete our complete object. Let s try to create a student object. If we have created student class inside it let s create our constructor in it.
