issue of accuracy and reliability of LLM. With this, LLMs are able to answer general prompts faster. When something has to be generated on a current or more specific topic, then this technique becomes even more useful. There were a total of 12 people who developed Ruck, the main of which was Patrick Lewis who coined the name Ragna. Lewis and his 11 colleagues together created it so that generativeAI services can be linked to external resources, especially those with the latest technical details. Louis wrote a paper with his colleagues in 2020. In it, Rack was called a general purpose fine tuning recipe because almost any LLM can be connected to practically any external resource.So that users can check any claim themselves, this builds trust on the models. A very good and useful example of this is Perplexity AI which is an answer machine type model. It is a combination of RUGS and LLM where users can ask anything and the model answers them with sources.
