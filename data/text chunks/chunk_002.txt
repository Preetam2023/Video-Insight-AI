is the del keyword del keyword is used to delete object properties or the entity itself any object.If we create an object inside the code, then what it does is that some space is occupied inside the memory because there are some methods related to the object, its many different attribute attributes take up space inside our memory, so many times it may happen that we have created an object which we never want to use later, then we can individually delete its properties and also delete that object.We will have to write this keyword simply DL and after that we can delete the properties in this way. By attribute we can also delete our complete object. Let s try to create a student object. If we have created student class inside it let s create our constructor in it.

issue of accuracy and reliability of LLM. With this, LLMs are able to answer general prompts faster. When something has to be generated on a current or more specific topic, then this technique becomes even more useful. There were a total of 12 people who developed Ruck, the main of which was Patrick Lewis who coined the name Ragna. Lewis and his 11 colleagues together created it so that generativeAI services can be linked to external resources, especially those with the latest technical details. Louis wrote a paper with his colleagues in 2020. In it, Rack was called a general purpose fine tuning recipe because almost any LLM can be connected to practically any external resource.So that users can check any claim themselves, this builds trust on the models. A very good and useful example of this is Perplexity AI which is an answer machine type model. It is a combination of RUGS and LLM where users can ask anything and the model answers them with sources.
