have asked a lot of questions, we have read a lot of concepts, here I would request a little light.You have to take a break, you have to drink some water, you have to refresh yourself a bit and after that you have to do your homework problems, you have to sit and revise your notes a little, so now we are going to start our chapter six, which is named Points, now points are a very important topic whenever we talk about C or C , because the core of programming has taught us how the things are actually going on in the memory.At the same time, the topic is a bit complex in the points, some people find it very interesting, some people find it a bit difficult, but in this video we are trying our best, that is, I am trying my best to explain the points very well, after which all the questions should be easily solved. We will be covering all the basic concepts.
