s still 2000 but the people living inside it have changed, that is, now we have made 16 out of four. Now whether we are in the square function, in the main function or in some new function, now that value has changed permanently inside this address, now the old value will not come back, so in this way when we change the addressAnd we pass a pointer variable and stores it and we can make changes within the address itself, we call it call by reference, that is, the function call we saw here is called call by reference. We pass the address of the variable as argument. We will pass the address of our variable as the edge argument, it will be stored inside the pointer and when we can make changes inside the original value, that is called by.For reference, these are two types of our function calls. The best example to learn this and understand it better is our swap function. Swap two numbers a and b. This is our next question.
