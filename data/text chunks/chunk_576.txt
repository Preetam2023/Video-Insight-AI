e writing this syntax yourself for the first time, then you have to write it by typing, not copying. In the beginning, if all three students learn a new thing, then do it in a very basic way instead of copy pasting, so it will be remembered for a longer time. So in this way, if you make three students, then how to use our structure, how to access its values, how to declare it.We will remember it, so if you are learning the structure yourself for the first time and are questioning yourself, then you have to write it basic, that is, do not copy the values of all three students. Now it has become S3 in all three. Here we change the roll numbers and our CGPA. We save and run it. So first of all we got the values of the first student, after that the values of the second student came and after that that of the third student.Now the values have arrived, we can change its formatting as per whatever we want to display.
