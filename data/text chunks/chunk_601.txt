our name at home, the name by which we are called is hardly our real name. Everyone has a nickname. It is like suppose your friend is Suresh and his nickname is Chintu. Now we would like to call him by the name of Chintu. It will be better to use his name. If we call him by his official full name then the same work is done. The work of our type deaf type deaf is to create nick names. Nick names i.e. aliases are when there are spies for a person, just like you must have seen James Bond.The alias is whether it is 007 or James Bond, we don t even know whether it is his real name or not, so all the movie actors who have played that role have their name James Bond, so we can assume that James Bond is like an alias, that is, it is a nickname for that character, it is not necessary that it is his real name, so what are aliases? Alias is an alternative, a different name by which we call the same thing, so if weIf we have to create an alias for our data types, then we use our type def keyword.
