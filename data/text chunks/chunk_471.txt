ss array would have been like 1 2 3 4 and five. In this too, the same strategy would have been used. If you had exchanged one and five, here would have been five. Here would have been one. If you had exchanged two and four, here would have been four. Here would have been two. And if three had been exchanged with three, there would have been three. What was learned from this that the final array that came was 5 4 3 2 and 1, so our array should be completely reversed.So whenever an array has to be reversed, a list of numbers has been given to reverse them, then what to do is exchange the first with the last, exchange the second with the second last, exchange the third with the third last, exchange the fourth with the fourth last, then the first one will go back, the last one will come forward.
