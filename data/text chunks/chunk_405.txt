we will put the value at address of b. Now in the value at address of b we will put the value of t. So what we did here is the pointer which is pointing towards a. Where the pointer of a will take out the value of a and put it inside t. Now the value at address of a will come inside t. The value which is inside b will come inside a and the value at address.The value which is stored inside t will come in the value at address of b, so in this way we are doing address by address springing. Now let s check it again here, let us underscore it, now we have printed the value of x and y. Here we will have to pass the address ofGiven that the value of x is now five and the value of y is now three, it is possible to call by reference.
