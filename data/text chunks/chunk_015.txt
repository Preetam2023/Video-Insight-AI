then one finished so this is one answer then one more I ll show I ll start from vex three first is three then I ll visit to four then one then two then five then six from six and cannot go anywhere come back to five come back to five and go to S then 8 right from eight I back on two but is already over so complete go back to seven then five then come back to two then two from there I have already gone to um one one is already completed right so come back to four then come back to three so from three who are remaining 10 and N so 10 then nine this is also valid so you can start from any vertex you like and you can visit any neighboring vertex but only thing is once you have visited a new vertex suspend the exploration of current vertex and start exploring new vertex that s all about def first search and breath first search and the time complexity of both these methods is order of n n is number of is
