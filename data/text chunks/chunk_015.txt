efault in Windows a.If we learn a little coding now, we will discover how much we can learn from it. We can make all the interesting things, so we have written our Hello World program inside it, what is main, what is include, why is hash written here, why is zero written here? We are going to understand the meaning of all these gradually. Now in our chapter one, we will read some basic concepts, after reading which we will start understanding programming.
