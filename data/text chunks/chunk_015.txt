inherit the things from grand parent to child. What is inheritance, similar concept of inheritance. When we pass anything from one generation of class to another generation of class, we call it inheritance. Now, what does it mean in programming? It means this.That when one class is derivative of another class for example inside the car which is a car, there will be a different method for how the car starts, there will be a different method for how the car stops and there can also be a color property inside this car, then the logic for starting and stopping the car is already written inside the car. Now, what can we do with the own car factory? We have written inside the code what we will do with that logic, the inheritance logic.We will derive it from the car class and how will we take it when we or methods methods also, we see inheritance.
