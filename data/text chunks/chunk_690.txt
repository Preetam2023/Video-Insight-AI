he beginning itself and it knows that the C compiler knows what is going to happen with this memory. It has seen that no one is disturbing this memory, so it frees this memory after the second line so that the program does not hold up the unnecessary resources.Dynamically, the C compiler does not know anything about the memory you allocate, so what happens in that case, if you allocate any memory through malloc or calc, then the C compiler does not know whether anyone is accessing that memory in the code, whether any changes are going to be made in it or not, that is why it keeps that memory as it is, then the responsibility here falls on the programmer that our work is done.Then free that memory. If we are not using that memory, then we can free it in the middle of the program that now we do not use this variable. You free this memory and to free it, we use function free, so we use it to free memory that is allocated using malloc and calc and it has a very simple format.
