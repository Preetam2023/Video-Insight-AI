floating value. Square area will come in. We have the parameter float side is the area of a square. Side multiplied by side, so from here we will directly return side.Multiply by side Now we will write the area of a circle, so first of all float circle area will come in, we will have the floating value its radius, then we will also write its definition, float circle area will come in, float radius will return what is the area of the circle, we will have p r s so 3.1 4 multiply by radius in radius, now let s create another function which will calculate the area of the rectangle, float rectangle area, two values will come in it, float side A and float will also return this.The type is done, we gave it the name float, rectangle area, two values will come inside it, first of all we have side A and then side B. What is the area of the rectangle?Float b 10.0 Now let s print the value of our area. Area is percentage f.
