pointer is pointing to that size, we printed whatever values were there and then freed that memory. Now we are giving access to the same pointer on the memory of two sizes and then now we are getting its values printed. So first we want to take the memory of four integers, then these four integers got printed for us, then we freed the memory, now we have it.If there is memory of total two integers, then zero will be printed, so I hope that we are able to see the benefit here that if there are integer pointers then we are usually not able to make any changes in it, but with dynamic allocated memory, we are able to free it in the middle of the code, we are able to allocate it. Next let s ask a question, the question is, free the memory allocated with calc, so we have freed this memory. Already, we ask this question.Done, let s talk next about Reloc Reloc means reallocation of memory i.e.
