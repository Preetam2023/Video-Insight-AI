erstood the difference between those two. The next question which we will talk about is create a 2d.Array storing the tables of two and three means we have to store the tables of two and three, so for this we have to create a 2D array. Our array will look something like this in which here we will store the table of two and here we will store the table of three. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 So to store the tables in this way, if we want to see what will be its size, then we need two arrays and the size of both is 10.If we want to store multiplication table up to 10, then we will have to create an array, let s name it tables, an integer 2d array whose name will be tables and its size will be 2 times 10 in which two arrays will be created and the size of each array will be 10, so this is the first array whose size is 10 and the second array whose size is 10. Inside this we will be storing the values in this manner. Let s write the code for this. First of all create an array named tables.
