ing a loop, first of all make a loop inside this function. The value of i will be starting with one.And the value of i will go up to 10 and every time we will do i pps, every time we will be printing i in n, so this is our print table function, inside which we have written our entire loop to print the table, then we are writing the loop inside the function, now what will we do with this function, we will call it from the main function, print table and will pass our variable n in it. Whenever we call any function and we are passing our variable in whatever is there, then hereThe variable we are passing is called argument and the variable that comes here is called parameter, that is, the variable which we write in the calling statement is called argument or it is also called actual parameter. Argument or actual parameter. Why actual parameter because it is the n in which the actual value will be. This is the n which will tell which table of numbers is to be printed. This is its function.
