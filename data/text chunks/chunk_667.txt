is name is itself a pointer, so there is no need to put em percent here, let s clear it and now run. So, we have entered the name, we have entered the age, we have entered the marks i.e. CGPA and now automatically the file has been created for us which is Student, our name.Then the tab space has come, then the edge has come, then the tab space has come, then our marks have come, in this way we can format our data. If we had to format this data in a different way, then here we would have written the student name, after that, we have written the student age and all the information which is there, in the next next line, we have to do it and here we write student CGPA. Let s save this once, let us run it again, we have written the name.Entered our age again. Again we entered the marks. This time our file was already created whose name is student.
