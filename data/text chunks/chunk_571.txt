If we directly think that we will simply write s1 here and will not use dot, that is, along with this, we will print only the value of s1, after that we are going to print the roll number of our student, percentage D to s1 dot roll end and after that we will print the CGPA percentage of our student as f s1 sj p and at the end of all we will put back sl n. Do this.
