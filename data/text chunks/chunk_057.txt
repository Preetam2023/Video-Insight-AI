rint F. Enter the side. Now take it from scan F. As the input, we will write percentage D. End side. Now we can print the area is percentage D. Side into side. Save it and open your terminal and run it on our side. We enter four.Our area is 16 of the square because 4 4 e 16. Now here it is not necessary that our side should be an integer, it can also be our float value. If the side is our float value, then in this case here percentage f will come instead of percentage d. Here also percentage f will come because if two floats are multiplied then a float value is produced. We will save it and run it again. So now if the side weEnter four, we will get the area is 16.00, so it automatically converted four into float internally. Now the next practice question which we are going to do says write a program to calculate area of a circle. It is written here on the side that we have given the radius of the circle and we know the area of a circle. We have Pa r s, so we know the value of Pa.
