nt A, percentage D, also give a space and print A, so if you run this exact code, this is our A will be printed in this.Let s try this, inside this AP here we have to keep it till n, okay up to the end terms which we will input from the user, so see if I write Ta 4, here I write 3n 1, I had written minus here, I am so sorry ID P comes 3 P then come back here Aa Aa P 3 enter number 10 then see 4 7 10 10 such terms are printed if IWrite enter number here again 50 then 50 such terms are printed see this whole thing is printed upto 50 so that s enough friend our good thing but here is just one problem what is happening with us that I have to apply mathematical formula look one thing is clearly visible what is our first term and another thing is also visible that what is our difference anyone can find this but This is the maths that we used here. This is the extra maths that we used.
