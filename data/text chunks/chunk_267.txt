the function, how to tell void print hello, after that we will be actually creating our print hello. We are creating this print hello below our main function, now we are creating it above also, but whenever we create above, you do not need to tell it separately.But by the way, the syntax is a bit traditional. Following the traditional way of writing, we will be creating our functions below the main. Inside this class, we will write void print hello, after that, Panis, then our curly brace. Now compare this print hello with this main function, so first of all it has a return type, so it also has a return type, meaning main returns our integer, print hello does not return anything, its name is main, its name is print hello.After this, we have put Pansies in both of them and curly braces in both of them and inside the print hello we will be doing our work which is print F world, so in this way our print hello function prints hello to us from hello world or let s save it.
