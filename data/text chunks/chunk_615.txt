e sum of these two comes out to us x1 x2 i ca That is, it will be stored inside a separate variable. y1 y2 j cap and it will be stored inside a separate variable, so the value of one variable goes to the same, the value of the other variable goes to the same, so in this way we will sum it. If we do it with the help of code, then we will understand things in a better way. First of all, what do we do, let s create a structure for the structure vector. Now a vector has two components.There will be an x component, there will be a y component, so here we will write intBut if we create theDon t forget here that we have to calculate a sum vector of these two vectors. For the sum vector, first create a strict vector sum. Initialize the sum with zero, that means there is no value in it right now and we have to create a function to calculate the sum. So we write void calculate sum in it. Three vectors will be passed inside it.
