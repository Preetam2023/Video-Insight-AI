t 6 5 5 5 4 4 3. Now it is a simple thing, friend, 3 ft is our 3 2 ft, so look at it like this, 3 2.Let me quickly explain, okay, our 2 factorial is 2 1 factorial, 2 1 factorial and 1 factorial is nothing, it is only one, so look, our 1 factorial is only one, only okay, so tell me one thing, we just have to print all these things, what is happening at every step, let s come to this code, once here, if you have paid attention a little carefully, when I was dry running this code, then the value of the first product of mine was one.Look again, my value became one, then the value became two, then the value after the cut became six, then it became 24, then 120, so the value of the product was getting some factorial all the time. Listen back to this thing, the value of the product was one. First of all, the value of the product went back to one, then i 2, then the value of the product became two. Look, after i 3, the value of the product became 6s. Value of the product at i 4.
