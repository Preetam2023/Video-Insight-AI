ses, statement terminator can come after parentheses, hence it has come here, so this is our syntax. Now if we have to write the code to print the numbers from one to five, then at the top, we will define our variable i 5, after that we will write in do do, tell our work, what is the work, to print the value of i, we will write the value of this variable.Print statement print f percentage d b n i and now we have to tell the condition. This work has to be done till the value of our i remains equal to 5 and here we will put the condition of updation in between i.e. i p. So we have written this i 1 to 2 3 4 5. The code to print these five numbers is also run once. First of all we will write doo doo, what will it do?Now we should have the variable ready to work, so let s initialize it with one.
