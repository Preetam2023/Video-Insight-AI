h we are using the function has come from the method h itself. Now we have the power if we print it.So the power of 1 and we already know that we will have only one printed, we want to print the power, we save it and run it, so we have one printed and here, if we had written b, if we save it and run it, then what output will we get, we have the output ro, now why is this row coming, we should have got an error because power does not actually exist, this operator which is there inside the na, says this.We are going to learn about JOR later. We know about JOR operator. We know that every number inside c is understood by the machine. What code does the machine understand? What code the machine understands is the machine code which is written in zeros and ones. So whenever we perform operations between zeros and ones, those are our bitwise operations. So, this is our JOUR operator which is based on bits.It is performed in between the bits i.e. in between the same bits.
