ll be the 100 term of this series, then of course you will make a code for it, which is what we are doing here, then how will we do this, friend, we will find some pattern.What is going on here is the pattern. So we have seen what is going on. The pattern here is that any term is equal to the sum of these two terms, meaning if I pick up the A term, suppose I want the eighth term. Okay, the eighth term, then what will be the value of the eighth term? The sum of the two terms before that is 8 13 21, so we can write this as sixth term or seventh term plus.The sixth term is anything like this, the two previous terms are fine, the sum of these two is always valid. 89 this plus this. If you add these two then you will get the acceptance. Like this is valid here also 2 1 1, but we have to assume that our first term is one and the second term is also one.
