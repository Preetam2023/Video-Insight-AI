y time we kept adding that i to the sum, then the sum of all the i s was found out and then printed.Got the value of our final sum done in the same way. First of all if i was 1 and the sum was row then first of all sum sum i so our sum became one. Then if i was 2 then the sum became one. As soon as we went inside the loop the value of the sum became three. Then i increased and became three. The value of the sum was already three. Now if three was added inside the sum then the sum finally became six. So this would be the answer for our n 3. Now the second part of this question says this.Also print them in reverse i.e. we have printed the numbers from one to n, the numbers which we have taken sum, also print those numbers in reverse, how to print them in reverse, let s make another separate loop for that, if suppose we have printed the sum, now for int i n i until our greater than is equal to 1 i minus and every time we will print f, the percentage d n of our i.
