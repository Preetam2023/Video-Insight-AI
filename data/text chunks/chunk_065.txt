rs will work very well. After that, what can we do if we are writing in this way also int c b 1 i.e. it is a variable already declared, you are adding something to it or else ifIf it would have been 1 or it would have been multiply by 2 or divided by 3, then also in this way, if we do operations in Arith on the right hand side and then assign it to c, then that is also valid. That is also absolutely correct. Let s see by actually writing this in the program. If c is equal to 2, if b is multiplied by 6, then no error has come to us because there is a valid statement and another type of valid.What can be the instruction? Int d 1 e. In this, what happened to us is that we declared a variable d to which we gave the value one. Along with this, we declared another integer variable e but we have not given any value to e yet. So this is a valid statement where the value of d is being assigned but not to e. We can also check this by writing in the code.
