se you have mistakenly labeled i, then what to do then you will see what is the problem in the code. If the answer of 16 is coming or 64 is not coming anywhere then you can check that of course, ok then that s enough.Fairly friend, our question was simple, if it is not written here, can I give you homework? Suppose I have given you the base 2 and have given you the power n. Okay, so what you have to do is power of 2, 1 to the power of 2, power of 2, 3 to the power of 2, 4 to the power of 2, 5 to the power of 2, 6 up to the power of 2, n, you have to print everything in different lines, think yourself how to do it.Again, it is very simple, our values are changing again and again inside the loop. Pay attention, all the values of power are becoming powers of two. Okay, let s do one thing. Now friend, let s go back to the code. Once again in the code, friend, let s enter one and see what it means. I enter enter base to power and then the answer is 2 to the power 1 is 2.
