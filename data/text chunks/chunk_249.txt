s way the value of the final factorial will be the factorial of our number, so let us try this also. To code the code, first of all we have to create a number int n then we will print it enter the number after that we will scan our number as percentage d m percent n and now what we will do is run a loop.Before running the loop, let s define another variable int factorial 1. Now inside the loop, first of all we will initialize i with one i i n i p and what is the work of the loop is to calculate factorial then factorial i is equal to factorial multiply by i and at the end we will print the value of our final factorial. Final factorial is percentage d which is r fact. Now one thing factorial.What we have to be very careful about is that the value of factorial does not multiply but increases as if there is very little change in the sum.
