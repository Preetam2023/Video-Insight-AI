if we save it, the output will be 4, but if 2.0 is multiplied with two, then here this error comes. Why did the error come in the first place, because the output should have been a float value, but we said that the output will be an integer value, so now we have to change it to f. Let s save it and do it again. After running the output, we got 4.00, whatever float we have.By default, after all the number of days we get, if it was 2.0 2.0, then what would have happened in that case. In that case too, we would have got the same output. What is a float value? Now instead of this operation, we can also use divide. If suppose we were dividing four by 2.2, then in this case also the output should be float. Because we have one operand of float, then a float value has come in the output. So type conversion is done in this way.
