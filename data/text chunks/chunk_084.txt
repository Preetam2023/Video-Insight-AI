line three as many as we want then all these will be repeated as many times as we will put the loop. Already we have discussed like coming to this code for aa this one so look here it is getting printed again and again and this which is a a 3 this is also loop again and again.Every time it is going on, this thing is going on inside it, let s go ahead, friend break o ho ho, very cute question, now I am going to solve for you the question of loops which is ours. If you have ever written a write a program, then it means write a program to check if a number is a prime number and not. This is a very cute thing. This is how we solve it using the break statement. So, let us read our break statement with this question.The question given to me is to write a program to check if a number is a prime number and not. So, first of all, let s talk about what is a prime number. Now here I will expect from you that you have studied so much maths of second third class that you know a prime number.
