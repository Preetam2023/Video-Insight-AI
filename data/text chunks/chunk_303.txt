is is a property that no matter how many changes you make in the same variable inside the functions.But there will be no change in the value of the original argument which was there at the time of calling, so if there is any wrong code written in your function due to which suppose there are some issues and there the value of your variable becomes zero, becomes negative or goes wrong, then your main function will not be affected because all the code inside it is correct and the values will be correct, then from here comes this property that changes to parameters in the function.The changes that occur in the parameters do not change the values. Inside the calling function, they do not change the value of the argument and why this happens. The reason behind this happening is because a copy of the argument is passed to the function. Whenever the main function calculates its price from Calculate Price, it sends the value to it, but this value is not a copy, it is the original value.
