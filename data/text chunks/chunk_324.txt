we will write the logic from here we will take n.Trust is a very big factor in the sum of recension. We have to have faith that our recurs function will do the work for us, so here we have to have faith that the sum of n 1 values will bring us the sum of recension, which can be a little tricky topic, but the more we solve its questions, the more we will understand what is meant by recjan, what is the logic of calling itself, then sum is the solution.Sum of n 1 What will we do after that, which will be our total sum, the sum till a will be the sum of n 1 n right and this function will return the pass and give us the sum of n. So once again let us understand a little bit about the work of this function is that it will give us the sum of all the natural numbers from one to n. So, first of all what we do is take the sum of the natural numbers till n 1, so we took that and stored it in this variable and then the sum of n.
