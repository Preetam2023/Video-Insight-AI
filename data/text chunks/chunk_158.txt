ng the basics of loops, so let s start with the questions. Let s start with the very best questions.Which are going to happen through operators, let s move ahead friend, so our first question is write a program to count the digits of a given number, very excellent, very beautiful question, so basically assume that I have been given a number, n is 1 2 3 45, okay, this is my number instead of 1 2 3 4 5, if I write anything, let s say 19325, then the number of digits of anything will beI have to count and tell you what I can see 1 2 3 4 5 I can see clearly but how can the computer recognize it or if I put any input and the computer gives the answer then how will we solve it friend first let me give you a hint friend what is the hint hint here it is going to be that you will have to use the division operator, okay the division operator and the second hint is that if you ever get any numberWhen you divide an integer by 10, an integer is an int data type, in a computer, the last digit is rem
