R operator which is based on bits.It is performed in between the bits i.e. in between the same bits. When you do an assertion, its output comes to us. We will be reading about bit wise operators later, but for now, if we try to write b to the power c, it is a valid statement. It is not so. Compiler r will give us an error, but the output we will get is wrong to the power of b. Our output will not come, the output will be something else, that is why we will not write it if we want to show the power.If we want to show power, then we will have to use method A and use our power function. The next topic that we are going to talk about is our modular operator, it is also called modular or modelo. It has the sign of percentage, this is our module operator. What does this operator do? If we have written a modelo b, then it will return us a reminder of a did ba b, like if you see some examples of this, there are 4 models.
