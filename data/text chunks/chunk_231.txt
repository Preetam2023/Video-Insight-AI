e number whose value keeps changing and keeps getting updated. So, this number will be our iterator. So what will we do in this code. We will start the value of our iterator from one and take it till 10. We will take it till 10 and get it printed every time. Multiply the item number. So first the number will be multiplied by 2 1 and then it will be printed.It will be printed after multiplying by 2 2, then it will be printed after multiplying by 2 3 and in this way we will print the entire table of our numbers. For this we write the code. First of all we will enter our number. We have entered the number. After that we write a loop for int i 1 till our lesson is equal to 10. i 10 because we are considering the table from one to 10 and we will be printing it every time.Percentage d b n n aa number aa save it and run it, first of all if we enter the number two then the whole table of two will be printed to us. Now the computer will do the work which I could not do and will give it to us i.
