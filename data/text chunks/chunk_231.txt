ecuted this thing many times till now, so this is 2 3 5 8 13 21. The next one will definitely be 34. This is our FINA series, isn t it?Very smartly, we are putting all the Fina s numbers inside our sum variable, similarly inside B we are also putting 1 2 3 5 8 13 and so on, inside this also we will put D and D, but first of all, we are putting all our series in it, okay, we just have to relate it to how much our number is going to be. Pay attention here, what is 21, 21 is my A, Fina s number, here, see, a couple of times, this is our G.The sixth thing is that off course is going to be my eth number. Do you understand what I am trying to say here? Let s code it once and then we will dry run it. I just told you a few things to build it in intuition so that you think a little and okay and straight away we code it. We come here, where did brother go, come to the loop and write here FOC D C is okay and off course inside this also we do some things.
