ge so that is why our number becomes prime. Here in the loop but it is not happening in one but one.What is one is neither prime nor composite, so what do we do in that case, we can know this, see here I write if, let s put a condition here, simple C is fine, here if n is equal to two is equal to two, then here I can print print F, one is neither prime nor composite, composite is fine, but here I have to put the condition of L only, okay because a, in that case.Also, what do you say about us, zero will remain only, right friend, so here I write else if and in the last we write else. Now let s run it once and see if I write one then the answer is one is neither prime nor composite because it is not working in it. Look, if I write enter number two then it is coming prime. If I write enter number five then it is coming my prime. Of course everything will work okay so we look at one.
