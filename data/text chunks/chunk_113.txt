is called not equal to. The next type of operator which we will talk about is our logical operators. Sometimes it happens inside c that we have to check the logic of things like logical.In which cases we can use the statement, let us assume that we have created a system using c, a coding system inside which we are feeding his marks and if we say that if his marks are more than 30 and less than 90 then give him grade a and if it is above 90 or between 100 and 90 then give him grade a p. If we have to check such cases then we will have to check that the marks are 90.If the marks are above 30 or below 100 then you will have to check here. Marks should be above 30 and below 90 only then you will have to give A. So when two conditions have to be checked together or if one of the two conditions is true, like if today is a national holiday or today is Sunday then only we will go out for a walk. If any one of the two things becomes true then we will have to work.
