like we have seen a collection of integers, an integer array, a collection of characters, a string. In the same way, if we want to create a collection which has many different types of data.Let s say we have to store an int, we have to store a character, we have to store a float and also we have to store a string. Now we cannot form an array by combining these four because what is an array? Array is a collection of data whose data type is the same but here we have to create such a collection in which our data types are different. To form such collections, we use structures. If we look at the definition of structures then structure isA collection of values of different data types i.e. you will take different data types and then if you want to keep them within a collection within a structure, then we will call it a structure.
