se I have removed it, I write Enter a number 12 in 12 , then see how many times it has been written. The given number is composite , Composite , Composite , why is it happening that when I give input 12 , it is written four times.The number is composite, I came to know in one go that it is composite because first of all when I tried dividing by two, I hit the yes condition and if the inner line went, then what happened in the next line, I did it with three, still the line went, then one more time, The number is composite, it was written, then again with four, it was written again with five, it was not written, it came with six, it was written again with 7 8 9 10 11, then I tried dividing by 7 8 9 10 11.
