e or alter the flow, we call themare called control instructions that can control the flow of Now these are of four types in a program. The first of these is sequence control. Sequence control instructions are those which keep running sequence wise, that is, one after the other, if our flow is formed, then we call them sequence control instructions. Like we have been learning till now, all these are our sequence control instructions. The second type of control instruction is what we have in decision control, sequence control.We will read about If Else. These are the instructions about which we are going to read in the coming chapters because they have to be discovered in great detail and all of them together form the basics of our C programming. So inside the Decision Control, we will further read the topic of If Else. Inside the Loop Control, we will read about the different different loops in C.
