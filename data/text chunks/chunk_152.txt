e condition is fine and here was our code, okay, here I used to write i ps late and give some value. So I enter this and if this condition is not true then the loop of course will not run, it will run only till the condition remains true while what happens in the do while loop, here first of all we write do then curly bracket curly bracket inside the code just look like do like it is not there in else, similarly here the code is not there any condition then next to this I write similarly while without anything and whatever we get hereBut whatever is written, actually this is a variable, the condition inside a while loop basically has the syntax of do while loop, do is okay, whatever is our code inside here and here I write while condition is okay and this semicalculus here also works exactly the same as while loop, absolutely true, there is no difference, again here also above I will write int int i, whatever we write things and increment.
