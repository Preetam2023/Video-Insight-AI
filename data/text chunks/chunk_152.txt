condition will be checked, if it is not true, then a third condition will be checked, if it is true.Let s say it becomes true then after that there will be no check and if all the above are false then there is no check in the last else else if all the above are false then the work written is done without checking. Now if we want all our conditions to be checked, meaning even if this also becomes true then this thing is still being checked, then in that case we write if, many one after the other, this check will happen ifIf it is true then it will happen, otherwise it will not happen then this check will be done if it is true then it will not happen, it will not happen, it does not matter whether the above one was true or false, then when the above condition does not make any difference to the below condition, then keep writing if again and again and again and again, and if the above condition is making a difference, like if we had to check the marks, then if a p is printed once above,
