e radius of the circle and we know the area of a circle. We have Pa r s, so we know the value of Pa.There is a constant of 3.14 and if we multiply it by r, then in this way we will get the area of a circle. For this, let us change the program a bit or write the float radius and write here enter radius. Now whatever value we will enter, now whatever value we will enter, we will store it in the radius variable. Now we will write area is pi i.e. 3.14 multiplied by radius multiplied by radius because we have to takeWe square the radius and save it. Here we defined the variable, after that we wrote it with print F. We entered the radius on the screen, then we stored the radius, then we stored the area. How to store the area? We multiplied 3.14 with the radius and again multiplied it with the radius. We run it in the terminal. If we enter radius in the terminal, then we get the output that the area of the circle is 28.2.
