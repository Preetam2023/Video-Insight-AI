anyone can find this but This is the maths that we used here. This is the extra maths that we used. Extra maths is okay, basically we had to make a formula, then we had to find out the term which is our condition till now and in this previous question too, this is the condition which is 2n 1, okay 2n 1. We had to make this, can the work be done even without this, absolutely possible, absolutely possible, we will pay a lot of attention here and other methods.We are going to solve this, we will create a new file here, listen very carefully, friend, inside the loops, we will create a new file in which we will write the profit A without maths or means a pattern or sequence without maths, see, we are going to do this here dot C, let s go ahead and start solving this question of ours, okay without using math, so again first of all we will do some things.Let s copy and paste it and see if we can create a difference. Control C, let s make it a little lower here.
