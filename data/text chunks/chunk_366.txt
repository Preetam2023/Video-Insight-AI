a floating variable inside the pointer, you will have to write float star ptr i.e. int edge e equal. 22 If we have to store its address as edge, then we will use this. If we have written character star e equal to est risk, if we have to store its address as a variable, then we will write this and if we have written float price e.Equal to 1, so if we have to store the address of the price, then we will be writing this. The type of the pointer depends on what type you have stored the address in it. If you have stored the address of integer type, then you will have to write int. If you have stored it of character type, then you will have to write character star. If you have stored it of floating type, you will have to write float star. The next thing that we will talk about is the format. Now whenever we print the points, we will have to writePointers are not normal variables.
