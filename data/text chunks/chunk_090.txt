loat to int, it does not round off that if it is 1.99, then make it two and then put two in int jar.It does not apply so much logic like Math, if we have to remove decimals, then it will remove the entire decimal and store only one, so we have to take special care of this thing, whenever we sit in interviews and some such questions are asked to us like tell me in C or in the class test, the question comes that what will we write in its output, then we have to remove our decimals completely. The next topic which we will talk about isLike Operator President, we had read a small rule in Math, which we called Border Mass Rule. Border Mass Rule. What did we say? First open the bracket, then divide, then multiply, then add, then subtract. In this way, if many operations are given in math, then which operation has to be done first, which operation has to be done later, we had a proper series for that, there was a sequence, similarly it is inside C.
