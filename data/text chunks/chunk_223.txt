21 34 is 55, 55, then 34 55 is our 89, so write here 89 and so on. You understand what I am saying. Till here, all the terms are there, meaning you just have to write one in the beginning, then the sum of these two is this, then the sum of these two is this, 2 3 is 5.3 5 8 5 8 13 13 8 What is it called 21 21 P 13 34 And so on So like this you can normally make the series manually but like if I say which term is this, this is my first term, this is the second term, this is the third term, this is the fourth term, this is the fifth term, this is the sixth, this is seven, this is no, this is 10, this is11 and so on, now like how much will be the 12th term of this series, we will have to do the sum of these two, suppose you are asked directly or someone asks you that friend, tell me 15 terms, what will be of this series, then will you keep calculating like this, if someone asks you, what will be the 100 term of this series, then of course you will make a code for it, which is what we are
