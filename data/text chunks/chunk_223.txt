n n remains i p and inside this loop, we will add sum to sum as sum i or we can write this as sum e.i And what will we do in the end, we will print the value of our sum, so the sum is percentage d aa, let s save it and let us run it, here we are going to print the value of the sum, not the aa, in the end, we will enter number number, we enter three, then we have the sum printed and come six. If we suppose we are entering five, then this time we entered five, the sum got printed and came 15, so what was the process in this method.First we entered n and then created sum variable whose value we initialized with row. After that we ran a loop from one to n. What we used to do every time was to print the item mater of the loop. But this time we did something else with that item i.e. calculated our sum. How to calculate the sum. Sum Sum i i.e. every time we kept adding that i to the sum, then the sum of all the i s was found out and then printed.
