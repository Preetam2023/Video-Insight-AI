s do one thing, n and will take n as input from the user. Here, brother, it is not so simple. Int n. Then we write scan F, but before that, let s make it a little beautiful. Print F here, write enter a number. You all know it by now.All these things are fine, then we write scan F and here we write percentage D because it is integer and here we will write end n. Okay, let s run it once and see that we have run it. Look, first of all it is asking for enter number, I have given the number, friend, instead of a , I am writing r . Okay, so look at this, Hello World is printed three times. Do you understand, I will run it back.
