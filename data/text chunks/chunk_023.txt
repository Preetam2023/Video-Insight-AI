it gets updated then how will we write it as age equals 24. So earlier our age variable was 22 i.e. it was stored in the memory location but now after 2 years we have stored it in our age as 24. So in this way any variable can be written.If we can update the value of the variables, they keep changing inside our code and in fact the English meaning of variable is also something which keeps changing, so it all makes sense. Now whenever we write the variable, a special tip is given to every programmer which is being given by a senior programmer that the names of the variables should always be meaningful i.e. we should understand the variable as soon as we read it.
