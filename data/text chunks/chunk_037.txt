utting a semicolon here.But our line is over, now whatever is written next belongs to the next line. After this, we could have written the entire thing here also and we would have known that it is in the next line because it is coming after the semi colon and along with this, all the instructions of our code are case sensitive, that is, if we want to write int main here, then it would be wrong because all these have come in upper case because C is a case sensitive language.What is small will remain in small case, what is upper will remain in upper case, we cannot interchange or replace it, so whenever we create our C program, we always have to include a header file or our preprocessor directive at the top, after that we have to write int main and we have to put curly braces and in between we can write anything but at the end we always write a line with return zeros, it shows the row in the return row.
