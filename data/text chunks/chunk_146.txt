se sl n computer buff. Very very beautiful question. There is going to be a beautiful question here. The output is going to come, what is ours, like it came last time in Malayalam.Infineon is fine for me, I have written i 20 because what is written here and here print F, whatever is written inside, but let s say it is written in it, a computer buff, okay, so this too will run in the infa bar, okay, look, the infyting is also coming, the computer buff is coming, it is not ending, so let s try to go up once, it is going, otherwise this infine is happening that an infa loop is going on, it is okay. In the previous one, I explained that ourThis is going on indefinitely because 97 will always be less than 98 so this condition will always be true so this loop will never end. Similarly what is happening here is int i 10. You will say here it is written that i is equal to 20.
