nts will be printed and if the condition is not true then there is only one statement in this block. Now between these two curly braces comes the chunk of the entire statements, this group comes, we call them block, inside C or any A block inside a programming language is a combination of statements in which we enter many statements, so all three will be executing simultaneously, we save it and run it, compile it, run it, first enter 15 that our age is 15, in this case it is printed as not adult, now if we run it again, this time we will enter age 22 and this time it is printed that we are not adult.They can vote, they can drive, so in the case where we have put that statement which will not be true, that means here it became false, then it went inside else, then not adult, it printed it, but in the case where we put 22 and this condition will be true, then all these statements got executed but together it did not happen, that means this one statement did not get executed.
