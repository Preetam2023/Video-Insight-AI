operand of float, then a float value has come in the output. So type conversion is done in this way.How does type conversion happen? If the compiler sees that the output should be stored in a larger container because it is a larger output, then it does not forcefully store it in a smaller container on its own, that is, it will not store it in an int, it will try to save the entire output, then by default it stores it in a float. Now we can see some more special cases of this, like if we divide two with three, then because both of these are our integer values.The output should be our integer. Once we look here, we will get an integer. So we do this. D output has come to us. Because there will always be an integer output. Now when we divide two by th, then 0 point something will come but because there is an integer value inside it, we store single digits. If our whole digits are not stored, then it will make it zero. Whereas if we had taken 2.0, then we would have taken it as 2.0.
