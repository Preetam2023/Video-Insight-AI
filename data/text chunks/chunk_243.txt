e check at the top. If our a is equal to two is equal to 3, then this unlucky number has come, ours.If we don t get it printed, in that case we will write Continue . If we had written break here, it means that we would have come out of this loop completely, then four and five would not have been printed, that is, three would not have been there, but then F is not there, but we have written Continue . Let s see what output comes from Continue . The output from Continue is 1 2 3. Ours has been skipped and 45 has come. So whenever we have to skip something, there is something special.We want to skip the set of lines, we want to skip them and want to go to the next item, then we use continue there. Continue says, continue further, let go of the current thing, leave the current thing, so this is the basic meaning of our continue. Now if we ask this question, then print all the numbers from one to 10 except for six, that is, all the numbers from one to 10 except six.
