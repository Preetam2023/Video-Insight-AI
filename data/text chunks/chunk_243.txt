solve it, so this is our simple guess that came from the loop, you will think that it can be solved.It is a simple thing, if you want to find out anything, then you have kept the variables A and B, then you just have to do one thing, create a new variable, how much can you get? It s okay with the name var or make it any variable, okay, initialize it with one for once. Then friend, you run your for loop or run any loop n times, whatever is the number of times you want to run it. B times, you run the loop again and again. In this loop, you just write that power e is equal to power in a, which is the base below us. You have to multiply it again and again. Don t you understand? Look at me, the value of power is one and how many times will my loop run here.If I multiply two five times as much as my number is, then I will get the answer 32.
