arrays is then we have taken EC, here we will store the information of 100 children of Electronics. Inside the structure, we have given the number 100, then we will store the information of 100 children of COE, then we will store the information of 100 children of IT, so these are three different arrays, now Student.We have already created the student structure when we used to do Agist. Now here we want that there should be separate information stores for the 100 students of EC, the 100 students of COE, Computer Science and the 100 students of IT. So now you will create different arrays for them and how to access them, we will access in this format that first we have to write the name of the array, then we have to write the index and then dot roll number. So what will happen with this is that we have stored our data inside the memory.
