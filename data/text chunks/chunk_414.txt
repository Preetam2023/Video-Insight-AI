Now hereWe do not need to define because this variable is already created inside the main function. We want to change the star of product because this is the sum, this is the product and this is the average. These are the three points and if we access the value at the pointer with the help of asteris, then we will store it there a p b. We will store it in this product.2 So now let s call do work, we will pass address of sum, address of product and address of our average. After that, when we come to the main function, we will print all the three values. Sum is equal to percentage, product i is equal to percentage d and average is equal to percentage d and here first of all sum then product then average. I hope this thing will be clear to us.
