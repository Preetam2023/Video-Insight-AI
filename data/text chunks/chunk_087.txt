ersion is done in this way. A very interesting question based on type conversion will be solved now. In the question, we have to see the value of int a which is 1.99999. How will it work? If we assign this value to an integer, what will it do? It will remove its decimals. It will remove the decimals, that is, remove this part completely.Here, the value of a should be one or the value of a should be two. We will write that in the code that we will analyze in our code. Int A 1.99 999. Let s save it and now we will print our A and see its value to see what is actually printed. Here first of all it gave an error that the conversion from double to int is not possible, it is implicit conversion.It is not possible whenever there is a type conversion. There are two types of conversions inside C. The first type of conversion is the implicit conversion which is done by the compiler itself and the second type is our explicit explicit conversion. We as a programmer and as a user do it ourselves.
