r loop and another hint that we will solve this question by dividing through factors, now you pause.You can try it, but let me tell you its complete working once, I am going to solve it directly in stages, I will not write the answer to it, comfortably explain one thing to you, you will get the essence of for loop and break statement. Actually, okay, so let s see, what should I do, tell me one thing, like here is my number, if I write 25, then I know friend, this is a composite number, I know this is a composite number.This is clearly known to happen but if I write a very big number 2753 2753 then I don t know whether it is prime or composite, okay then what is the way to check it, if I divide this number from one to whatever number is 2753 and it is not divisible by any number other than one and this number, then it is prime, it is simple, no number is different from itself and one.
