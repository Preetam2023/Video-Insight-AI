ue printed here. 118 will now come back inside the main function. Now again the value will be added.So now 118 will be printed in our console and then after returning our function will end. This is what our logic is telling us. Now if we save and run this function then this time it is printed first of all the final price is 118 but the value is 100. Why is it printed like this? Here inside the calculate price our value is 118 but inside the main function as soon as we are going back the value becomes 100 again.This is happening because whatever change we do inside our other functions like calculate price, whatever change we make in our parameters will not be reflected in the argument, that is, even if you make this value zero in calculate price, it will not be able to change the argument with this value, so this is a property that no matter how many changes you make in the same variable inside the functions.
