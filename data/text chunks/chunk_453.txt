now 12 has come on the first index.13 has come on the second, 14 on the third, 15 and on the fourth. 16, so all these values have been stored inside our array. Now here on star PTR 1, this is done, the way to do it with pointer. Here, we could have also done this on the basis of our index, so this is directly on the index a, whatever value is there, it is on the basis of If we calculate the address as per the address then we save it as well and while taking the input we could have done the same thing i.e. if Aadhaar is off then this Aa will keep changing and if we keep sending the address as per Aadhaar then this would also be the correct format to do things 12 13 14 15 16 So from this also we are able to take the same input and output whether we use points or we use these things normally i.e. square brackets.
