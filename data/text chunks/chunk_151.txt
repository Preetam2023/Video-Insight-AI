if our marks are greater than 90, then you print a and here check that the marks are what they are.Less day is 90 but greater day is 80 then in that case just print a and the output of that condition is true will come inside it. In this way after this we can write one more LCF, we can write as many LCF as we want and after that at the end if we have to do if none of the above is true then do else. In this way, whenever our flow of program is made, we create our if block at the top, after that we create our LCF block, after that we write another LCF, as many LCFs as we want and at the end we write an else, so if you want to use all of them, then the flow will be like this. What will happen in it? First of all, a condition will be checked, if it is not true, then a second condition will be checked, if it is not true, then a third condition will be checked, if it is true.
