ll be converted to our floating values. Let s save this also and run it once. This will be floating.Pointer and we want to print the percentage f, so all our floating values have been printed to us. We can take input from the user or can define our own and then perform different functions with them. Basically, whatever we could do with normal memory, we can do it with dynamic allocated memory. Now next let us understand our calc function.It means continuous allocation i.e. whatever memory you allocate with it will come in continuous fashion like if you allocate 20 bytes of memory then it will be allocated for you in continuous fashion and one more thing is to define the memory through calc and declare and allocate that every value is initialized with zero, suppose you have memory equal to five integers.So by default zero will be stored in all the integer values. If you take equal to five floats then by default 0.0.0 will be stored in it.
