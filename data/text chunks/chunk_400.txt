and understand it better is our swap function. Swap two numbers a and b. This is our next question. Swap means interchange or exchange, like the value of a is three, the value of b is five, then at the end what will the swap function do? It will make the value of a five and the value of b will become three by interchanging.Will give the values of both. Now let s see once how we actually do the process of interchanging. We already have two variables inside our memory. The first is our A variable. The second is our B variable. The value is stored inside A. Three are five inside B. Whenever we have to swap something, we will use a third variable. To understand this, let s take another example like we have a bucket of water.In which 3 liters of water is stored, there is another bucket inside which we have five liters of water stored. Now we have named this bucket, we have named it B. What we have to do is that in A we need 5 liters of water.
