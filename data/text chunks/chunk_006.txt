s do one thing. We go to our desktop and here we create a folder with the name of New Folder Loops. Now go back inside VS Code and you will see that you will get a folder, very good. Inside it, create a new file which is the basis of Loops.D C is fine, a file has been created, now let s put it aside and start our coding, here we write include, then we write atd a, then we write int main function here and here we write our one return zero, okay, suppose you had to print hello hello word, you all know that if you have to write twice or 10 times, then you can do this work. Now you will say, brother, let us do one more thing.You can say, you have to write hello world five times in different lines, you will say here brother, we copied it 1 doti 4 five five times, friend, if we run it, it will come out hello five times, okay but friend, of course, we are not going to copy and paste a thousand times to write it a thousand times, for that, off course, we have some shortcuts which are loops.
