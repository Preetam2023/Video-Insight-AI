The one which is semi sized is called a terminator. Our terminator is that AI robot from the movie. Not Terminator, Terminator means to stop something, so like he came to Apocalypto, what does it do here in the movie, it stops the statement there, so now we do it, compile and run, the output comes to us, we have four second problem, we have 5 2 divide by 2 3 here because there are three operators, the president of all three is the highest, so in this we will apply our associativity rule associativity.What does the rule say, if you calculate from left to right, then first of all we will calculate 5 2. We have 10, then we will divide 10 by 2. We will calculate 5. Now the output is 5. We will multiply it with r and the output will be 15. We will also verify this. We will write the output, divide, compile, run six. This is because here 3 has come.
