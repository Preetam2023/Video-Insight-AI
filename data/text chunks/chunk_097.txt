okay brother, come here, come here, come to your pen copy, I did it, so I made a box late, I did n.I gave the value of n by myself, if I gave it, let s say 6, it is okay or I gave anything, the value of n, if I write a, I write 25, then here is the problem, do you know what is coming, I took the number, everything, enter the number, it came to the output, the loop ran, then in the loop, I told you, first of all, what happens is int i 2, then a box named i is also created, the value of i is two for now and how much of i is mine.i 25 1 then it will go till 244 from two to 24 and our increment is of one each. First check n modus aa 25 modus 2 is divisible by 252 otherwise this statement is over then for loop is over then comes back new round of for loop. We are in for loop as many rounds as there are number of times for loop runs. We call these rounds as actually in.We call rounds as iterations. You must have heard it or read it from somewhere.
