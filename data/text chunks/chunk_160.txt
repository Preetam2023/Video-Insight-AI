does a switch do? If you turn it on, it does some work. If you turn it off, it does not do anything. In the same way, there is a switch inside our coding, which if you turn on the condition, it will give you the work and if it does not, then it will not be your job to write the switch.The syntax is such that first of all we write the keyword, we switch, inside it we write some number or character and basically what the switch does is to match some constants with that number or character, like the number you have given as edge, then the constant becomes ours 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Lad, this is a very impractical case for the switch. In this way, we have got many constant numbers, then whatever your edge is, then it becomes ours.It will match the case, that is, if it has matched your edge with one, you had put one in the edge, it has matched it with one, then whatever is written next to it, it will do that work and give it to you.
