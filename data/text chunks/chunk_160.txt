its answer is F and I will initialize it with what is zero, meaning for once in this, we will count.I am wondering how many digits the number has, I am fine, then what will I do, I will keep dividing like first of all, I did 19325 divided by 10, I did okay, that means I will write like this, I n n diva ba 10, okay, you know the meaning of it, now what will happen in n if n is already in this box of mine, 19325 n n diva ba 10 means 1932 value is put in n.Okay and then I will make my count plus plus, that means I will increase one number in the count, okay and I will keep doing this work as I divided then look at the count, it is like this 1932 is 5 so first of all I divided by 10, 1932 is left in the count, our one came, then I divided one more time by 10, then the number came to 193, I added one more number to the count, then I went back by 10.Divided 19 left, at the same time here I reduced the count to three, then I again divided by 10. 19 10 Our one is 1.
