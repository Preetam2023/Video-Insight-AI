ry whose name will be pointer where we have stored 2000 and it will also have its own location 4010. Now we have made the pointer plus plus, so now we have to tell where the pointer is pointing.By converting the pointer to plus we mean that the pointer is equal to pointer 1, but whenever we increment or decrement the pointers, there is a special thing and their value is not 1 or 1. Whenever and is written, it means to increase a data type, that is, if the pointer is of integer type, then it will increase by the size of the integer. If the pointer is of character type, then it will increase by the size of the character.If the pointer is of float type or double type, then it will increase by that size. Here our pointer is storing the address of an integer, so it means that four bytes will be added to it, like if the value of the pointer was currently 2000 and now we have made the pointer plus plus, then its value will increase.
