alled compound interest. If you want to calculate, then basically you will learn the basics of math.Whatever things can be possible by applying formulas or whatever things can be possible through input output, we can get the code after conceptualizing that method. Now the next chapter is our chapter two i.e. Instructions and Operators. Inside this we will read what is the meaning of instructions and operators in C. Now inside this chapter, we will do a lot of numerical things which will be related to maths, along with this we will also learn many new things.When we will learn the concept, if we are seeing such pages inside the notes in which a lot of information is written then do not worry because there is no need to memorize those things together, all the notes will be available to you below when you feel like doing revision.
