, our loop is not running if we are printing this A. 4 7 10 13 Okay, if we are printing this A here.We are printing 4 7 10 13 up to 151, whatever number of terms we are printing, it does not mean that it is running so many times, our loop is running n times, that is why we wrote that print up to the end terms, so we know that our loop will run so many times, so let us do one thing, we make the loop n normally int i 1 i ele i n and i p p or i i 1Its meaning is clearly that whatever is inside the loop will be printed from i1 to n, it will be printed n times. It is okay. If I run it normally then my normal thing is going to run. Enter number, I write 10, then printing will happen from one to 10. Okay, I write 100 till 100 because this loop itself is running 100 times. Let s do one thing. Let s modify the thing inside us like this.
