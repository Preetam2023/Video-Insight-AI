re, how will we use extra variable, now instead of printing, we have created a new variable of ours.Is int a ok or any name i is equal to 4 with which we are starting now like a we are starting from four so we will do one thing we will store it in a new variable inside four variable its ok and then we will keep printing a again and again ok not i we will print a again and again now see if I write this statement normally then what should be printed according to you suppose I printed it here asked enter number 10 then II will say, A is going to be printed 10 times or four 10 times, look, it s a simple thing, the loop is running 10 times, now A has nothing to do with it, otherwise the thing inside is running 10 times, just I know this and A is written inside, why don t we do one thing, every time the value of A becomes 7, A becomes 10, meaning look here, inside the for loop, we can write multiple lines like Y , this is something right.
