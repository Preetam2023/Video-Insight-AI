program, it is a sequence of instructions, like if we have to make Maggi, then there is a sequence.What are the instructions? First of all boil water, put Maggi masala in it and then put your actual Maggi in it and then let it heat. If you want to make tea then first pour water, put our milk in it, add sugar, add tea leaves, add ginger, then let it boil and then filter it. So these are some sequence of instructions. Similarly, there is a sequence of instructions inside any program which tells the program.What does it have to do? Now when we read the types of instructions, we come across three types in them. The first is the type declaration instruction, the second is our arithmetic instruction and the third is our control instruction. These three instructions have different functions and they are named according to the function, so it is not that it will be very difficult to remember them.
