u can also increase the memory by using the same pointer and size. You can also decrease the memory. Why would you reduce it? In which case would you reduce it? When we took a lot of memory in the beginning and in the middle of the program we came to know that we do not need so much memory. For example, suppose you are running a college for which you have created a system online. You feel that you have launched a digital marketing course and 1000 children have enrolled in it.If you are going to do this, then you have allocated the memory according to the information of thousand children, but if only 70 children came to the event pass, then there is a lot of memory which will be wasted, so what will we do with the rest of the memory in the middle of the code, we will reallocate it. If we keep 70 keys, then this difference will be completely cleared for free.
