y are named according to the function, so it is not that it will be very difficult to remember them. First of all, if we talk about type declaration instructions, then what do we understand by type declaration?Ty type declaration means declaring any variable with its type, so whenever we write such statements, we write such instructions where we have to declare a variable and we have to declare its type, we give it a type declaration statement. We have been writing type declaration statements inside our C code for a long time. We can write it like if we wrote int a 4, this is also one of our type declaration statements, if we haveWritten character c is equal to est risk, this is also one of our type declaration statements, but whenever we write these statements, we make a small mistake that we forget a rule. Our rule says declare variable before using it.
