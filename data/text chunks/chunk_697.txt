nt these numbers, so for that also we write a loop, we will use the same loop again, print F to the number, percentage D is first, so let s save and run. If we have to enter five numbers in the beginning, then we will enter 5 4 3 2 End.One, now we have to enter eight numbers, so 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and 1, so these numbers have been printed for us, number zero is eight, number one is seven, number two is six, number three is five, so this formatting is a little bit bad, let s fix it a little with back slash and in the beginning, we entered five numbers and now we have to enter eight numbers, so all these eight numbers are in our eight memory locations.Next, let s talk about this question Create an array of size five using calc and enter its values from the user, that is, we have to allocate a size equal to five integers from a calc and then get the user to input the values of those five integers.
