ree key table has been printed and how we printed the tables, by storing them inside a 2d array i.e. tables, we called our store table function, calculated the tables and stored them inside it.Printed inside the function and what we got to learn is that whenever we pass a 2D array inside the function, the second dimension has to be always mentioned, so we have read a lot of things about the arrays, we must have given you some questions inside the 2D arrays, we must have given you notes, you can go and see them and I hope that we have a strong grip inside the arrays, that will be coming next increase. We are moving towards our next chapter which is named Structures and Strings. So now we are going to start with our chapter which is named Strings. If we talk about strings then string means a character array terminated by a null character. This is the bar sl 0 that we have shown. This is a null character. Like we write back sl a, it means next line.
