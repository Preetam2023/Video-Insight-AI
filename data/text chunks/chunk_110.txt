printed, then the number is prime, so in the case of 43, what happened is that if instead of 43, suppose my number is 24, which is a composite number.My is 24 so if I divide 24 by let s here pay yr two then it gets hit in the very first condition that yes true break happened but before the break happened as soon as the condition became true then in the box of a instead of row one came break condition then the loop is completely finished and will not go beyond that then directly see is a equal to 0 or else a means anything other than row then print this then the number iscomposite is ok still there is a small flaw in this code first of all tell in the comments if you can identify I put any number in it like if I put 99 then of course that is also a composite number it is divided by 33 if I put a number here 91 then that is also a composite number if I put 93 then it is prime number ok oh sorry 93 is also composite I am so sorry of course I enter the number here 83 ok so that is a prime
