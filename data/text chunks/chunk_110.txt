cause th is never greater than 3. But if we have made 3 greater than equal to 2, then it is greater.Than will check equal to also will check equal to in this case the output will be 1 so this is greater than and greater than equal to is the third relational operator which we will talk about this is our less than is equal to less than and less than is equal to same cases will remain 3 is lane 4 will return true 4 is lane 3 will return false 3 is less than 3 will return this0 and 3 is equal to 3, it will return one i.e. true, let s make cases for them too, if is greater than equal to two, lesson is equal to two, then less than is equal to two, we will have printed true, if only less than is done, then in that case we will have printed row, if 4 3, in this case we will print false because this is a wrong statement, i.e. row, and if we have done 4, lesson 5 will be printed in this case.True, this is how our relational statements work.
