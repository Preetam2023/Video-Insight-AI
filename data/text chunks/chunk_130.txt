output let s go what is less than 10 condition checked yes it is small ok print one ok here we are.You can also put one thing, we do one thing, we put ba n, we put ba s n, okay, print one, give one enter, the next thing to be printed in the next line is i minus the value of i, the value of i has decreased by one, now the value of i has become zero, okay, the value of i has decreased by one, it has become row, then checked whether row is smaller than 10. If it is true, print it, then row has been printed, then given the value of i and reduced the value of i by one more from row.Small 1 Is 1 smaller than 10 Yes, now you must have understood 1 is also smaller than 10 2 will also be smaller than 10 All the numbers are smaller than 10 So a condition is sometimes fulfilled meaning it is always happening What does while mean As long as this condition As long as this is true As long as this condition is followed Keep executing the inside thing So what is the problem now 4 5 ThisThe loop will
