nt does not give us power, but it is a valid statement. Let s talk about the second statement int x.After that, we have our terminator, then int y After solving this, let s see that int x and int y There is an error because the terminator has been removed, which means it is on the same line. If it is on the same line, then we have used one in the same line in which we are declaring it. So here the rule of type declaration has been broken and this is where our third problem comes. In the third problem, what did we have that it is in the same line and in the middle we have a comma, so it was valid but this is what happened to us in Valid statement is the fourth statement. We have defined a character inside it with the name stars. We have stored two stars inside it. We see whether it is valid or not. Inside our code we write care stars is equal to two stars. Star is save it. Now let us compile this statement. Once compiled, we have a warning generated.
