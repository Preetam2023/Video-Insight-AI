because we will store six numbers in it, after that the first six even numbers will be stored in it.If we want to store the values of numbers, then this will be our interesting code. First of all, we create an integer pointer in ptr ptr. If we are storing five variables in memory com equal to five integers, then we will write int star and then initialize it with call. We will first pass five, after that we will store the size of int in ptr of zero. We will store one in ptr ofv. We will store three andSimilarly t th and then and here we will be storing our odd numbers so here sen has come and here f has come now we can also print this for int aa 0 i 5i print f statement percentage d b a ptr of 0 and in fact ptr of i So these are the starting five odd numbers we have stored and then got them printed. Now what will we do, we will reallocate this memory to reallocate the memory.
