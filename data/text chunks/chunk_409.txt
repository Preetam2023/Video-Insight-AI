g about the same memory location, then our addresses would have been the same.Let s verify this too. With the help of code, first of all create a function with the name of void print address and take a variable n in it. Now what to do is store the value inside n inside the main function. We will call four more print addresses in which we will pass n. Let us also create this. Inside the print address print address, we have integer n coming and here we will print the value of integer n.If we are going to get it done, then the address of n is percentage Y B S A and here we will print the address of n and we will copy the same line and write here. Now when we will run this code, now open our terminal, compile and these warnings are coming because our pointer is printed with percentage p but we have typecast it in unsigned int, so do not take so much tension about warnings, now look carefully.
