o our s1. So here we passed the edge argument to s1 and inside this s1, our argument will be copied. The structures which are there are called by value, meaning the structure we have created here is not here, this s1 is another structure in which we haveA copy of the argument will be being made, so when we call print info, then two structures will be created inside the memory, both of which will be named s1, so let s save it and run it, now the complete information of the student has been printed to us, now call by value has been done, call by reference, let s check that also a little once, by changing the value of s1 i.e. its roll number, we do it here 1660Earlier it was 1664, now we have changed it to 1660 and now we get this roll number printed inside the main function. What happened after the function call? The roll number printed by the main function is 1664, the original one has not changed because the structures are passed by call by value.
