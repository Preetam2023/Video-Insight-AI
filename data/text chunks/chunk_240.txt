a by the way we can also solve the series in O of V also in a very simple way ok is the mathematics.By using the golden ratio, but I will tell you about it in the next lecture, it is very interesting and well, the next question is now friend, this is going to be a homework for you, I will not do it, this is homework, print first n phoneki numbers means you have to show this in the output, okay, the first, you have to show the output like this, if suppose you get n, 7, then you have to show like this, the first fobo key, okay, then the first fina key number, nunan number, not nunar, what did I write?Here the number is one, then you have to write the number of the second fina is one, then you have to write further two, then you have to write three, then you have to write fi, then you have to write eight, then show you 1 2 3 4 5 6, then you have to write 13, okay in the seventh, so you have to print it like this, you will do it yourself and this is going to be solved exactly like what we
