e making changes according to whatever input the user gives us. We are running our loop accordingly. Now the next question which we will talk about is, keep taking numbers as input from the user unless a number is a multiple of seven, that is, we have to keep taking input from the user until the user enters such a number.Which is a multiple of seven, which comes in the table of seven, so it is very simple, exactly as we have written the code, it is exactly the same, we just have to change the values a little, then we will keep entering the numbers, what about breaking the condition as soon as n is equal to 7. If it becomes equal to 0, this condition means that the number n is a multiple of 7. Similarly, we will break it, so let s run it. Compile Run. First of all, we are entering six, the code is running. Entered three, it is running in three. Entered 12, it is running in 12 also, but as soon as I enter 14, thank you will be printed. Why the code ends here because 14 is our sen s.
