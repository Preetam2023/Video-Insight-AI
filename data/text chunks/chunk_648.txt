ata with the help of file pointer. First of all, let s say, to read the data, we scan F and print F.Instead of F scanf and F print F, we use two functions, with these we can read different types of data, it can be string data, it can be character data, it can be integer data, it can also be float data, so in F scanf, like inside scanf, if we talk about scanf, what scanf used to do, first of all it used to take the format specified of the variable, then there were two parameters inside it, but inside our F scanf there are three parameters, out of whichFirst is our file pointer, second is our format specified of variable, so first of all we will tell which file.
