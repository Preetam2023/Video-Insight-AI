false is printed, then we will get zero on the screen, there are two other relations which we check.It is of greater than or greater than equal to two like if we write 3 greater than 4 it will return ro because if it is false then greater than 4 is not 4 but if we make 4 greater than 3 it will return we have true but if we make 4 greater than 4 it will return ro because forer is not greater than 4 but if 4 is greater than 4 then it will returnWell, there are some cases according to which we produce our output. Let s try them out in the code. If we wrote 4 greater than 3, it would appear in the output. But here, if we have written 3 greater than 4, then the output should now show zero i.e. false. If we have written 3 greater than 3, then zero will appear in the output because th is never greater than 3. But if we have made 3 greater than equal to 2, then it is greater.
