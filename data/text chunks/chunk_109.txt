of n, if I take 43, okay, I have created a box, which I have first initialized to two, then its value increases, that is, okay, write it like this.Give it to me brother where did it go yes here is that the value of a is first taken to curry and then up to see it will come from n to n 1 and I have created a box a in which for now I have rows stored okay in step by step what if my number is actually prime which I know is 43 prime then it will not hit this condition even once. This condition will not hit at all because the prime number will not be divisible from two ton 1 is never divisible, so this condition will never happen, there will never be a break, the value of a will never be one, because this thing will never run, the loop will keep going on again and again but it will never be hit, then we will come straight here and the value of a will remain zero of zero, then it will just be printed, then the number is prime, so in the case of 43, what happened is that if instead of 43, sup
