he sum of all the numbers from five to 50. We have to calculate it and get it printed on the screen. How to get it printed? Let s remove this part and take a variable int sum 0. This time the initial iteration will be from five and where will it end till the lesson becomes equal to 15 and at the end we will do i and here we will do sum sum i or its short hand is written i and at the endWe will print the percentage d i of the sum. Let s save it. Once we analyze the code a little, we initialized the sum with zero. We started our loop with five and ended it when the value of i becomes 50. Gradually we increased it one by one. First it was five, then it became six, then it became seven, then it became eight. Every time we will add the value of aa inside our sum, i.e. 5 6 7 8.Till we reach 50 and at the end we will print the value of our sum, save it and run it to see if we compile it, then the sum of all the numbers from 5 to 50 comes to us as 1 2 6 5.
