Clear care C print the character of one. To print the value of A, we do this work and do this again. Another thing we can do is if suppose I had written all this instead of all these things, if I had written that look care C is equal to two, already I have given A here. Okay, look at this care C, let s say I have printed it here. Control C is okay and then I write our int x is equal to two. I can also write like this.Int of C and then if I print myWe can use the entire thing in the loop which is given here because we have to print all the characters again and again and then it is going to be quite simple. Put this thing in the loop, look at it, remove it and remove this thing. In the simple loop, we have to print all the things and show them, so in this we do not even need to take any input from the user because we have to print all the alphabets, so write directly for int a 65, start from 65 only.Come, this is 90, it is okay, the value of our root is 90 and write it here.
