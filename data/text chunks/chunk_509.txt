that we will print it. Your full name is the percentage of full name. Now let s save it and run it. First of all, let usYou have to enter your full name, but here you will notice one thing that in your full name, only the first name is entered, that is, whatever is after the space, it is not input at all, so here we learn a special property that the scan which is F, cannot input multi word strings, that is, if you put more than one word inside a string, like you put this is a sentence, then it will be able to input only this word as soon as a space comes and the thing after that.If this part is not entered inside our string, then this is the drawback of scan f. Its weakness is that it cannot enter multi word strings which have multiple words because it will not be able to track the spaces. So here we will use two special functions, first of which is get s and then put s. So these come into our picture. Now gate s which is a little depreciated, so instead of this we will use f gates.
