iven to the compiler to do, it will be done. Now whatever is this else inside the if else condition.If is not compulsory then it is obviously compulsory. Else is our optional. Else is our wish. We want to get some more work done. If the condition fails or even if we don t want to get it done then we can remove the else completely. Now let s do some examples of this. First of all define a variable inside our code. Let s assume we have stored 19 in the else edge. Or better yet, let s take the input of the else from the user.First we print enter age and after that we will scan the age. Percentage D and age. From here we remove the assignment from the declaration. Now as soon as we have the age, first of all we will check. Now in age we know that the one whose age is above 18 is an adult. The one whose age is below 18 is not an adult. So we are going to write the same statement in the code here. If our age is greater than 18 in that case.We want to print adult .
