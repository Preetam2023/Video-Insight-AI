s , what will happen in the minus? The meaning of this statement is a a b, so a is 1, b is 4, 1 4 3. So in a, we should get 3 as printed. Let s tally it, if 3 is in the output, then in this wayWhenever we have to shorten the expression because we are using the same operands on the left and the right, then what we will do is we will write minus equal to two, we will write multiply equal to two, same for divide, same for module, these are our easiest operators, our assignment operators, so in this way, our basic operators were the basic instructions, we have completed them, now we will do some problems, after doing these problems, the things that we will learn now.We have read in Chapter Two and it will sit inside our mind. The first question is to write a program to check if a number is divisible by two or not. Now we have to write a program to check if a number is divisible by two or not. Suppose any number x is given to us, the value ofFor example, suppose 4 gets divided by 10.
