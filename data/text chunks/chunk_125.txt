say sorry include std d h int main function return zero, okay and let s try to write our code here. Let s say anything, I have to print it from the Y loop.Numbers from one to 10 or up to 100 are int, so I write them like this. See, I have already declared from to 100 in the while, now I will write while, okay, I will write Y, come lane equals 100 and I will directly print F. Okay, what is the percentage of your number? Come and here I write inside this increment statement of the code. So let s see what will happen in it. Look, all the numbers from one to 100 will be printed.So, it is somewhat similar to a for loop, but while loop has its advantages and disadvantages, the main advantage is that you do not know where it is starting from or what is happening, that is, when we go ahead with some examples, in the next lecture, I will be able to explain to you more easily why we are using while loop, but if you do not know things, you know less about things, then keep this thing in mind.
