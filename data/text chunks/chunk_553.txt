soon as i6 happens, our slice is finished and the final string which we will return will be in that.Aod inside our new string, one by one the value of j is increasing from row and the value of i is increasing from n and will go till m, so let us try to achieve this thing from this line and and in the last, what will we do in the new attr, we will append j, here we will append it here ba s 0, now we need this j here, so we declare j outside int j 0, so hereYou will not have to initialize it, let s save it. Now by putting S in the last, we will also print our new string. Inside the main function, we will create our character SDR, inside which we will write Hello World. Now we will call the slice, we will pass our string in it along with n 3 m 6. Let us save it and run. So there is a space here because in Hello World, we have given a space without any space.
