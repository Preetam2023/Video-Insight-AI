reverse inside the main function, then print the array, save it and run the return of this function.The type is also kept blank because the reverse would not be returning anything, so what is our reverse? 0 4321 Here we made a small mistake when we wrote the second value, we did not write it as n i 1, if we wrote n i i, then we write it as n i 1. If this mistake is not to be made, then there is no one, let s run it again. This time it is printed, our reverse is 5 4 3 2 1.Our array has been reversed. What did we create? 1 2 3 4 5 is printed. 54321 and how to reverse it. Looped through half the array. Interchanged the first value with the second value. Interchangeed the first value with the second. Now one thing we will notice in this is call by value or call by reference. The function that we called is call by reference. Why is one called an array?Whatever the array is, it is our pointer, so the call is made by reference from the pointer itself.
