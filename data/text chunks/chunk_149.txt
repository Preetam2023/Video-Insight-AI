printed and no error has come. So if we have a statement then we can work without curly braces also. But the good programmers bring consistency in the program and if we want to become a good programmer then we have to put curly braces every time. So I would have used curly braces every time.Because let s see an example, if you do not use curly braces and write multiple statements, then what will happen? We have written de can vote de can vote here, now let s save it, so here already an error has come that else is there, it should always come after an if , what did it do with this if , it merged this single one which is the beginning printed statement, but it did not count the second printed statement along with the if .
