okay so keep in mind whenever such things happen then infa loop type of type becomes our unless end.Till we have any break condition inside, okay let s move ahead friend, let s move to the next question, the next question has been given to us, predict the output, again in the main function we have written int x 4 y 0 z, then oneThen mine is bigger than row, of course, go inside and let s do one thing, we mark the block of weil also, this is the curly bracket and the other one here, so this is complete my block of weil, let s mark it once, okay, very good, okay brother, now it is written here, is one greater than zero, four, go ahead exactly, one minus minus one minus minus means if x is less than one, then the value of x becomes three, go ahead.Increase this print is not being printed, so it would not have made any difference if this had also been written in its place because it is not being used anywhere. Right now only one is written. Okay, y Ps Pw is increased by two.
