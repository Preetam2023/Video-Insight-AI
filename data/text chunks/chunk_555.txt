to put a for loop, inside it you will have to copy things like this and then you can get it printed.Or we can get it returned. The logic will remain the same. Our programming language may change. The next question we will talk about is to write a function to count the occurrences of vowels in a string i.e. how many times the vowels are there. Others are adding that in a string, we have to count, as if we are given a string, how many times do vowels occur in Hello World, Hello World? One, Two, Three. Now, for those students who do not know what vowels are, there are vowels in our letters A, E, I, O and U. There are five vowels in the English language. If any of these five appears, then we will count plus plus. We have already discussed how to do this for loop.How to apply it and for how long, till the null character appears and we will analyze the characters one by one. If the verbal character appears then do plus plus. If it does not appear then leave it and move ahead.
