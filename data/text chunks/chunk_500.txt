acters of our string printed and will do this work until our character becomes a null character i.e. we will create a C pointer or an I and what will this eye object or eye object do, it will traverse it by putting a loop and likeThe value of s becomes back s i.e. null character, similarly the loop will end and we will not get the null character printed and at the end we will have got our entire string printed. Let s visualize it once with the help of the code and let s see how it will happen. First of all, let s create two variables. First our first name will store its value in it. Then we will create our last name. We will also store our value in it. Now what will we do? Let s create a separate function.Void print to print strings Null String Now, how to pass this string to the function, pass it like a normal character array.
