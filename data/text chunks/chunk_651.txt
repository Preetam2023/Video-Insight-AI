have read, the character is equal to percentage C and we will print this character C and at the end.What we will do is close our file by F PTR, save it and run it once, nothing is printed here, something is not printed because we have opened a new test, we have to open the test and here we say clear compile , then after running it, we still have the value of the character not printed because we have it opened, it is still in write mode, we will have to open it in read mode, compile it once again.Let s compile and run and then we have got our character e equal to a . What it did is, we get it scanned and store it inside the same variable, like we have already printed the value of s , now again we read the next character in s itself and get it printed here and we will do this same thing again and again five times because we have to read the entire l , let s save it and run it too, so pay attention here.
