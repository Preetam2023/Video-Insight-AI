ove ahead and solve the next question, my next question is also giving the exact output, while here. The question of loop is while character A is lesson character B print F here it is written bak sl n Malayalam is a palindrome Palindrome means look M then A then L and palindrome is not there Mala alam it is the spelling is wrong these people have written it right it happens Mala farya lam is ok this is the spelling anyway there can be a technical error anyway a text is printed hereIt is written that while A is less than B, then according to you, what will this code do, according to me, this code was an infinito that if the S value of a character is 97, if A s is equal to B, then how much will be one more than B s, 98, so here it is written while 97 is 98, so it will always remain small, even if there is no change inside these variables, it will keep on getting printed, okay, so it will give us an info loop, meaning here it will be printed back slash and then what do you say?The output
