help of Put C, save it and run it. So now look at the test file, Mango has come for us instead of L. So if you want to do it for the character, then you can also scan F for the character.Or we can also do F get C, but if we have other data types like string, integer, float, etc. then for all of them we know that we have to use F scanf or F print F. Next let s talk about EOF. EOF is a special thing which is also called end of file. Now this EOF exists in different languages. EOF of C is capital EOF. It is also small in Java.If EOF occurs then EOF is the end of file. When we read characters from F gate C, then as soon as inside our file By reading characters one by one, all our characters are exhausted, then our F get C returns EOF and returning EOF means EOF is like NULL. If NULL was returned, we knew that the file does not exist. Similarly, when EOF returns, we come to know that we have reached the end of our file, which means we have traversed all the data and read it.
