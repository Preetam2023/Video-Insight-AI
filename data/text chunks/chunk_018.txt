ore it in one of the boxes and we will give a name to that box, which is the name here.Location i.e. we will store it on a new box, we will name that memory location b and what will this b be called, this will be called our variable, so if we store anything inside the memory, then when we give a name to that memory location, we give a name to that box, we call it a variable. Now how to actually implement the variable, let s see by writing its code. We will be removing this line which is the entire code.This is our by default code, that is, we are going to write this every time, now we do not pay attention to it, now we have to pay attention to some parts in the middle, suppose we want to store the number 25, then we will write here int number is equal to 25, so because of this single line, our number 25 is stored in my, go inside that box and we have taken the name of that box here, number, similarly if we want to store any character, care star e.
