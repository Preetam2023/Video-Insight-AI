ry address of another variable, so I hope that we have understood the basic thing, now the variable.That stores the memory address of another variable is a pointer. Now there is a syntax to write points. We cannot write points like a normal variable because we have to tell the compiler in advance that the variable we are writing does not store a normal value. It stores the value of a memory address. Which is a special value, so the syntax to write it is normal.We write the variable int as equal to 22. Whenever we create a pointer, we put an asterisk along with int, we put a star, then we write the name of our pointer variable, then we write is equal to end s symbol and edge, that is, this pointer is a variable which is storing the address of this edge. Here we learned two new things, one is this star, this is the star which is this.We call it value at address operator, value at address operator and this M percentage is what we call address of operator.
