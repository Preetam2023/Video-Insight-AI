e will write the name of our property which we want to access, similarly I0 roll number and I0 CGPA.Now let s actually create an array of students and remove the old code, then we have already created Structure Student. Here we write Structure Student. Now we are going to give the name of the array as EC. We have 100 children inside EC, so if we have to store the roll number of the second child of EC, then we will write it as 1664. If we have to store the CGPA of this child of EC, then we will write it as CGPA.99.2 And if we want to store the name of this child, then again we will write ATR CPY first, 0 name and then we will write our name. Now we can print this information also, first we will write name percentage S in the form of print F. Now we only print the name. If you are writing the code for the first time, then you have to print all three. Dot name and run it once. So the name has been printed here.
