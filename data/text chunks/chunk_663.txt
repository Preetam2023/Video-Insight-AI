our test file. 1 2 3 4 and 5. Let s save it. Now let s make a program. In fact, this is the program.What will we do, we will create a file pointer from the beginning, we have taken it, now we will open the file, then f ptr e f open, first of all we will pass the name of the file f is test dty, after that we will pass our mode, we have to read, now we will create an integer variable n in which we are going to read the numbers f scanf percentage d, before that f ptr and store the number in n, after that we will print that number on the screen number e is equal to percentage d and thisSame thing repeat for number five If you want to do this then we save this entire code and in the end we do not forget to close our file and write inside it F PTR Save and Run. This has generated some error for us because here we had to put the address of n. We will pass it in our F scanf. Save and now run. So the numbers are read one by one.
