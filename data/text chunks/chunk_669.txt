end and we are opening it in write mode.Even if it does not exist, it will be created automatically. Now we read it from the user. Integer and print enter a scanf percentage d and n. After this we run the loop int aa 0 aa until lesson is equal to n. In fact start aa from one to n. Now to check the odd, we have to write if aa modelo 2 is not equal to 0 when i divided by 2. Cry in reminder.Will not give meaning if our number is odd then the number is odd so now we have to write it in the file. How will we write it in the file? With the help of F print F we will print F. The first parameter will be pass our file pointer inside which we have to write. After that we will pass the type format specified and will separate these numbers with a tab space. We will get them printed in the next line. Let s save it and finally we have closed the file.Let s run it. Suppose we want the first 10 odd numbers, then automatic odds.All the numbers which are odd till tx1 are printed for us 1 3 5 7 and 9.
