fter some space, so it will look good in this way and in the last, let s print the next line from B. Now inside the main function, we create an array in which there are some numbers 1 2 3 4 5 and 6s and let s print the numbers. Inside the call print numbers, we wrote the array as A as the first argument and wrote the number as six.There are elements inside it, we save it and run it, then our numbers written one after the other have been printed to us and here if we wanted, we could have made it a pointer by removing the square brackets, start PTR and here instead of int star PTR or infact PTR, if we keep it as AR, we run the code again and this time the same output has come to us, which means you can point to the array.If you want to keep it in your function parameters or you can keep the notation with square brackets, we will get the same output in both the notations. The next topic which we will discuss is Multi Dimension Arrays.
