e second type is our explicit explicit conversion. We as a programmer and as a user do it ourselves. Our compiler does not give it to us. This is the conversion which we want to do ourselves. This is an external conversion so it is implicit.Conversion says that the small types like type like int can be stored in float, type like int can be stored in double but float or double cannot be stored inside int, that is why automatic will not convert it, but if we want to convert it ourselves as a programmer as a coder, then we write the value here in this manner. We put two parentheses between the two and write the type in which we want to convert.If you don t want then what will the compiler do? It will forcefully convert. The compiler doesn t want to convert the big type into small but it will have to do it because we have written int.
