han one and this number, then it is prime, it is simple, no number is different from itself and one.If it is not divisible by any other number, then what is our number? If it is a prime number, then we will keep checking by dividing. All the numbers are within the same range. Suppose our number is 25. So what is our working rule here? Let me show you, if I show you the steps, what will we do? We will divide all the numbers from two to 24, that is, we will divide 25. We will not look at dividing all these numbers by one, off course.25 is divisible by one, if I write 25 model 1 then its value will come to us because it is divisible but is 25 divisible by two otherwise what will I do from two to whatever is my number if n is then n 1 if it is 25 then what will I do till 24 I will divide my number like I will check Reminder is 25 divisible by two so how to check it you allYou know, if you see this row has come, that means it is divisible by two, then it has become composite, but we know th
