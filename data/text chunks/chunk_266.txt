also a function whose return type is int because int.value return It does not return int value i.e. it returns zero, after that its name is main but main is a keyword, the rest are the names of all the functions which we will create and all will not be keywords, after this comes the parentheses, this is our curly braces and inside this is all its block of code. So in this way, just like the main function, we are going to create other functions which will be working as per our wish. First of all, a function for an example.If we write it, we have the boiler plate code in which we already have the header file above, below is the int main, return zero, we are creating our print hello function, at the top we will tell the compiler that we have created the function, how to tell void print hello, after that we will be actually creating our print hello.
