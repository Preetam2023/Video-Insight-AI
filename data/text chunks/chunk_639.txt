ings are going on internally at the buffer level which for now we will not go into that much detail. Basically our system should know what is our intention to open any file so that it can make our work a little easier. If we tell in advance that we have to write, then it will make the work easier and will make it easier to read. So, from this perspective, we would have accepted it.Now here we have assigned it to the file pointer. Have we opened our file by passing two parameters in it and finally assigned its value in F.PTR, that is, what this F.Open would have done is that it would have returned a pointer to the file which we would have stored in F.PTR. So this is the statement to open the file. Now to open the file, it is necessary to have the file first, so we create a file, inside our same folder we will go here.This icon will be created from a new file.The first parameter inside txt.gz f open is the name of the file i.e. test d txt.gz.
