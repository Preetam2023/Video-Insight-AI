come file.How is it performed inside the computer? So first of all let s talk about what a file is. There is a container inside the file memory in a storage device to store data. Here our store device will be our hard disk. So there are different containers inside the hard disk. We can also call them chunk of memory. A lot of data will be stored inside each chunk of memory and we file the same data. Just like in schools, we will have some files stored in colleges which will be with our teachers.Some of our personal data will be stored in those files which will be with our admin department. Suppose I have a file whose name is Shraddha Khapar. I may have a classmate whose file may be in her name. In this way, just like there are files in real life, similarly there are different files inside the computer system. In fact, if we have ever used a computer before, we must have seen some or the other file inside our system. Now whenever we talk about files, we always have to remember this.
