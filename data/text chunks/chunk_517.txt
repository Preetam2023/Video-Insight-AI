ll always be Hello World inside it. Let us define the initialism first. So we will make it a string. So, we will make it as Hello World according to the character pointer. We will put Hello World in it. Now we get it printed, we write here with Can Change and after that, we change this string also. So as soon as we change the string, let s assume that we have made it Hello , after that we push it again, Can Change and save it.Let s run it, so first of all our string was Hello World. What did this line do? It printed Hello World. Then we changed it to Hello, so what did it do? Then it printed Hello because the value of points can change. Now let us create another string. If the character cannot change then we can define it in this way. We will put Hello World in it too. By putting Hello World, we can test it.
