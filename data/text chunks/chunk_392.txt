centage D number is just a number. We made a number, got the square printed of the number and again.After getting the number printed, let s run it once and analyze the output. Then we got 16 in the square and the value of the number was four, but if we look carefully, inside the square function, we had changed the end. This number has been sent here. So, we had changed its value to 4 by 4 i.e. 16. So when our n went back, it should have become 16, so why is it four?Now we have already discussed this, this is four because whenever we pass a value, by default inside C, it is passed by value, which means copies are made. We had discussed this concept in the functions that this number is an argument. When we pass it inside a function, then what will the formal parameter do, that is, the parameter will make a copy of this argument and all the changes that happen inside this function.
