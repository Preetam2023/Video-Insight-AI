gh, so in this way. We can also scan f from percentage s and print f. Let s see the example of both. What we will do inside our main function is that we will create a string called character name and give some maximum size of this string, let s say 50. Now first of all we will take this name as input from scanf, then we will output this name from print f. Scan f percentage a and then the name and after that we will print f percentage a. Your name is and here we will write the name, now just this.The entire print string function comes in a single line with the help of print F. When we specify the format with percentage s in it, we save it and run it again. So now first of all we have to enter our name, so we entered the name and now the entire string that has come for us, your name is appended and here is our string. Inside our output, percentage s is to be used always whenever we scan the string. F andWe have to do input and output with the help of print F.
