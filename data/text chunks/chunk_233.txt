loop inside which we are printing the numbers from one to five. for int i 1 i less equt 5 a p plus. Now in this we will print the percentage d b s a a. Now here if we write the condition in the middle if a i is equal to i equal to 3 i.e. as soon as a becomes three, this is the work of the if condition that it is checking as soon asOnce i3 is done, from here we do a break, that is, we come out of this entire loop and finally we get it printed and save it and run it once and analyze the output. We have one printed as 2 and end how it got printed. Earlier we had the value of i as one. As soon as the value of i was one, we went inside the loop. Is the value of i three or not? If it is not three then it will not be true. We have printed one and let it be i.
