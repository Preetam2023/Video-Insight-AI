umber is required, i p p, okay, what are the steps we had to do here, look back, what are the steps.What we had to do here is, first of all, put it inside the sum, how much p a p b, sorry, just put a p b, here it is okay, put a b inside the even, then put the value of b inside a and the value of b, put the even value inside b. Please do not change the order of these two. Look here, like I first did a b, then b even. If instead of this, I first do what is called b even and then do a b, then there is no meaning left in them because.The value of sum has been inserted in b. Suppose there is some s value in b, then the same value will come in a again later. So this order is very important. Okay, in a we have inserted the value of b. Inside b, we have inserted the value of sum. At the end, we do one thing. We print and check our sum. Then print and check our sum. Okay. Percentage D. Percentage D. For once, I am writing the sum like this only. Let s see what is ours.
