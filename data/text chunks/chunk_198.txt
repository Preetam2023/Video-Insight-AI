ur two cases? Either our n will be even or our n will be odd. Well, if n is even then our n is even. So in that case, suppose we have to print the numbers from one to 6. Then divide them into groups 1 2 3 4 and 5 6. Well, if six is the number then it will be divided into three groups. Two is the basis of two. It is a simple thing, the number is divided into half of the number and so on.You know the answer 1 2 is 1, 3 4 is also 1, 5 6 is also 1, so tell me one thing, how many times is this three times, that is, whatever number is my n byte times, if I add 1, then what will be my direct answer, friend n ba 2, so anytime, if my n is even, then I can directly print my answer n2, so let s see, friend.How will we solve the sum of our series by method number two? If it is okay then let s take the same question here. Our two different formulas are based on different cases. Look at what I mean. Let me try to explain something to you.
