way we have total 11 numbers printed. Now this i i 1 is right.There is a short hand to write it i.e. we can also write it i p, like we had learned that if we have to write i i 1, then we can write it as i e 1. We had learned this short hand while doing assignment operators. Now for i 1, we can also write i p, then it becomes the short hand of the short hand and this is only for va, that is, if there was a two here and there was a two here, then for that iPs ps plus we cannot do i p plus means add one to i every time. In the same way there is also a plus p aa. Plus p aa p p aa has a different meaning. Apart from that there is also minus minus aa and i is also minus minus. Now let us discuss this plus plus and minus minus thing in a little detail. We call them increment and decrement operators. First of all.Let s do increment of our increment operator which means to increase something i.e. to increase in English. So there are two types of increment operators.
