ed always whenever we scan the string. F andWe have to do input and output with the help of print F. Now one special thing in this, you can ask that when we entered the name Shraddha, here when scanf took a name, we did not put ba s 0 in it, then how come back s 0 did it take the string. Now here we can ask one thing that Didi, when we entered our name, we did not put ba s 0 in it, then how did C know that it is a string, so what does C do automatically whenever you put percentage s?Whatever you enter, after that it will automatically insert back 0 i.e. null character. It will seem automatic, so we do not need to take tension. We just have to input our characters. Next thing we will do is solve a practice question. There are two parts in this. From the second part we will be released some new things. So first of all let s start with the first part. Ask the user to enter their first name and print it back to them. This is very much.This is easy, we have already done it.
