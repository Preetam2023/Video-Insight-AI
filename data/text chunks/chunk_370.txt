ted a variable which has 22 inside it and have stored the address of that variable inside a pointer. Now we will get things printed one by one. First of all, we are learning the printing of the address, how to print the address, then we will write percentage p, after that we will write m percent as, let s save it and let s do one.Once run, this is some value that has come to us. Here, we also put a basilisk. This is the value, this is the value of the address of the edge. This is the format, it is called hexadecimal format. Now it is possible that when you print in the machine, you get some other different value, then there is no problem in that. Memory addresses are different according to different systems, so your address and my address can be completely different.There is no problem in it for variables, but the format is a little difficult to read, so what can we do? We can convert our entire address from hexadecimal to unsigned int.
