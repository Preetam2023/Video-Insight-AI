nt anything. Suppose we are getting it printed. Apart from this, my name is Shata and the next line. So now we have two lines inside this function. Now we call it again, we will see that the same thing has been printed three times for us, but the function call has remained the same, that is, if we have to make any change, like what the volume button used to do earlier, volume button one will do it.By increasing it, it used to change from two to three, but we want the volume button in our remote, which is one to become three, from three to five, to skip two or two, then now we do not need to change it on the call. Now we will go into the complete definition and change it so that the user does not have to make any difference. If he just has to press the button like before, then this is also an advantage of writing the functions. Now let us solve some questions in which we can describe different functions.You must be looking at their properties by writing.
