character array in which if we add a null character in the last, then it will show that it is A.B.C.They are not different, they are joining together to form a word, so this means adding the null character at the end. So what does the string show? The string shows us that it is representing a word. Character Array Now let s look at some of its examples, we have a character array whose name is Name. Now inside the name, we have stored a lot of characters, but at the end, we have also stored null from 0 to 10, so this isIn a way, it represents that the name is not a combination of different characters. The name forms a complete word and the name actually points towards this value. After that, if we look at the class, then the class is not separate. The class forms a complete word by adding all these characters and that word looks like this. Whenever we write strings, we ignore this null character in a way, but at the time of declaring, we use this null character.
