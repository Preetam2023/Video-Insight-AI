string of i is not equal to null.character and now let s do i p then we will compare every time i.e. we will write the condition if at of i is equal to equal to another and or string of i is equal to our e, after that we will write string of i is equal to equal to a and and string of a is equal to o equal to o and and string of a is equal to equal to y So have we checked whether our rectangle is index p which is the string of ourThere is a character inside the string, whether it is A or E or I or O or U, that is, if there are any of the vowels, then at that time we will do count plus plus and what to do at the end, we will return the count.
