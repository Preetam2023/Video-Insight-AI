t by 10 also, so we will keep r by multiplying it by 10. Okay, then we will divide our n also by 10. And according to me, if I repeat this thing, this particular process, I will repeat it, that is, in a loop.So our work should be done because we have seen that it will be done. Okay friend, let s check. Let s see if there are any problems in this code or no problems. First of all, let s solve this code and our condition is going to be this. We will do this till my n becomes equal to zero, then the condition is going to be that our n should be greater than zero or else we will write.We can do n is not equal to 0. Okay, so this time let s make n greater than 0 and create our code. Write the reverse number DC here and paste the same code here too. First of all, we have taken a number, taken input, everything is done. Now instead of int sum, we write int reverse. It will be reversed by r.
