the address stored on the pointer, in this we will be learning about the value at address operator. Now first of all, if we have to print the value of edge, then we already know that we need to do percentage d because edge is of integer type.If it holds the value then we will write Percentage D. This is the most normal but if we have to print the point value at pointer then we will put star in front of it. This asterisk means value at address, so whatever address is inside the pointer, whatever value is above that address, it will be printed. So we know that our address inside the pointer is 1020 and stored above 1020.
