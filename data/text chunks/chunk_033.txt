n fixed meaning, it cannot be changed. Similarly, every programming language has its own dictionary. C also has its own dictionary in which some words are reserved, that is, they are fixed, their meaning will remain only the same, we cannot use it as a variable name.Neither should it be done in the same way. There are some reserved words inside C which have some special meaning and this meaning is known to the compiler. So there are 32 keywords inside C programming language and we have to pay special attention to these keywords. If we talk about the list of these 32, then our 32 keywords are something like this. In C, in this list, we must be seeing that int is our reserved word, our keyword is of C, so it means any.We cannot name the variable as int. Similarly, if we go to search for it, float is also one of our keywords. Apart from this, character is also one of our keywords and these are all the keywords.
