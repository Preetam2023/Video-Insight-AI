variable. We will talk about it in the functions which will be our next lecture or the next lecture. I will talk about it in a little more detail after the loops, but let me tell you in brief right now. I will tell you the meaning of scope is that for or if inside the if statement, let s say I have used someI have written an if statement and inside it, I am creating a variable there. Inside the if block, the power of the variable or the limitation of the variable, the power of the variable, is limited within itself. Okay, like if we do anything inside this main function, then it is limited within it. It has no value outside here. Similarly, the value of our i is not outside this for loop, okay, but.
