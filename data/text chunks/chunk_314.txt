unt times had to be printed n times here.It can happen five times here, it can happen even 10 times. Now once it is printed, then the count is left to get the number of times printed and if ever these counts would have been 1 1 1, the value of this count would have been if it becomes zero after that, then there is no need to print anything, otherwise we will just write return here, we will notice here only return is written, return is going from zero to zero after return, if nothing is written then there is no return, hence return type.So this is our example of recursion, we also call it cursive function. If you are not able to understand it at all, then there is no problem at all. Just to confuse it, recursion is being told in this way first so that it can apply a little bit of magic. What will we do here, we will call print hello world and the count will pass five because we have to print it five times. We save this code and run it in the terminal, so hello world will come to us.
