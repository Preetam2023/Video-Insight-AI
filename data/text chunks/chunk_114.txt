only we will go out for a walk. If any one of the two things becomes true then we will have to work. If both are true then we have to do one of the two.True, even then we have to do it, then there are some such real life cases, which we want to put in the code, then our logical operators come in handy. The first logical operator is the end operator, we also call it end, inside it, we put two ends. If you look carefully, then single end on m. If we write, then it is a bitwise operator, which we should not write here, two ends, we will always write it, then it will be a logical operator. How can we use it, like suppose weFirst statement we write 4 E 3 What will this give us This will give us one i.e. true and we write the second statement 5 is gray The 2 This statement will also give us one i.e.
