enter number five then it is coming my prime. Of course everything will work okay so we look at one.We have also seen the condition here, if the number is smaller than one then we will not take the input, okay we will not take zero, even zero is nothing, in such a situation, let us see the condition of two, it is automatically covered because it could never be hit by chance, but for that also we can make it separately. Even if n is 2, what is that, our nether prime nor composite situation will come, okay, so I hope you will get the code of this prime number.I have slowly explained a little bit so that you can understand it well. Okay, let s move towards the next question. From here, you must have understood the meaning of break statement. When the loop has to be broken, it does not have to be run again and again unnecessarily. Okay, let s move ahead and come to the continue statement. Again, if our break looks like this, then the continue statement is just a little bit of it.
