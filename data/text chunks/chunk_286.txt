void here, this time we wrote int here like int is written in front of main because it returns zero. We also have to write the type of our return value here, so we have written it this time as int. After that, the name of our function andwrite your parameters inside So, what are our parameters, what are the values required? To calculate the sum, first of all we need integer value a. We need our first number, after that we need integer value b. Now what do we do if we write the definition of the function, then again int sum int a int b. What is the sum value a b? So what will we be returning? We use the keyword return to return any value.After whom does it go to the calling function, here we will call this same function from the main function but suppose we call this same function from some other function, then the return value goes to that other function and does not go to the main, so wherever the call is made, if the return value comes back to the same place, then we will return a b.
