he top, we will write our function factorial in which we have to find the factorial of any number n. Now the definition of the function will be int factorial, inside which we will pass the parameter n. Before calculating the factorial of n, let us calculate the factorial of n 1. We believe that this function will calculate and give the factorial of n 1, then we will write int factorial of.n 1 Factorial n 1 Now int factorial of n will be factorial of n 1 Multiply by n and return the factorial of n and the base case. What will happen here, when will we stop? We will stop when the value of our n becomes one. As soon as the value of n becomes one, we will return one. Or in fact, here we can stop at row also. If there is a return of zero, then in that case we will return one, so let s save it. Now here we will write factorial is five, take out the factorial of the new terminal, compile and run, then five.We have got the factorial of 120 printed.
