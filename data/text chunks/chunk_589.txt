pe. If we have declared a variable of structure type s1 then how will we declare the pointer for it. To declare the pointer, first of all we have to write the type like we write int star ptr and above we wrote int a and then we write ptr m but a the same format will remain only here pe instead of int.Structure Student will come, then inside our star PTR and PTR, we will assign it on m i.e. the address of s1, so all the format has to be kept the same, just int float care in the data type, in its place we have to keep the data type Structure Student so that we can tell that this is a pointer to the structure, let s check this also once, we have created a pointer to the student s1 above, we will create a pointer for it, Structure Student Star PTR and this PTR.Inside we assign the address of s1. Now if we want to print this same roll number then how will we get the same roll number printed? First we had written s1 roll.
