hen it will increase and later the value of i will be used, we comment it out once and save and end.Now after running and looking at the output, first of all two was printed and second time also two was printed. Why because initially the value of i was one. What Plus Plus did was to first increase it to two, after that we got i printed i.e. two got printed. So at the second time when we are getting the value of i printed, it has already become two, that is why two got printed there also, so what happens is plus p aa, we call it pre increment operator and i p.We call it post increment operator so plus pi means pre increment i.e. first incremented and later used and post increment i.e. first used and later increased so in this way we can write short hand for p and 1. Now in the same way we have decrement operators. What does decrement operator do? It decreases the value i.e. here if we have minus minus then we call it pre.
