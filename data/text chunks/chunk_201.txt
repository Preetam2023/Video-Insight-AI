mple thing. You must have understood then directly I can write if n is even then the answer is this.Think, when there was a question of for loop, friend, all the things had to be done by putting a loop in it, the loop was run that many times, now the direct answer will come in one stroke, there will be no need for rounds in one turn, there will be no need for iteration, we call it a very efficient code, we are fine with it because if our number becomes very big, then it is very simple for that, suppose their value is 1 lakh, if it is fine, then running the loop one lakh times is better than direct.The answer will come in a second, isn t there a difference between the two? Now here friend, this is only for even number of terms. If I say for odd number of terms, then a difference will come like suppose if n is odd then it is ok or we can write it as if n and 2 is not equal to 0, basically this will also come in the condition of our else.
