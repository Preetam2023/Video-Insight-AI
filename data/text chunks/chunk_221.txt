Dry run it once yourself. This is your homework to know how this code is running. After all, it s okay. How is this code running? I didn t do much, that s it, here I am.Made some changes because our code was changing again and again. Let s move ahead quickly, let s solve the next question. This is an even more dangerous question. For now, I am giving it a double star. This is one of the best questions that we are doing till now. Which one is print the number of the eighth fina?
