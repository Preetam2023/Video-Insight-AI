rint the sum of all the numbers from one to five. If three has been given, then the same is 1 2 3 6. So how to do this, first of all, we know the most basic thing that the user will scan F.Take the input of our n, after that as soon as n input comes, after that we have to run a loop for loop. Suppose we run in which the value of aa starts with one and goes till our four or up to n and in that we will do i plus plus. Now what is our work, the work is to write the work inside the loop. The work is to calculate our sum. So we will create a variable sum and initialize the value of this sum with row, that is, in the beginning the sum is our row and add inside this sum.If i 1 then one is added to the sum. If i 2 then 2 is added to the sum. If i 3 then 3 is added to the sum. So by doing this we will get the sum of all the values inside the sum like the value of i is one in the beginning.After updating, we have the value of to sum.
