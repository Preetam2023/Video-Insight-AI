tion inside the write mode is that you want to write something inside the file and write binary i.e. you want to write something in binary format inside your file. Now here also a special thing comes here whenever you go to write the file na and a. Suppose you have reloaded the file again.If you try to open and write the things in it, hello dot does not exist, then both these functions i.e. write and write binary will create that file. If it does not exist, you have not created the file but you want to write, then let us create it for you. This type of system exists and if the file already exists, suppose you have a file in which you have stored some data and you want to write it in write or write binary format.If you open it in these modes, then first your file will be opened, then the data inside it will be deleted and after that, the data that needs to be written will be written, then the data of your entire file gets overwritten.
