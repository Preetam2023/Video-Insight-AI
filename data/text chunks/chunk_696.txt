e written PTR of 0, we have written one PTR of 1, we have written 2 and PTR of 3, we have written t. Now in the middle of the code, if we want to increase two more sizes, then what will we do, simply PTR is equal to reallocate, inside this we will first pass PTR andAfter that, we are going to have our new size, the new size is 8, so the memory which could hold the first five numbers, can now hold eight numbers. In fact, for this we write the code that these are the numbers, we will make the user enter all these, we will print F, enter numbers, how many numbers to enter, in the beginning, to enter five numbers, we make a loop from i to five, from zero to five and scan our numbers in each one, percentage, d andPTR of I Now as soon as this memory becomes eight, then after that we will have to scan again for the numbers and now we have to enter eight numbers and once entered, now we will print these numbers, so for that also we write a loop, we will use the same loop again, print F to the
