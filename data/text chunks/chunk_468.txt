on is for the given.Array what will be the following, so first of all we have to extract this value. For this array, let s visualize this array once. There will be some structure inside the memory, inside which we will have five values stored and there will be a pointer A arr which is pointing to the zeroth index here. We first extract arr2, so its value will be this is ar01 and this is aa 2, so its value will be what we have.Thr because here we are using value at address operator so it will print us three and then next we do ar5 so this is ar3 this is AR 4 ar5 will not exist in this array because it is only a five size array so there will be memory on some but it is not a part of our array so here we will get an error. Let s verify it by coding it once. Let s make an array of only five size.
