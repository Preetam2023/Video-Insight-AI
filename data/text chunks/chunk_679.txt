how many bytes of memory does this data type take for me, then it will return this size of function.So once we see the size of int, first of all, how does it work? If I want to print the percentage, size of int and along with it, size of float and size of character, once I save it and run it, we have to ignore the warnings. Yes, so the size of int has come to us in four bytes, the size of float has also come in four bytes and the size of character has come in one byte. So this is the size of operator with the help of which we can print any data type.You can bring the size to yourself, so here what we have done is that inside the mallac, we have multiplied five by the size of the integer. Now what is the size of the integer. The size of the integer is four, so what will it do, it will bring 20 bytes of memory and give it to us. If suppose you want to take 14 bytes of memory, then what will happen for you, 14 bytes will be reserved.
