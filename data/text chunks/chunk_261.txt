k can be done as many times as we want. The second property is that it increases code reuse ability. If we see in our code, this is the rule of thumb that I do that if within the code, the same thing has to be done three times, more than three times, then make it a function. Suppose we have to print Hello World. If we have to print Hello World three times or more than that, then what to do.If we make a function of it, then whenever we call the function, that thing will be happening automatically, that is why instead of writing a big code again and again, what we can do is simplify it into a small function, due to which the reusability of the code increases. Now how do we actually write the function in C? There are some syntaxes of the function. The process of writing the function is usually a three step in normal cases.The process takes place, the first of which is the syntax of the function prototype.
