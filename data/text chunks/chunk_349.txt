ight and stored it in this variable. Now we will make another call to get fina of n 2 as fia of n 2. So now we called for n might and stored it in this variable and finally by adding both of them we got fina of n. Now we print this fina of n and will write fina of n here.First percentage D is again percentage D. First of all we will write the value of n i.e. n, after that we will write the value of our fina of n and we will return the value of our fina of n. With this function, this is our recurse function and every recurse function is incomplete without the base case i.e. it is wrong. Now what will be the base case in this? We have FOB of row and fina of one defined, so if the value of n ever becomes zero.Or if the value of n becomes one in some case, then there we will know what will happen for n 0. If n 0, in that case then we have to return zero and if the value of our n is one then in that case we have to return no.
