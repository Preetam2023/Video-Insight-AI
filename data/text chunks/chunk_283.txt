ated. Earlier we had written print hello or print goodbye. These are all our user defined functions. Next let s talk about passing arguments. Now what do functions do? In the beginning when we talked about the definition, what was the property of the function that they can take any value and they can give any value, then the value whichThe function takes are called parameters and the value that the function returns is called return value. So the function takes our parameter and gives us back a return value. Whenever we pass an argument, whatever values we give to our function are called arguments. So we can write our functions in three ways. One way is as we have been writing before, that is, void will be written here, void means our function does not return anything.What remains is the name of our function. Then here we have written the parenthesis of our statement terminator. This is a normal type of function which we have already talked about.
