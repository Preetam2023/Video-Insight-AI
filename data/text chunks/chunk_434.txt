s in our college exams in which they are asked how much memory will be reserved, we have to tell it.The calculation is done in such a way that whatever our data type will reserve a single memory, multiply the amount of space reserved inside the memory by how much we have to store, that way, our total memory consumed, total memory reserved will come to us. Once we initialize an array inside the memory, then like here we have created a price. Instead of entering the value of this price directly, if we remove the initialization size, then this syntax would also be absolutely correct.Also fits your use case, you have to use the same syntax to initialize any array. Now the next topic we will talk about is pointer array in array. By array array we understood that in which we play with plus minus multiply divide module. Here we are talking about pointers because arrays are related to pointers in some way or the other.
