is the underscore edge which is a separate variable. We make points according to this Int Star PTR. First we will print the difference Percentage Y B N PTR PTR and after that we will print the comparison. What do we do for comparison?Underscore PTR is there and we store the address of the edge in it. So now we will compare here whether both are same. How will we compare? Now the pointer which is normal PTR is storing the address of the edge and in Underscore PTR also the address of the edge is stored, so logically both of them have the same address value, so I is equal to I, then both of them will be equal to each other.Whatever the comparison is, it will return true, that is, if it returns one, then let s see the output. Save it once and run it. The difference is one and the comparison is also one. Now in comparison, one means true and in difference, one means by one integer. Like let s print their values too, percentage u, percentage u and here we will print PTR and under PTR.
