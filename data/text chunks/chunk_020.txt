ontainer where it is stored, so we can call themNow there are some rules for writing variables in C. The first rule of these is ours. What is meant by saying that variable R is case sensitive? What is meant by saying case sensitive is that small a and big a will be different, which is our capital a and our small a, these will be different, we cannot consider them the same, like if we have to store a number as 30, then we can write int a 30, then 30 is stored inside the memory and we have given a as the name of the location where it is stored. Now we have to store another number, 40.If we write int a 40 then we get 40 stored at the second location and we named that location as capital a. Here this letter a and this capital a are two different variables and are not the same. The second rule that says about the variable in c says that the first character is alphabet and underscore.
