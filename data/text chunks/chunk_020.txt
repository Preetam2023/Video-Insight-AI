s it became five, then it got updated again after removing the line. Now the value of aa became six. Now the value of aa became six. As soon as six became six, is mine five or smaller than five? Otherwise, our loop is over. Tata went bye, so that s all that was printed. One more enter was required, but it will appear that this is all our code has been printed. Now you must have understood a little bit about the working of this box.This runs only once, first of all, once we have created the box, its work is done next time, what always happens before going into the loop, first of all, what are our steps before going inside the loop, let me write the steps here. Okay, so the first thing is the condition that is checked. First of all, our condition is checked. If it is true, then it will move ahead. If it becomes false, then the loop is over. Okay, then what is the next thing we do? The condition is checked like it is done. Come inside the loop. Okay, come inside the loop.
