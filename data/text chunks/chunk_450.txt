re, then again plus plus will come here, it will print the value. So in this way, we can run a loop. If we repeatedly plus plus a pointer inside that loop, then it will access the further memory locations.It will remain the same whether we are taking input or output. If we try this then we will understand better from the code. First of all, let us create an array named int as the base. Let s keep its size here because entering 10 numbers will be a bit inconvenient. Now first of all we will input the value of this array. To get the input, we have to input it with the help of a pointer, so let s create a pointer which is pointing to the first memory location.
