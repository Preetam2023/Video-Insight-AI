hoever has to be scanned, we will write in it pointer p a i.e. the pointer is pointing to the index.On the second position we will do t, on the second position we will do 3, on the third position it will keep on increasing one by one data type in this way, then scanning will be done here, then let s put another loop for the output i take 10 i print f d, the value is in the index, percentage d. Now here first we will print the index, after that we will print the value. To print the value, we can also do ptr aa, so let s do this once and then one more.If you see a slight change in the syntax, then we are putting 12 13 14 15 and 16 on the index. Here, if the size of our base is five, then we need to change it to five instead of 10 because this time we are making our array not of 10 size but of five size. Let s run it once again. 12 13 14 15 and 16, so now 12 has come on the first index.13 has come on the second, 14 on the third, 15 and on the fourth.
