r, then if there are any other factors of a composite number, then they bring the meaning inside it.The factor of any number will always be smaller than that, it is never bigger. The factor of 8 cannot be 16. Okay, so that s why we are running from 2 to n 1. Okay, don t consider one because that will be the correct answer. Now we will do i ps and here you directly apply the if condition. First of all, the value of aa is two. Okay, if I say if which is my number n, if it is divisible by aa, that is, a.Modus a is equal to ictu 0, this means we have seen in our previous lecture, so you can do one thing, print it brother, no, we have found out that our number is less, okay, we will run it once for 25 and see if it happens, now once we run this code first and then we will see about it, there is a lot of fluff in it, we are okay, if we run then enter the number, then I say 25, okay, then see what is written.
