e and the other way can be written, then this is the case with us, operations of same president i.e. multiply has same president and divide also has same president, so which one will be solved first, then for this we have associativity rule, these are the rules.No, these may look dangerous but they are very logical. There is no need to memorize them right now. As we solve different problems, we will also solve our practice problems. They will come on their own and are very logical to understand. Just remember their names, it was called associativeness, it was called President, there are such heavy words. There is absolutely no need for rote learning right now. The notes will be completely available to you, you can go and revise them anytime.We can also access associativity. We use it whenever we come to operators of same presidency. Like if we talk about our example, associativity says to do left to right i.e. keep performing operations from left to right.
