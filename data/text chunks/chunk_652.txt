ve times because we have to read the entire l , let s save it and run it too, so pay attention here.If we look at our output screen, first of all it read A, then it read P, then again it read P in the character and then the fourth character which it read is L and the fifth character is E, so in a way we go character by character and our entire word has been read. Now suppose here, we do not store characters, we store some numbers like 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 8. So now we have stored these numbers.Now we do not store the characters, they also take the case text. This time we have to read the data of integer type. Let us keep it constant and for the integer type here, we will have to change only the percentage D and SI. We have written only three numbers, that is, there are only three numbers inside the test, so we will scan and print it only three times. Let s save and run it once. First of all, 1 2 3 has been read for us and it has come.
