to calculate the sum. So we write void calculate sum in it. Three vectors will be passed inside it. The first one will be the strict vector, that will be v1, after that will come the strict vector v2, after that will come the strict vector sum, to create this function.Let s define here, what we have to do is that the x component of the sum will be theWhat we are missing out here is that whenever the function is called, it is passed by value, so here the sums that we have assigned values will not be reflected inside the main function, that is why to reflect them, we either pass a pointer or get our sum printed inside this function. Print sum of a is percentage d sum d x and sum for our component sum of y is sum dva put here.
