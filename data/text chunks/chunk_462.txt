e n 1, n 2, we can make as many arrays as we want, but the size of all will remain the same with us. And how to visualize the matrix?Now let s try one question from the help, now here we are talking about 2D arrays, we also have 3D arrays, there are 4D arrays, there are 5D arrays too but these are not used that much in programming. Mostly the questions you will get are going to come from 2D arrays. Now let s make a 2D array. We will make an array in such a way that we are storing the marks of three subjects of two children.This thing has to be kept in mind that if we have to store the marks of three subjects of two children, then let s create a 2D array named Marks, the size of which will be two and three, that is, two arrays are being made. In what way will it be stored in the memory, first three locations will come, after that three more locations will come. In this, the marks of three subjects of the first student will be stored.
