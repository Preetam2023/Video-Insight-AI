print it directly. We have created a box named j . We want to know what value of j will be printed. Oh, this is a very dirty thing, look, the value of j is coming 3375 826. Okay, so what should the computer say?The value of j is this, whereas I have not given any value to j. Now because the value of j is so dirty, then of course, this is such a big value, our th is a very big number, it is not smaller than 10, whereas here it is written that when j is smaller than 10, then run this loop and keep running till it is smaller than 10. If it is not there, then the loop is not running, so this is our concept of garbage value here.
