e the whole false. Now the second question says if it is Monday and it is raining then make it true. Either it is Monday or it is raining then it will be printed as true here and in place of whatever is there, we will do our logical and operator so we will make it is Sunday, it is Monday, we will make this knowing that it is raining here.But if it is not Monday then we will make it zero. If it is raining then we will make it one. Here we do it is Monday. Here we make it is raining. Now there is one condition which is false, one condition is true. Now if any of the two is true then we have to print it as true. So for that we will use logical and and let s run it and see that it will be printed. Our pass is true. The third condition says if a number is greater than n i.e. a number is x.If it is greater than nine and less than 100 is less than 100 then we will print it as true. So we have to check for one number that it is greater than nine and that same number is less than 100.
