t?One thing, we have a question, let s say 1 2 3 4 5 n is given, then how do I store five, that is, how do I take the value of five, so tell me one thing, if I modify 1 2 3 4 5 or any number by 10, then what do I get? I will always get its last digit, always try it, no matter what the number is, I say 998 10.So look, 10 9 90 is left here, 98, 10, 9, 90. Reminder is 8. So if you divide any number by 10, the answer is the same, which is the last digit. Reminder, that becomes ours. Okay, this is a very obvious thing. If it was 3, 4, 0, it would be completely divisible, so that s why five is our reminder, so this is clear to you here.What will we do if we get a hint? We can take a new variable again and again. We can take it inside the loop itself. Which one? First retrieve the last digit and add it inside the sum. Sum is equal to sum plus which last digit. So we can write this variable like this. We can also create a variable by adding or adding the last digit.
