ll we do for a positive number? We will check if the number is greater than equal to 0 in that case.For the number in I, we will be printing it as positive and if it is not so, it means else. Well, we can write this else here also. Usually, I prefer to write it in the same line, then for else, we will print it as negative. Now inside this, as soon as the number becomes positive, then we have to check whether our number is even or odd. We will print that too. So here we can write one more f that the number is modo two if our equal.The condition of doubles becomes two zero. We have already read it in the practice set of Chapter Two, so it should be quite easy for us to understand that how here we have checked that the number is even, so here we will print it. If it is not even, then it can also have its own else. We are going to print it as odd. Let s save it. Now let s run it once. We enter the number that is 24.
