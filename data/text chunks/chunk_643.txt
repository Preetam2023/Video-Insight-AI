open it in RB mode, then the file is read in binary format, so it will usually be for binary files. It is not of much use to us right now, but yes, if in your question paper, in the test in your college, a question comes that you should open a binary file.Or if you open it in binary form, then you have to keep in mind that we have to use r as mode. No, now there is no special thing about both of these functions. One special thing about these two functions is that if suppose the file does not exist, you want to call h and load s, no one has ever created it, then what will happen, then null will be stored inside the pointer, so in write mode, in read mode and in read binary mode, both. If your file does not exist then a null pointer will be created inside the pointer i.e. it will be stored next, let s talk about our write key, your intention inside the write mode is that you want to write something inside the file and write binary i.e.
