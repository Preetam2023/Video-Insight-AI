? If we make the count also plus plus then we will make the count also plus plus every time because.Till the time the null character comes, the count will also be plus plus because we are counting all the characters and at the end we will return our count. Let s call it from our main function. Print F with the percentage D. Length is the count length in which we will pass our name. Let s save and run. First of all, we have to enter our string. After entering the string, we got the length. What did it do to the length? Now count the null character also.How have we counted the null character because the count which is already there is already becoming plus plus, meaning whenever we are sending the count inside this function, the value of count is increasing in the same way as the value of i is increasing.
