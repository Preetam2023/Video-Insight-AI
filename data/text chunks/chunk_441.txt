by one because one byte is incrementing, like here it is 2000, here it is 2001 and here it is 2002. If we created a variable named star in which star isIt is stored i.e. Asteris is stored and the pointer is pointing to it, so as soon as you change it to plus plus, the pointer will start pointing. If you change it to minus, then the pointer will start pointing. Let s verify this by coding it too. Here we will make care star equal to ast risk. In this we will store the address of the star and then again the values of the points. So first of all the value of the pointer should be the end.If you changed from 0 to sane to plus plus then it came to 0 to 8 because the character will be increased by one byte and if you did minus minus then it became 0 to s. So in this way if you have questions whether points have to be incremented or decremented then do not get confused in those questions. Just add the size. If 1 is written in the integer then it does not mean 1, it means 4.
