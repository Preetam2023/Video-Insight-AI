those special characteristics, those special properties are there to access those special functions.For this, we need to use null character, so here we have initialized a string named name and stored it inside it. There is not a single way to initialize the string with a null character. There are two ways. We have already seen the first method, in which what we are doing is by concatenating different characters and putting a null character at the end of it, but we also initialize the string like a whole word.We have put initialism quotes and inside we have written our complete name. Now here you can ask Didi, the back slash 0 i.e. null character has not come in it, so I would say that if we like this in our string, the C compiler automatically inserts the initialism null character, that is, you will write this much and what will C do? It will automatically insert the back slash zero. Now one more thing to notice here is that whenever you write the character, there are single codes.
