inter? Structure complex of number one. Now we have to print the values, so we can get them printed. The imaginary part is equal to percentage d.How to print from pointer, first of all we will write parenthesis or here we will use arrow operator, then PTR arrow will be real here, real will be there and here PTR arrow will be imaginary and base sl n, so let s save it and now let s run it, so the real part is printed with us, five and the imaginary part is printed with us, and in this way, even with imaginary real numbers, like if you have Magni Doodle, then it is under.The score is the square of the imaginary part plus the real part. So now if we have to calculate the magnitude of the complex or the magnitude of the vectors, then that is our under root, the square of the imaginary part plus the square of the real part. So we can calculate that also and get it. So, we have the full capability to complicate it a little based on these structures.
