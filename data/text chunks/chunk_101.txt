r within the same range, then it is a factor of it. See, it being zero means that it is a factor of.n Okay, so I found out directly that the number is composite, there is no need to run the loop further, okay so far. I didn t find out whether the number is prime or not but no problem, I don t need to run the loop further, so we know what we do in this, pay attention inside this statement, I printed it, now look here, I will write break semicolon, now you will see it is coming in pink color, so it is clearly visible, the pink thing is visible, you can see the include is in pink, for is in pink, return is in pink, all these are special keywords, it is clearly visible in front of this.Nothing else has to be written. Do you know the meaning of this break? Now like if I run with this break, suppose I write Ch , enter number six, it is written only once. The number is composite . Suppose I have removed it, I write Enter a number 12 in 12 , then see how many times it has been written.
