s, it will be printed. So we know that our address inside the pointer is 1020 and stored above 1020.This is our edge variable in which our edge is 22, so what will it do, first it will go to this address, then it will go to the value at this address, then it will print this value, so 22 will be printed here too, 22 will be printed here too, now let s see the combination of both, here first of all we wrote the address of edge, from here we have the address of edge, then we wrote star Eric s value at that address, then edge sAddress has come 210 it will say give me the value on it then what is the value on 2 10 then it will come here first of all the address of the edge is the address of the edge is 1020 and it will say value at 1020 give me the value at 1020 what is this 22 so here also we will have only 22 printed, let us verify it with the code first of all we haveWe had learned how to print the address. Now we will learn how to print the value.
