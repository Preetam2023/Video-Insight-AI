e function. First of all, what we did was ask for the nationality and store it in the character set. After that, we compared the character with I and if there is a match.Then call Namaste function. If there is no match and we go inside the if condition then we will call Ban Jure. Below we have given the definition of both the functions, what is the meaning of both the functions, let s save and run it. Now what will we do? Enter F for French and I for Indian. If we are Indian then we will enter I, then Namaste is printed for us. Run this code again and enter F, this time it is printed as Ban Root.In this way, according to the conditions given by the user, we can write different functions and execute different codes. The next thing we will talk about is some properties of the function. The first property in the function is named that execution always starts from main. It means whenever we are talking about C program, in fact whether we talk about C or Java program, our code.
