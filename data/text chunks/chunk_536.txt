verifying should not happen that we have just read the theory theory and we have not tried its code. So first of all we create a character string, the first string inside which we store L, then we create the second string inside which we store it and now we print the percentage D because it will be printed as an integer. For comparison, we will print ST R C M P in which we will first pass the first string and then we will pass the second string. Save and run. So it is printed as 1, which was expected because aWhich is 65, unit of b is 66, then 65 66 will be a negative value which will show that the first string is smaller than our second string. Now if we change these values i.e. first pass our second string and then pass our first string then what will be the output in that case. In that case the output will be a positive value i.e. 1 1. This is because b a is here now and by doing one more small thing.
