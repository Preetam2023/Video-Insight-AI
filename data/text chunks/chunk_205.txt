will be calculated so this thing is going to be calculated first friend after that it will be added.So, there is no need to put brackets in it, let s see once also, the answer will be the same. If I try seven, suppose I do nine, then my answer should be how many fives. If I did the previous code, the same would come. If I do seven, the answer would be four. In the previous code also four was coming, so of course, this is a better code for the computer. If n comes big, then we can do it directly without the for loop. Okay, let s move ahead, friend.Let s solve the next question, this is a very very important question, I am putting a star, so it is okay here, it is going to be very useful in the future, that means it will build your foundation, there will be many of our RK medium level questions, there will be easy level questions which you learn from this, if it is okay, then it does a basic form, if it is doing a basic form, then the question is print the factorial of a given number, ok
