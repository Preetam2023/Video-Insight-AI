ere instead of i, this time we take a different variable, if we take s, then i inside the character.The key value is stored and we will keep increasing s until its value is less than equal to z. We will make s plus plus every time. We know that the characters which are internally converted to their ESCA values are only numbers. If you scroll on a then its s key value is 97. If you scroll on z then its value is 122. So what will happen to b. A is 97 b.It will be 98, so if we keep increasing in this manner, then whenever we are increasing the character, that is, we are going from a to b, from b to c, from c to d, here every time we will get our character printed. If we save our character as C, then this time we will see that all the letters in our English alphabet have been printed from A to the end. So, in this way, whatever is our item, we can also take it as a character.We can also take it as int, we can also take double, it depends on what problem we are solving.
