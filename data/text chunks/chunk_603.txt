But every time we declare a variable of the structure, we will call it computer engineering student.That s why I don t want to write Student instead of Computer Engineering Student , every time I write Structure Computer Engineering Student , I go for a simple name instead of that, so I took that simple name as COE, student s1 in COE and this COE means the structure of the name Computer Engineering Student, so how will this thing be possible, it will be possible with the type def keyword, so whenever we define the structure, we first type in it.Def after that structure and after that the full name of our structure. Then normally we have to define all the parameters of that structure, close the parenthes and then write its alias i.e. this is the real name of our structure and this is its nickname by which we will be calling it.
