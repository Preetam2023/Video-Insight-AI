types of operators in C. We have relational operators which tell the relation between two operands. We have logical operators which bring out the logical thing between the two. Then there are also bit wise operators. Now we had talked about that inside the machine language, inside the machine code, everything is in the form of zeros and ones and in between those zeros and ones ifWe do operations, we call them bitwise operations, then there are also assignment operators, then one is ternary operator, this is our conditional operator, that is, if according to some condition we have to do something and do not do another thing, we can also write it with the help of ternary operator, it is also written with the help of ifs, it is also written with the help of ifs, it is also written with the help of majors. The thing to understand in this is relational, logical and assignment. These three are the easiest among them.After the matrix, we will read them now.
