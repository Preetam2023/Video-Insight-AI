Output. Now to understand this, first of all, let us understand the memory of our computer a little. There are two types of memory present inside our computer, one of them is volatile memory, that is, as soon as the power of the computer is switched off.You unplug the laptop, the battery gets discharged, similarly this memory evaporates and there is another type of memory, our non volatile memory, this memory stores such data inside itself which does not change due to power failure, it remains the same as whenever you open your computer, maybe you have downloaded a game, then every time you will see that game, you can open it or you have the power of the cutter gets exhausted. If your laptop is switched off, what will happen when you come back?You may not be able to see that file or the new changes you made in it may not be visible to you because they were stored in our volatile memory. Now the volatile memory inside the computer is RAM, we also call it random access memory.
