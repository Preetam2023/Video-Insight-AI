eserved by this array, then it will be our 12 bytes because it takes memory to store three integers.Total 12 bytes will be consumed inside, so in this way, if we ever want to know that character, if we have to store any character array inside which we are storing 10, then we know how much memory the character takes one byte and how many characters we are storing is 10, then how much memory we are taking is total 10 1 i.e. 10 bytes. In the same way, if we suppose we have to store another integer array in which we are storing role.Numbers and we have stored the roll numbers of 30 children, so we know that integer takes four bytes and we are storing them, so for 30 children, we are storing 30 integers. So the total memory consumed inside the memory is 30 4 that is 120 bytes. So such questions come many times in our college exams in which they are asked how much memory will be reserved, we have to tell it.
