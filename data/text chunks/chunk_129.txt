e power 8, which should be a big value, will not be printed here, rather it will be printed as zero. How will zero be printed? Once we see it in the code, let s remove all this and get it printed here. 8 zero is printed because what the compiler did is not take it as power of 8. It took it as 8 equal to 8. And when equal number is equal to same number, then zero is always in the output, that is why here we have.Zero has come in the output. This is a bitwise operator about which we have already talked about it. We will talk about it later. And its output does not give us power. For power we have to use the PO DB POW function. But did this statement run? Yes did this statement run? Did the compiler return any error? No? The compiler did not return any error. That s why the statement does not give us power, but it is a valid statement. Let s talk about the second statement int x.
