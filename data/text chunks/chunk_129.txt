appening man that my loopGoing on, going on, going on, let s discuss a little bit about this, let s fine fine it loops, look at what usually happens in a loop, there is an inital exit condition and one of our as far as we are going to terminate, so if I write that here, if I write int aa 1 and here I write while as long as my aa is less than 10, see the problem, now print aa here, then print f.Percentage D here put a but here subtract the value of a from one i minus minus means subtract from one so know the problem in this code what is coming first the value of i what happened to us if I write in the box see the value of i becomes one first then what is printed in the output let s go what is less than 10 condition checked yes it is small ok print one ok here we are.
