s to be stored then int double star pptIf you want to store the address, then float double star PPT. Now this PPT R is the name of a variable, which means it is not necessary that you keep PPT. For understanding, I have written it in this way to show it as pointer to pointer. Character double star double star star. This is also a pointer to pointer because its type is character star star. Now let s talk about a practice question. Now pointer toLet s actually create the pointer and see what we will do. Let s create a variable. First of all, the variable is of floating type. This time let s make the price. The value inside the price is stored 00. Now we will create a new pointer float star PTR PTR will store the address of price. Now we will create another new pointer. This will be pointer to pointer i.e. PPT R. We will store it inside PPT R. We will store the address of PTR then PTR.
