finally our array will be inverted. This will be done by creating a new array and let s dry run it. Dry run is done in coding where you analyze the output of the code before running it. Suppose there is an area of size five. Now the first thing we will do is start the loop. How will we start the loop? In the beginning the value of our i is 0 and the value of n i 1 is 4, so this will be the first value, this will be the second value. We will remove the second value in this position i.e. put five.We will remove this and put the first value i.e. one, then i will become plus plus i, here this will become the first value, this will become the second value, after this we will remove this and put the second value, after that we will remove this and put the first value, after that it will be i p i, our i will come. If earlier it was one then this time it will become two. Now we will see that the value of i which is two is less than our 5 2 5 2 integer.
