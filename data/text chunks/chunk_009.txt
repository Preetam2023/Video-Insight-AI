et the password. All this imaginary stuff is going on. We have a function which resets the password. And inside that function, let s assume that we want to print account one dot password or this will be self dot account password.It is absolutely possible to do this thing, that is, here the self dot password will work but here the account and dot password will not work because where is this function, this function is inside the class and this print statement is outside the class, so outside the class we will not be able to access it but inside the class like if I try to call reset password, then this time we will not get any error, this time our password will simply be printed for us, so if there is anything that we canIf we want to keep it only inside the class, then we can make it private.
