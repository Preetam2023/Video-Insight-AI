i 1 i is equal to let s 5 i p plus and if I write this amazing thing of mine here which is print F.Okay, suppose I have written the statement here, now see the amazing thing, if I run, I don t know what will happen if I run, then look, hello pad has come five times, now you will say, maybe this was already written, but look back here, if I replace five with two, I run, then hello pad has come twice. Well, if I replace two with four, then if I run, then hello pad has come four times, so if you don t know anything, but this is clearly an amazing thing.What is it, friend, inside this whole code, if I write something else in this above thing which I don t know the meaning of, but if I write nine in place of this four, then it will come nine times.
