which is not included in the code, these are our extra instructions. Now comments are of two types. Inside C, the first ones are our single line comments which we write by putting double slash and after that we haveMultiple line comments which we write in this format. Now let s actually write comments in our code and see how they are written. Like inside this code we have told inside what data types are, so here we can write a comment by putting double slash. This code displays how data types work in C. So this is something which is written in English and is not a part of the code. Similarly, suppose we have to write comments in multiple lines, then we would write.These are slush ast risk and ast risk slash and in between we could have written anything. This is a multi line comment, so we are writing some things on our multiple lines and this is all part of the comment.
