al to a len e 100, then we write a pps, you might have understood some things and now it is amazing.See, the thing I am going to do is print F Percentage D and write here I will run this code, the count from 1 to 10 will be printed, now see how it will be, see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Actually this is what is written, see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19 See 20 21 toIt got printed up to 100 and of course if we want to make it a little more beautiful, then let s look a little here. If we give a space in front of the percentage D, it will come like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 up to 100. If we put a bar n here in front of the percentage D, then it gets printed in different lines. Okay, but why is this happening? Let s talk about it once. First of all, we will look at the space.Let s give it because we can see it completely, it will look better in the code. Okay, even though I had asked another question, here s why this is happening. Let s try dry running this code once.
