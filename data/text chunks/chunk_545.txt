ll be put inside your password can also be anything, our saltis remains this, now the question is our saltis, the question says that to the user.Get a password entered, the user has entered his password and inside it is our salt. Add it at the end i.e. we will enter the password from the user and at the end we will add the salt tooth and after that the new password has to be printed back to the user, then how will we get it done. Suppose the user has entered his password, his test and salt is our T3, so now we have to give a new password, the new password should have its value, we will give the test and salt at the end.If we add that means tooth then this is our new Password will be created for which we have to give it back to the user, so we will write a program for it. We are going to create a function. What will this function do? It will take our string and then create a new string. New password in which it will copy the old string plus add our tooth behind it.
