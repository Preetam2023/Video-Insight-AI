ber, this is a very good question for your semester.Media has every chance of appearing in the exam. It has to come in one of the ends, okay is this done or reverse number, this question means it is standard, it comes as it comes, okay, there is no one of these, there is no that, okay, so we write our code, I write int main function and then I write return zero, okay, now we write our code, so first of all, of course, we have to input a number, so assume this is our number, then we also write that print F, enter a number.Okay and we take the input of the number, man, from our which scan F, we do this work so scan F, percentage D and and A and where did it go man and here is the and A. Okay, now we have to do our whole process, I have to tell whether the number is prime or the number is composite, so I can tell directly as soon as I hit my condition, meaning as we come here, I saw that 25 modus 2 is equal to rho, meaning what is two to.
