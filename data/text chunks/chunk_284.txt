s of our statement terminator. This is a normal type of function which we have already talked about. How can we write the function in another way? First of all it will be written as void i.e. the function does not return any value. For example, suppose we have to create a function whose name is print table. It takes any number and prints its table. Now it does not have to return anything, just print it, so in its parameters i.e. the value that isIt will definitely have a number in it, the number of which it has to print the table, then that number is our int n, so it will take this number n and get its table printed and will not return anything back. The third way of writing the function is that we have a return type, like in the case of even, we have taken int as a return type and what is this function doing? It is taking two parameters, the first parameter is a, the second parameter is b, it will take both the parameters and will create an even value from them which will be a b.
