rithm here and build it into it. You don t have to do anything, you just have to declare a variable. Let s store its factorial inThis is just a product. n factorial means from five to one. It is a product from n to one. So you create a variable named int product. Okay, just like you were making int sum. Since then, create a variable named int product and multiply it by one. Why do you have to do it from one. I know the sum. Okay, if I had to find the sum of 5 p 4 p 3 2 p 1, then what would you do. You would put a loop and keep adding a again and again.Now I just have to do the same work, I have to keep multiplying, what does it mean if my product is already one, if I put a for loop where from aa till n till aa ev till lane is equal to n where our number is going and in every iteration of the loop in every round what should I just write my product multiply inside the product product e is equal to product into whatever is our aa like aa will be our one first then 1 nav then eight.
