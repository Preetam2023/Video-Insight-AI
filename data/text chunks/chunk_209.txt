it we write our condition and then inside we write those statements which will do some work for us. So in the code we had just written that we have to print the numbers from one to four, we had already written the code in the for loop.Now once we compare the syntax of for and while, how was the code written in the for loop? for int i 1 aa till len is equal to 5 aa ps ps. Here we were printing the percentage d of our i. Now the same is true. What will be the conversion in the while loop? Then we will write our key keyword while. What is our condition? Here, our variable has to be declared outside, that is, inside our code, in for, we had declared the variable inside the parenthesis, but this time we have to declare the variable outside here because there is no space in while. Either you put it inside the while, but then it cannot be used here, in the condition, it must be outside.
