do directly is by removing this sum, we will write here a b and save it and run our code once again. 2 5. So directly we have seven, which is our sum. If it gets printed thenWe did not need to create a third variable. Whenever we had to print the sum, if we had to print the difference here, then we could have written minus instead of plus. If we had to print the product of both, then we could have multiplied them by doing asterisks. In this way, whatever value has to be printed, we can do operations on it directly and we can write it here. Now we have learned a lot of things in C and how to run all these things.We wrote these in a file and from that file the output started coming to us. Now we call this entire process as compilation. Let us understand this process as to what actually happens. The definition of compilation is that it is a computer program that translates C code into machine code.
