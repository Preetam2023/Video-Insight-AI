e, now see what we need here, our initialization condition and increment, so we can see this series. For h, our initialization int aa should be equal to itself because there is one, then what should be our condition that till when aa can go from maximum to maximum i.e. the last term which is being formed by us which is 2n my so aa should be less equal to two till it can go till 2n 1 and here again i i 2 our condition will be i p not i i 1It will not happen because there is a jump of two, if it was of three, then we would write three here. Okay, so i i 2, so let s run this code once and see that most probably this should work. So we write here 2n 1. I am about to make a very grave mistake, I have already done it here. Okay, before running the code, friend, you must be getting an error, why is this 2n coming red, then see friend, 2n is not like this, we write 2n in maths.Look here, if in mathematics we write it on a separate page, here we write it.
