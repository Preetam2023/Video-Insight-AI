rmed. The index for row is five. The index for one is the index for two. The index for two is three.If you are not able to think on your own how to find the second value, then it is not a problem because these things come with practice. In this way, you must have reversed an array six times. After that, you will remember that it is reversed from n i 1 because this is the classical way. Whether you are programming in c or in Java, you are doing it in c every time whenever an array is created.If we have to reverse n i 1, we will have to use n i 1, then here we will write second value is array of n i 1, so the first value has arrived, second value has arrived, now process the exchange, how will we do the exchange, we will put the second value in the array of i and the array of n i 1, we will put the first value, so this is our value exchange and here we will end the loop, then finally our array will be inverted. This will be done by creating a new array and let s dry run it.
