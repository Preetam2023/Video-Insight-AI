rred and this is an error which is a run time error, meaning the compiler will not be able to check. If you make such a mistake, when you are accessing something bigger than the size of the array, then the compiler will not tell you that you are making a mistake, your program will tell you in the run time that you have made a mistake and will stop there like here.But we wrote three, whereas inside the array, the size is only three, which has gone to 0, one and two. Now for three, we needed to increase the size of this array to four, so we cannot write it because it will give us an error, that is why whenever we are creating an array, we have to pay attention that we are not going beyond our maximum index as far as we can go. Next we are going to talk about the practice question. We can answer this question very easily.
