o one. So, we have put an end here between both the conditions.That is, both of ours should be true. Every time we are making i plus plus because we are calculating the sum, then every time we can also make j minus minus because we are printing our numbers in reverse order. So now let s save this and let s run this. Now we have printed 3 2 1 and at the end the sum is six. What was happening earlier? The sum is six was printed first. The numbers were printed later this time.The numbers are printed first because till the time the sum is being completely calculated and then it is being printed, there is a statement of the numbers being printed before the sum is printed. Also, what can we do with this, we can also remove this income completely. If we remove the income completely, then what will happen to it, j which is ours, its value is going from n to 1. Now whether we take the sum of 1 2 3 or we take the sum of 3 to 1, the sum of both is ultimately six.
