sum e 0, first okay, then give a number, I wrote even equal a p b, then I go back to something here.I am going to try to look very carefully what I am going to do, I have made even as A plus B, then I will put B inside my A and put even inside B. Okay, this is how I am playing with the variables, I will try to explain to you, here come to the next page, I hope to make the boxes, I will need Y in front of you, otherwise normally, anyone can explain. Okay, let s say this box is my A. This box is my B. This box is my even.First I put one in A and B. Understand in the sum, I either put zero or nothing, then what I am saying here every time is that friend, I put the value of a and b in the sum. Okay, so a and b are 2. I put two inside the sum. Then what do I do after this, friend, after this either look at the sum, we can print that number, after this we can do one thing that put the value of b inside a, okay a.
