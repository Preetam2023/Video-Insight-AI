do with it, all the numbers should be printed, let s dry run it once and after fully disclosing it.Let s finish the statement quickly. Okay, it s a matter of two minutes. Continue statement is not going to be of much use to you. Well, it may be useful in some codes. Okay, this is just like an alternate. The kind of it is not necessary. Break statement is very necessary, but see what is happening. Let s do a dry run. The value of i is one. Of course, it is going up to 100. So, first of all, I checked that the value of my a is one, is it from one to two?Is divisible, no, then this if condition did not work, okay, we went straight to print FI, here if we see the output, print FI, then one is printed with a space, come, okay, here again we went to the value aa, two is done, lesson 100, yes, go ahead, if two is divisible by my two, yes, so we went inside the loop, inside the loop, here it is written continue whenever inside the loop, when you saw the break.
