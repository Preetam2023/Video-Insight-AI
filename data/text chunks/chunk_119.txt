pression and then analyze the final output, then here if true is given then the output will be true. If if false is given in the output, then true will be false in the output.Even if true is given, the output will be true but both will be false. Only if false is coming in our output, then this is our logical or. Apart from this, there is another special operator which is our logical not operator. Logical not operator says that if true is given then make it false. If false is given then make it true i.e. whatever is given to us, we have to invert it inside the expression, whatever it may be, like if an expression is 3 4, we know that it is false.If the second expression is 5 1, we know that it will give true, but if we put not there, it will give false, so in this way, whenever the output of the expression has to be reversed, we have to flip, then we put not, here we know that 5 1 will give us true, but if we put not next to it, then in the output we will get false i.e.
