world, so in this way our print hello function prints hello to us from hello world or let s save it. Now how to call print hello low means how to get hello printed. So our calling will be done here, here we will write print hello, the name of our function, then pansies and then terminator.So this is our declaration or function prototype, this is our function call and the main thing here is our function definition, let s save it and run it once, compile and run from the terminal, then hello has been printed for us, here is the next line. Now if we want, instead of writing print F again and again, we can print this hello again and again. How to call the function, so we called the function once, now we call the function again.In fact, we call our function three times, save it and run it, so what happened to us is that Hello is printed three times. Now we can get the work done by our function any number of times.
