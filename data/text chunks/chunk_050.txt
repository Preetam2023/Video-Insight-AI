edge. We have printed 22. Edge is 22, so whatever edge we had entered has come back to us in print. Here, what scanf did was to enter the edge and go to whatever location in the memory the edge variable was pointing to. We stored that edge, stored that number 22 and when print FWhen we asked for that number back, after that it got printed as edge is and here it showed that the value of int type has to be printed and then we took out the data from inside edge and showed it on our screen, this is how our input output works. Now here we are going to make a small program inside C. What we will do in this small program is take the input of a number A, take the input of a number B and we will output the sum of these two, that is, we are going to write a small code.
