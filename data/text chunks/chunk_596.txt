Arrow one the best. If I want to use it, then a feeling of personalization starts coming in my code. Yes, we have chosen the syntax as per our wish. Let s talk next. Passing Structures to Function In the same way we can pass variables of different data types, we can also pass variables of structures to a function. Just as we used to pass a number of integer type a and integer type b to a function, in the same way, the variables we create here in structures Student One Student Two Student Three, we can also pass them inside our functions.For example, how do we write the functions which have a structure inside their parameters? Normally, we write the type of the function i.e. the return type and then the name of the function and if we have to write the parameter structure inside it, then first of all we will write the type like we used to write int a, then here in place of int will come structure student and in place of a i.e. in the name of the variable, we will have s1.
