p or not and if the correct answer comes out then it means that you have understood the points well. If not then it means that you need to go and see some of the concepts behind, then once we write the answer, we have made a 5 and b 5. This happened because here we should have written a temporary variable, let s clear it and if we compile and run once again then the value of a should be five.And the value of b has become three. Here in the beginning what wasWhat will we do, we will take pointer int star A, int star B, call by reference void under swap, inside this we are coming to points of and pointer of B. Now if we have variables in pointer, then whatever we make temporary, we can also make it in the form of pointer. Now here we will create a new variable called temporary T. Inside this T, first of all we will store the value of A and the value of A and then the key of A.In the value we will put the value at address of b. Now in the value at address of b we will put the value of t.
