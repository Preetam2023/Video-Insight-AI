installed the latest C on my system. Now let s try it once and see how our gates and puts will work.We made a name of 100, now what will we do, take its input, first of all we will just write get s and atr, then we will write put s and atr, save it, let us change this name to atr, now run it once, as soon as we run it, a warning came here that this program uses gets which is unsafe, so get s should not be used, but still we put something in our string, hello world, we entered it and we have hello.When the world came back to one, what did Gates do? It took the entire Hello World, that is, it also took the thing after the space. Now what will we do here after entering our full name, we will see how to enter the full name. First of all, we will write our first name, then we will write our last name. I am a good student, in fact, we write the entire line. So now what did the test do, it got the entire line printed with us. In this way, whenever we had to take multi word sentences.
