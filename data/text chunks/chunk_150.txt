e beginning printed statement, but it did not count the second printed statement along with the if .It counted separately, then came this else after else, thought where is its if because for this there is no if above, normal statement is written above, instruction is written, that is why there is no confusion in this way, whenever we have to write any program, we always have to put curly braces in it, no matter how many lines there are, now whenever our if is not true, after that if we have to check whether any other condition is true, is the above one not true or the below one?If the one is true, then we write Else If Else If. What is the format of writing? If we have written above, then we can put our condition one inside it, then whatever if we have to do, put it in the first block, then write else if, put the condition true inside it, like if we take the example of marks, if our marks are greater than 90, then you print a and here check that the marks are what they are.
