is the index inside the string. Let us see this in the form of an example to see what we want to do. Here we have passed a string atr whichSuppose inside we have given Hello World and now we have created a new SDR, the new SDR is empty now, that means a lot of space in it will be empty, here we have passed n 3 and m 6, so this loop is 0 1 2 3, our loop will be starting from this l and for new s, it will be starting from j 0, here it will be starting from i 3, so first of all we will copy this l here i.e. bring it here and copy it.Bring this here, bring this here and bring this here, our loop will run in this manner, so first of all we will copy for i 3 and bring l here, then it will become j and i will become 4, then we will copy o also, then j will become two, then we will copy w, then j will become 3. By then, i will also become our six, so we will copy this o here, so as soon as i6 happens, our slice is finished and the final string which we will return will be in that.
