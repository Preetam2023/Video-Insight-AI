ents, we make a small mistake that we forget a rule. Our rule says declare variable before using it. Whenever we are using any variable, we must declare it before using it, that is, we have to see that there is any valid value inside it. We have already told the compiler.That this variable exists in the code and then we use it. If this will not happen and the C compiler will suddenly see a variable and where it came from, then it will throw an error like if you look at its valid examples, here we have declared int a as 22. Then in int b it is written that put the value of a in b. This is absolutely correct because a has already been declared and then its value in b.The value is given and if we write it in the form of code, then inside our function we can write int a 22 and then write if int b a, then here we did not get any A error. This code which is ours will work very well. After that, what can we do if we are writing in this way also int c b 1 i.e.
