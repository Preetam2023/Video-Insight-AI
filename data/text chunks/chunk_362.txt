ue is stored at the address where the pointer is stored, then for that we can use this operator i.e. here weWe are creating a new variable, Underscore Edge, inside which we are storing the value address PTR, that is, take out the value of whatever address is inside the pointer and store it in that new variable. What will happen? First of all, this new variable will be created. The name of the new variable will be Under Edge. It can have some other address. Suppose this is 2011. Now inside it, the value of whatever address is stored on the pointer.Value at Address Which is Stored at Pointer Address Stored in Pointer If the value is 210 then we will go to 210 and see what value is there, then the value stored near the pointer is 210 and what value is stored at 20110, then we will go to 210, the value is stored there, our 22, so we will pick up that 22 value and put it in the new underscore range. Let s do a little recap once.
