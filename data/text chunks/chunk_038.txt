o do this again, you should do this normally. If you have to print, you will write print f1 2 3 100. You will not write it in a line. Here we will talk about loops, which is the variable inside the loop, the int aa that we were talking about, we can do a lot of things by using it. How can it work? Once we see it in the code, you will understand the code, then you will be able to solve the next question well yourself. This is where we come, let s create a new file inside the loops, let s write it here.One, then here we write 100 100 dot C, okay and if we write our code here, then first of all we will write shg include, big headache, friend, writing again and again, okay, tell me the truth, we have to print the count from one to 100, so let s quickly come for int a iv a len equal to a len e 100, then we write a pps, you might have understood some things and now it is amazing.
