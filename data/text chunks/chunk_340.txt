we have written integer values here as 9 5 so this is also an integer. This is also an integer 9 5. If we divide then it will give one but as per rule it should be multiplied with 1.8 so here we make it 99.0.Now let s make it 5.0. Now these are floating values. Now let s run our code. Now we had passed 32 degrees so for us it came to 89.5 1999 degrees. If we pass the normal body temperature which is 37 degrees Celsius then at 37 degrees Celsius you do not have fever. So your body temperature means 98.5 degrees. So whenever we talk about whether you have fever then it is 98 degrees 99 degrees.The fever has become 100 degrees. The fever has become 103. It is actually in Fahrenheit. We have these temperatures in Celsius, so we have written a conversion function. In this way, we have the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion function. We can create it ourselves and there can be other different functions. You can convert all the formulas of physics within one function. That is done in the code.
