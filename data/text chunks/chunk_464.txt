were doing, like if we want to print the marks of the first subject of the first student, then we will just write print f percentage d marks of 0 zero, so this is telling that row e student i.e. our first student is zero of his eighth subject i.e. first.If we look at the subject marks it is 90. Once we get this value printed, in this way we can play with 2D arrays also. It depends on the use case, whether yours is such a case in which you need to create a 2D array. Mostly we are learning basic programming in C, so we will play only with large arrays. There will be a few questions on 3D arrays. We will not be going so much on 3D arrays. That is also possible.We have learned a lot in complex, so let us practice some of its questions.
