to find the sum of the for loop.By using or by using any loop, our code is going to be very simple. First of all, create a sum variable inside which you will store that number in the sum, then you will put your for loop, then write the for here, start with int i 1, take care, go to i n and i ps, you don t have to do anything, you have to add the variable every time inside the sum, that s the end, ok and then print the sum.Do it, it has not become so simple, it has become very simple, here it is okay, the sum is not the sum of the digits but the sum is the whole, so once we print it and see, the sum is here, the percentage is D and the comma is the sum, so let s run this code. First of all, we are doing the basic question, then we will do the good one. Run the code. If I give n as 5, then the answer should be 15. Look, 1 2 3 4 5.15 is similar to 1 to A terms, I have come up with the sum and I will not even do a dry run of it. It is very simple.
