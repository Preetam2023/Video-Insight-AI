hod, when first comes one, then two, then three again.Then 5 6 and in this way our numbers till 100. Now what we have already done is that we have taken a variable inside which the values are getting updated, so why don t we print the value of this variable i again and again. So if we print the value of this variable, then here we will write percentage d and after that i, we will change this 1000 to 100. I hope that the meaning of this is clear to all of us.What is happening is that the value of the variable i is starting from one and will go till 100 and every time the value of i is increasing by one, so what we will do here is that we are going to print the values from one to 100, so all these values from one to 100 have been printed on the output screen. Now we can also decrement this variable, meaning updating does not always mean increasing the value of the variable.
