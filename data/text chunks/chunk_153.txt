Again saying that it is not important but just for your exams, I have to do it, okay, so let s write include here, let s write it here.std d a then we write int main function then we write return zero and then we start our code so do while I was telling something about the while loop, like we write while loop first, suppose I write int aa equals 1 ok or else e equals 11 then I write while pay attention here i is lesson 10 or here p10 write that aa s value is 10I am giving and asked here while aa e lesson 10 so here we write print F ok and you can write anything hello right and here if I write here let s say aa plus plus write anything even if I
