ition is making a difference, like if we had to check the marks, then if a p is printed once above, then a below should not be printed again, we have to take care of it, that is why we are in it.If we use LCF, then we write our own format for LCF also. Let s solve it with an example. We do it in the case of edge only. If edge is greater than 18, then we will write adult. Now, by doing an else if in it, we put the condition that our edge is greater than 13 and and edge is less than equal to 18. Well, here equal to 18 should come and thisIt should be less than 18, so here we will write teenager and in the last we will write else print F child. Thank you, we remove this. Now look carefully, what we have done is ask for age from the user. If our age is 18 or older than 18, then in that case we have to print adult.
