er int star path i m per edge. Now here we can apply this star with an integer or with our variable. Both the syntax are fine and after that what we will do is create a new variable underscore edge and write star ptr in it. What we will do once is print its value. Percentage d a a save and run. So here we have 22 printed and it is light.Let us understand what happened, we had created a variable Edge 22. For that, we created a pointer. What is a pointer? It points to that memory location. It has stored the address of the memory location of Edge within itself. Now if we have to access the value stored at that address, we will extract the value of the address that is on the pointer from it and we put that value in Edge. In the new Edge, when we got the new Edge printed,So the old value came back to us because we had stored the same here, so 22 got printed and came to us, so the syntax of our pointer works in this way.
