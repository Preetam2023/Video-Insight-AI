umbers, then automatic odds.All the numbers which are odd till tx1 are printed for us 1 3 5 7 and 9. Let s do the next question. The next question says that there are two numbers written inside a file. One number is a, the other number is b. These numbers are already written inside the file. Now write a program to replace them with their even. What do we have to do? Suppose this is a file, there are already two and three numbers written inside it.We have to read these two from the file a, we will bring two in b, we will bring three and after cleaning this file from inside, that is, after deleting its data, we have to write the sum of both the numbers in it, that is, there should be only five inside it, at the end, our system will be something like this, so what will be the logic behind doing this, first of all we will read the data, first we will open the file in read mode, after that after closing the file, we will open it in our write mode and as soon as we open it in write mode, the
