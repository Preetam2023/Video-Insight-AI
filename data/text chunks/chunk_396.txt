as four, it was made 16, so our points do something like this when we pass them inside the function. How to pass the points? First of all, whatever function we are creating, it is in its parameters.Will write star n means a pointer is going to come here. Pointer is going to come here i.e. we are going to give the address of a variable here for which we need a pointer variable to store it. So when we wrote the definition, we wrote int star n inside it. Now this is int. Star n, which is n, is a pointer variable. How to access the value whose address is being stored by the pointer? By ast risk i.e. from star, the value at address of n will be equal to the value at address of n multiplied by the value of address of n. So here what we are doing in a way is multiplying it 4 by 4 and storing it back at the same location which is at the address end.
