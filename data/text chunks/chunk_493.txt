s, we ignore this null character in a way, but at the time of declaring, we use this null character.It is important to show the character because the compiler should know whether it is creating a normal character array or a string of words, then once we declare the string, we see the character name inside our main function and inside this we can write our different characters, H R A D H and A and in the last do not forget to put this null character because if we do not put it then it will be a normal character.Now, what is the difference in taking normal characters like an array? Whenever we talk about strings, there are some special properties associated with the strings and we also get some good functions automatically to run on the strings, but they are not on the normal character array, they are only on the strings, so those special characteristics, those special properties are there to access those special functions.
