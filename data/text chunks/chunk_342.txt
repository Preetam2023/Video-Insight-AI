re is a student for whom we have been given marks of three subjects. We have given marks of Science.Calculate Percentage Calculate Percentage takes the marks of three subjects, first of all it will take the marks of Science, then of Math and then of Sanskrit and after calculating the percentage in Int Ger, we will get it back. Now let s define this function Calculate Percentage, inside which we will pass our Science marks. Int Ger Science Int Math and Int Sanskrit. How to calculate the percentage? Let s add all the three marks.Let s divide by 3, multiply by 100, then we will return Science marks plus Math marks plus Sanskrit marks. Divided by 3 and we will multiply this entire value by 100, so in this way we will get the percentage. Now let s make Science marks here. Suppose in Science we have got 98 out of 100, in Math we have got even 95 and in Sanskrit I have got my percentage.I would like to write 99 marks here which came after my lot of hard work in 8th class in Sanskrit.
