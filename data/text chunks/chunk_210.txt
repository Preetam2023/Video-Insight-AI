t e is equal to product into whatever is our aa like aa will be our one first then 1 nav then eight.1 2 product is done, then multiply it by 1. This is what happens. Look, I can write 5 factorials like this too. 1 2 3 4 5. You can write it as per your wish, it is the same thing for both of them. It is ok that you are understanding it very well, so let s do this thing, friend and I hope you have understood the code. It is a very simple code, it is ok, so let s make factorial code here, then factorial.Dot C and here we write all the things again or come here, right, a lot of things, so we can copy and paste, why do we write our code again and again, okay, so see friend, first of all, what we have to do is here because we have to find the factorial, so I took a number n, okay, then I wrote enter a number again, then I took the input, I made a variable in it with the name of product because it is a product and did not initialize it with zero, zero.I will always answer zero.
