or not. Suppose any number x is given to us, the value ofFor example, suppose 4 gets divided by 10. If it gets divided by 5, then what does it give as a reminder? 4 and 2 also give a reminder as zero. So here we have to use our mind to give a reminder to 2. If any number is divided by another, then here we will use our model operator. So what will we do, we will take any number as input. In the input, we have taken one, now we will see the model of x with x, if thisModel becomes zero, there is a case that it becomes zero, it means it is divided, there is a case where it is not zero, other than zero, suppose it is not printed, it is human or mine, anything other than zero means it is not divided, then simply what to do is to take input of a number from the user and then check its module with 2. If the module is returning zero, then it means it is divided, otherwise it is not. Now let s write the code for this and check X first.We declare then scan F and first print F. Enter a number.
