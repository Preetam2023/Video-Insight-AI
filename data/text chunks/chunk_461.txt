ssSo how will we access the elements? If you want to get one array of 0, then it will be this value. If you want to get one array of 1, then this will be this value. If you want to get two array of 0, then this will be the value. If you want to get 1, then this will be this value. Then whenever we have to visualize a 2d array, we visualize it in the form of a matrix. Here this one will be our first array, this one will be our second.If there was a third array, it would come below it. This one would become our third array and the size of each array remains the same. The size of this array is also two. The size of this array is also two. The size of this array is also two. But we can make as many arrays as we want. We can make n arrays, we can make n 1, n 2, we can make as many arrays as we want, but the size of all will remain the same with us.
