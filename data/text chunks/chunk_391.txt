ll by value, so let s write a normal program. Here you might be thinking that suddenly with pointer.How to jump into the function, but now we will learn how functions are related to pointer. So first of all we declare a function, we will name it Square Void Square Int A, we also write its definition Void Square Int n, what will this function do, it will store n in n itself and then we will print the percentage D. Here we write square e equal to b A and n What did this function do, it is an integer.took n Now by multiplying n by n, we stored the square inside the same variable and then we got the square printed. Now inside the main function, we take a number int number e equal to 4 and for that we call square. If we call square, we pass the number in it and then once after getting the square printed, we get that number printed again. Percentage D number is just a number. We made a number, got the square printed of the number and again.
