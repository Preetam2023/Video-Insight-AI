e thing, so if weIf we have to create an alias for our data types, then we use our type def keyword. Now we can create this alias for our integer data type also, we can do it for float as well, we can do it for our care too, but these are already small data types. What else can we create a small variable for them? At the most, what we will do is that we will start calling the character by the name of sich, we will start calling the float by the name of fl.You will start calling int by the name of I but you should not call it because I already use it in a lot of loops but its real usage i.e. the real usage of type def comes when we talk about structures because you can give any name to the structure like here I have taken the example that we have created a structure and we have given it a name. But every time we declare a variable of the structure, we will call it computer engineering student.
