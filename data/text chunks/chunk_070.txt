ode which I just told you the code.Just here I had written a 1 and inside the loop I had done a a 2. In the previous question, you just change something in this. Think for yourself because it is homework. Let s move ahead. Question display this is A 10097 94 up to all terms which are positive. Good question. Comparative meaning here, a little maths may be required. You will show it without maths. We will show you with maths also. Now aWhat happens friend, as I write 100 9794, can you tell the next term? Yes, it is clearly visible friend 3 97 97 3 94 If you do 3, then the next number will come to me. If you do 91 91 3, you will get the offcourse 88. Okay, so it will continue like this, but how many such terms do I have to print, I have to print all those terms, up to all terms, up to the end terms.
