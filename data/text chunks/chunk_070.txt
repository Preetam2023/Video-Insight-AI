uppose we take the example of a b then inside it the things on which the operation is performed i.e. the thing which is getting plus, the thing which is being multiplied and divided, as a reminder of which we are taking out questions, we call them operants.Here a will become our operand one b will become our operand two in the same way if there was any other statement like a b c added b d then here a b c d we have four operands and the second term which we need to learn is operator operator what is the symbol which tells what operation is going to be performed like here our operator is our plus operator can be our plus operator here minus could be performing subtraction would be performing then ourThe minus would have become our operator. If we were multiplying then the asterisk would have become our operator. If we were dividing then we would call this slash our operator.
