vel. In the language of programming, this is called Recurse Tree. We need to go into so much detail. No, even the word Recurse Tree is not used in C programming.We need to remember what happens but if we have to understand recovery from a diagram, what have we done? We have understood recovery from boxes, we have understood recovery from code, we have understood recovery from maths and now we have understood recovery from diagram, so all the four directions ways of understanding recovery have been discussed and in the most lovely way, in the best way, I have tried very hard to understand recovery very well.If I can sit in it, we have done that thing very well. Now let s move on to the next question. The next question tells us that we have to do the factorial of n. So just like we had calculated the sum of n, similarly the factorial of n says that now before doing the recognition, we have to use a paper pen a little bit and a little bit of our brain.
