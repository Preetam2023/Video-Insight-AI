nction calls it directly or the main function calls it.Indirectly calls through some other function. Now if we analyze it once, then save it and compile it once and run it. Now, no matter what nationality I enter, for me first of all Namaste was called because what happened was that the main function first called Namaste, what did Namaste do? It printed Namaste, after that it called the second function, after that the second function closed it.If it is printed then first of all Namaste will be printed, after that our second greeting will be printed, so in this way, what does the control do? It goes from the main function to the second function, then from the second function to the third function and then comes back inside the main. Now the next property which we will talk about is There can be multiple functions in a program, which we have already seen, we have already made two functions. You can put as many buttons as you want inside your remote, similarly in your C program.
