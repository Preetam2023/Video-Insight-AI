added to 4320 so it becomes 432 1 then r e r 10 Problem 43 210 n n ba 10 Now the value of n is zero.You can fix the code like I told you how after the loop ends in the code, if I like when the loop ends, after this we can write simple because there is only one zero extra, then divide r by 10, we can do this work off course, here it is okay, this will do a very good job, but apart from this, do we have any other work around, I say, we have a small work around, if I replace this with thisOkay, that is, look here in the code, we come into the code, remove the line with r r and 10 by using commandIn the beginning there was zero, so 0 10 is coming out first, so it is remaining zero, okay, so one zero is left for us, always the rest, you complete it once yourself, like I have brought this code here, now we have to swap both of them, just swap these two lines, we have to write one above the other, one below the other, our code will be absolutely correct. Let s move towards the next question.
