is i 1. This statement is the initialization statement which comes here.Our condition can be second. The condition tells us when to end this for loop, that is, when our work will be completed, like here we had written that int, we take a variable i whose value we start from one and in every task, inside our for loop, inside the for loop, we will be printing here what Hello World and here instead of the condition, we will write the condition in which our loop should run, then we want our loop to run then.Then run when the value of our i is less than equal to 5, then if our less than 5 is 5 or equal to 5 then you keep printing hello world and as soon as the greater than 5 becomes 5, do not print hello world anymore. Because we have printed it five times and in the updation statement, we write our variables or if we are going to do any updation in the loop, like here we can write i i 1. Every time we will increase the value of i by one.
