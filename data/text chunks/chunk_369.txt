ite the name of a variable, meaning end is the address of, then we get the address of that variable. Now what is the type of address? Percentage p, then we will print the address. In the next line, we have written ptr . Now the pointer will also do the same, if M is the percentage edge, we will get it.If we give an address then the pointer also gives us an address so the percentage p in that too and if we want to write the address of the pointer i.e. the pointer will also have an address like if the edge had an address then we have stored the address of the edge in the pointer but the pointer is also standing on some land and the pointer also has its own plot so it will also have an address. If we have to get that address printed then for thatWe will also use percentage p, that s why if we specify it here, then what we have done is that we have created a variable which has 22 inside it and have stored the address of that variable inside a pointer.
