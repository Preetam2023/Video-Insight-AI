in this way our get s, put s and f gates work. The next thing we will learn is a very learned thing. Just as our arrays were points, similarly our strings are also points because there is a very logical answer behind it. If array is a pointer then what is a string also?String is also a character array, so ultimately it is also a pointer. Very easy thing, like what we used to do for our array, we called an int. We made it an array, we can make it like this, we will write the size in it or we can make it like this, similarly, we can make our string with array notation and also with pointer notation, if we have to make the string with pointer notation, then what to do for it, for this we will simply write character pointer and then write atr or whatever we want to name our string and after that our entire string, then it stores the string in the memory and theThe assigned address is stored in the character pointer SDR, so this Hello World, our entire Hello World will be stored inside our
