on is our practical code. We have been given this code. There should have been a question mark here. Now here we have been given a code in which intSo we will printWrite down T, write down 1, write down 2, all these values become ours. We will use this thing here. First of all, you stop and guess once, logically guess yourself, don t guess. Basically, I would say analyze what should be the answer to this. Out of these three, let s think of answers out of these three. Put the region yourself and if it doesn t come or even if it has come, then after that you have to check the region.First of all, let s execute it and see what its output is going to be. We have already written intFor us x 1. Now why is this printed because x is equal to 2. This happened because if we have to check thatAnd we put P one there, now inside this if condition, the value ofSo now it will be printed x 1. If we want to print x then it is not one and its value has already been written.
