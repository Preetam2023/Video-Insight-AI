another, if there are 100 elements inside the array, then we have to move them one after the other. If we want to print a value, then how to do it? First of all, now we have learned something new that Er is a pointer and we have also learned that we can plus or minus the pointer value, so simply what will we do, we will run a loop, after running the loop, if our values, if our pointer is at zero in the beginning, then by adding plus plus to it, we will take it to the end and in the same way, minus minus.We can also bring it back while doing and here we will get our pointer printed from row to n. How to do it. Suppose you have stored the Aadhaar card values of 10 people. First of all, if we have to access things i.e. Scan F or Print F for input output, let us understand it with an example. Suppose you have created an array named Aadhaar which stores the Aadhaar cards of 10 people.
