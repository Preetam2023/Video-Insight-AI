?Whatever the array is, it is our pointer, so the call is made by reference from the pointer itself. Secondly, we saw that when we called reverse, reverse reversed our array, but even inside the main function, the array got reversed, so this shows that whenever we pass the array inside the function, it is always called by reference. So, you will give the array to some other function and then if that function makes some changes in it, then those changes will remain with you.They will also be reflected, that is why the values of the arrays have to be changed very carefully inside any function because they will also be reflected inside the calling function. Now the next question which we will talk about is how to write a program to store the first and fobo numbers.
