ogram will be successfully compiled. This time, if we enter 15, then only thank you will be printed. Nothing else will be printed because there is no else, only this statement will be true or not, that will be checked, so in this way ourIf Else works, now there is a special thing inside If Else. If we have written multiple statements inside If or else, then we have to put curly braces, but these curly braces are not compulsory. If we have to write only one statement, like in the case of If, we have to write only one statement. In the case of Else, we have to write the same statement. Thank you, the last one, we remove it from here for now and weIf you save then this program will be getting compiled and running even without curly braces. If you enter 23 then you will see that adult has been printed and no error has come. So if we have a statement then we can work without curly braces also.
