re. Look, bracket bracket. Okay, while i 10. Again an equal to is written. So let s go line by line. The value of i is box nothing. Box is not created. Value is not entered. Now it is written i 10.I have put 10, okay, as long as the value of i is 10 and now it is 10, as long as i is given 10, that is, it is written here print f b n i. Okay, so it comes directly to the output. When we are talking about printing, if n is put, then i will be printed on the next line. If i is printed, then 10 will be printed. i i 1, so the value of i has become 11. Okay, the value of i has become 11, but coming back here, we will come back here.E equal to 10 is not equal to two is equal to two so here we put the assigned value back to 10 and always again we will keep going inside the loop and keep printing 10 only then our output will be 10 10 10 this will never end again resulting in infa loop okay so keep in mind whenever such things happen then infa loop type of type becomes our unless end.
