then called it. The value we passed to our print table number n is called argument or our parameter. After that, what did the print table do with number n? Took this number n, we will call it parameter or our formal parameter, then he got his table printed according to that number. In this way, what does our function do? It takes a value and returns the value. In this case it did not return anything. In this case it returned an integer value. Now let us learn some differences. We will learn the differences. This is a very important question between argument and parameter. What will many interviewers say and ask you?What are the differences between argument and parameter or is this such a classical question. When I studied C in my first semester, this question came again and again in my mid semester and end semester that write the differences between the two. I still remember that question of number three and there was one number for each point, so you can write different points also.
