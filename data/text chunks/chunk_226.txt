of series, I had to keep an extra variable along with the I variable which is available in the loop. Here we will have to keep slightly different variables. Pay attention to the fact that by using those variables, we can always update all the things. Okay, let me try to explain to you how II can form my series, I will explain the algorithm a bit here, then try the code yourself, but then I will get the code done myself, very good, tell me one thing friend, what will I take three variables all the time, ABC or AB even, if I take a variable A, I give its value one, I take variable B, I give its value one, and I give a Weble variable, even its value, I give a, P, B, okay and II run a loop in it again and again and later on I will change one more thing, let me explain to you, see if I do something like this, let s bring it here a little, A Eve, we have given the first term because we will have to give Y, we have also given the second term, now I give that the sum will be Aps B, that is, th
