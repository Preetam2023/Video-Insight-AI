s, so we can declare a new variable aa again, which we did.The value of i is initialized with n i.e. if n is ti then i will be three in the beginning. n5 will be n5 in the beginning then our condition statement is this until i 1 i is minus minus and after that we are printing i. So we save it and run. So this time if we have given three then first of all the sum will be printed on six, after that from three to one in reverse count means reverse.All our numbers in the order will be printed to us. Now all this work is done, what we did in two for loops, we could have done the same in a single for loop, how can we do it in common doubt and here what we do is create another new variable j n, so in this way we can initialize multiple variables inside the for loop, so i 1 and j n. Now here i e equ n until end and ourAs long as j is greater than equal to 1 and every time we are doing plus plus to i then we will make j minus minus and get it printed every time.
