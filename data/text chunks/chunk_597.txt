int will come structure student and in place of a i.e. in the name of the variable, we will have s1. So if we have to pass on the function as a parameter, suppose we have created a structure student with the name s1.From inside the main function, now I have to call if print info, then inside print info I can simply write s1, so that s1 will go to this function of mine, so now let s write a function to do the same thing, here we will write void print info and then we will write type struct student s1. Now if instead of writing here, we had written this same line above and got it saved, then we would have got an error. The error would have come becauseWe have not yet defined the student. What the compiler does is that it starts line by line from the top. First it read this line and then read this line. Here it got confused that integer is a float character.
