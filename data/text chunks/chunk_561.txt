appen because the character has been found here and if it is not found, then nothing has to be done. All the checks have to be done and if the loop is over and the return has not been made yet, then at the end we will have to print thatIf the character is not present then we will print it here. Then we will be returning it from here. We are checking the character one by one whether it is equal to the string or not. After that, if any character of the string is found anywhere then we will print it is present and will get it returned from there. If it is not found then we have to write at the end that the character is not present. Let us save and run this in the main function.Inside also, let s create a string of our character. Suppose we have created a string, our college character seach which we want to send is E in the beginning and we will call check character F R E here on C.
