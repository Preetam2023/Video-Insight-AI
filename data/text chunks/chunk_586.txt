ll write the name of our structure i.e. data type, then the name of our variable and the right side.We will write all our three values inside , like if we want to write name, then name is written first, then roll number, then our CGPA. If we talk about student s2, then for that also we have written name first, then roll number, then CGPA. Now if we write row inside the parentheses on the right side, it means that all the three values for s3 will be null values, meaning zero will go to all automatically, so here we are declaring but automatically.Zero will be assigned to them, then the advantage of initializing it in a single line is that you do not have to write four different lines. First, what do you do, declare s1, then make s1 roll number, then make s1 CGPA, but now we are able to do all these things in a single line.
