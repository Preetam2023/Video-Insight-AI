cause the star has to be always kept with the pointer because now what is happening is this pointer.Dot is taking the roll and after that we are applying star operator in it but first we have to apply star operator with the pointer and then we have to take the dot roll number of it, so always remember this format that whenever there is a star pointer, for structures it means a pointer which is pointing towards the structure, then it has to be put in parentheses first and then we have to use dot operator. Next let s see one of our arrow operators. The structures that we have talked about till now are structures.What do we do inside s1 roll number or s1 name and if we have to write the same format in the pointer then we will write star ptr dot roll number or star ptr name but if we follow this pointer format then it gets too complicated then instead of this dot format we can use arrow operator i.e.
