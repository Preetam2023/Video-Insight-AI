ppose you want to take 14 bytes of memory, then what will happen for you, 14 bytes will be reserved. Now what can you do in this, within 12 bytes, you can store four integers and twoYou can store two characters inside a byte, but I had to store only five integers in this memory, that is why I took a memory which is a multiple of an integer, that is why 5 multiplied by 4 is 20 bytes of memory. Malak will bring it to me. Actually, he has given me a pointer to this memory whose type is void, so it is a void type pointer, but I wanted an integer type pointer, that is why I used it here.This has been typecast and for this typecast, we write star int and not int star, so I have got memory of int star type, in which memory I have 20 bytes, that is, I can store five integers in it and I have stored this entire pointer in this variable ptr. Now if we have to access this memory, then we will access it in the form of ptr. Also, to use the Malak, we have to add a std ae bd a above.
