was this in which the last one was coming 112, after that if we did PTR plus plus then it came 116.It increased by four, after that when we changed it to minus, it came back to 112, that is, it came to the original memory location, because if we did minus again, then it has to be less than the size of an integer, that is, it is reduced by four bytes, so this is how our decrement and increment operators work. Let s take the second case inside the points. What is happening in the second case? We have created a floating variable, price inside which we have stored 20.00. Now what did we do?Made ptr point towards price and then made ptr plus plus, so this time when we will make pointer e equal to pointer pw, the size of this float will be the bytes of our float, so it will be increment and decrement according to the size of the float. Once we code this also, we will write here float price e equal to 100. Now this pointer which is making the price point, first we will use the pointer.
