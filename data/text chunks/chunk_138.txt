everyone and now we are going to start with our third chapter which is named Conditional Statements. Conditional statements are very important in C and this is ourNow we are doing the basis of programming form, before reading the conditional statements, let us see some real life examples of them, like suppose we have a character given to us like M for Monday, T for Tuesday or A W for Wednesday, then in this way we have to take the character and according to whatever character, whatever day it is, we have to get it printed or apart from this, we get a mark sheet inside the school, in which what happens is that we are given some grades, like if yourIf you have got 90 plus, you would have been given A plus plus, in 80 to 90 you would have been given a plus, in 70 to 80 you would have been given A, in 60 to 70 you would have been given B. If the grading system is in this way, then if we have to write the entire grading system in the form of code, then we will need conditional statements.
