of all, if we give one column n, then nothing will be written on the first line. Then we printed x. If the value of x is zero, then zero is printed. Now we go back to the loop whileYou can also see by coding once, just by coding, see here, if I give it ev, then write the friend, remove this thing here, whileWhat have you given to me in the output? Main function intI have told you this thing, we call them increment and decrement operators. Okay and to be very specific. If I writeP 1 and minus minOur post increment post and we call it pre increment, let me explain to you the meaning of pre increment. Whenever I print this thing inside my code, we come here and talk about post and pre increment, then we solve that question. Okay, so post pred c is okay, here we write sh include th, why is it coming, is include add h okay AD funt main function, then we will write return here.
