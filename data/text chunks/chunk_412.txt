l create a function here which will take two numbers a and b and will calculate the sum of both i.e. a b will calculate the product a b and will calculate the average a b 2 will return three values to the main function and what we have learned is that there is only one value returned from the function but whenever a situation comes to return multiple values, then use the points there.Points come in the form of a save. Let s write its solution once and see how the points are useful in the situation. First of all, inside the main function, we will create two variables. The first variable is A. We take A. The second variable is BB. We take the value of B. Now let s create a function. Void does work. It is doing some work for us, meaning someone is doing calculations. In this we will take two values int A.
