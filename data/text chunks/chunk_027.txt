with love. Let s do this so that you can understand all the things. Come here, let s see this code. Friend, we have written this code here. Int i 1, this, these, these, all are fine. Let s do a dry run again. First of all, we have this box which you say, I told you that it runs only once, so we have a box named i in which our one value has been inserted. We have given the condition that i should be less than 10 or 10.Less than 10 Lane equal to 10 means either 10 or less than 10 is fine and which is our last condition i i 2 Here it is different Let s talk about it, what three steps did I tell you, I hope you remember, first of all the box is made that is a different thing. If any thing comes inside the loop, then our step is this.
