type nor String type data type. Both of these do not exist in C because C came first i.e. C in 1970.After that, C came, after that Java came, after that JavaScript came, so C is our very old language, that is why there are many such things in it like objects and classes which are missing, so these are the concepts for which we have to learn other languages later, so out of all these data types, we will write down some of the important day data types and we have to remember only them right now.If it is not needed then let s remove all the already written things in our code and here we will talk about three data types. The first data type is our int. What does int store? Int stores the values i.e. the values which are our whole can be either positive or negative like 1 becomes 2 becomes 5 becomes 1 becomes 0.
