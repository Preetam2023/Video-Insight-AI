In this way the president remains, there is no need to remember this also, the major things which have to be remembered in this are these.The note will be done first, relational comes on top, logical comes below, so we will keep it in this manner, rest whenever you have to refer in the calculation, you can go and refer to these same notes. Now after this We read the type of the one and operator. This is a very easy operator. The easiest operator which is going to be our assignment operator is to assign.
