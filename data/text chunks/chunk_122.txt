lot of people are using while loop. We read the while loop first and then read the while loop first. From the for loop, whom should I give a preference to?For loop is much easier, in it all the things are already given. In the while loop, there are many things similar to the for loop, but you will see and notice the difference. What used to happen in the for loop, my friend, first of all, here I used to be the initialization like i 1, then my condition also used to be, let s say i takes 10, then ours used to be i. P. Okay and the whole loop used to run inside whereas in the while loop, what happens is that the initialization is not here.This happens before the wide loop, as I had shown you in the for loop also, do you remember when I had just written this and had entered it above, okay, in this we have taken out the entire initial statement in the while loop, which is the second and third thing in the while loop.
