e.I would like to write 99 marks here which came after my lot of hard work in 8th class in Sanskrit. Now finally let s print our percentage percentage e percentage d and call our calculate percentage function in which we will pass the marks of science, marks of maths and marks of Sanskrit and save it. We created a calculate percentage function in which we took the marks of all the three subjects and returned the percentage in this function.Here we have defined the marks of all the three subjects, we declared them inside the main function and we called our function, now after opening a new terminal window, first compile and run, the percentage is 970. Actually, we did not have to multiply it by 100 because if we are already calculating the marks from 100, then the percentage will be 97. So if you want to calculate the marks in this way, thenAlso of your college, you can make a function, you can calculate your percentage by adding all the marks you are getting in it.
