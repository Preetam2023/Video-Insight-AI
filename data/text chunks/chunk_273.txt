We have come to the main function of the code.What did you do, if you call print hello, then all the rest of the code will stop for now, like people who have to walk, if they can go in front of the traffic, then there is a similar scene, here this function will stop completely and will call print hello, now the entire code of print hello will be run here, what does print hello do, does it print hello, we have printed hello on our screen, after that we will go back inside the main function.In the main function, we will start from where we had last ended i.e. we had called print hello, then we will start from here, this call is over, then we will call print good bye, then we will reach print good bye, then we will print good bye, then it will come to our console, after that we will come back inside the main.
