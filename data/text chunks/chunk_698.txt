equal to five integers from a calc and then get the user to input the values of those five integers. So, already a lot of the work has been done, first we created an integer pointer and then entered five size integers in it.The memory that has been allocated has been input to five integers and in fact now we have got them output as well, so if we write five here then our numbers will come to us, let s run it and enter five numbers 1 3 5 7 9 then the numbers will be printed and come to us next. The question is, allocate memory to store the first five odd numbers and then allocate memory to store the first six even numbers, that is, we have to take memory to store the first five odd numbers, out of which five we will have 1 3 5 7 and nine stored. After that, this memory has to be reallocated, that is, it has to be used again. First of all, it has to be made of six sizes because we will store six numbers in it, after that the first six even numbers will be stored in it.
