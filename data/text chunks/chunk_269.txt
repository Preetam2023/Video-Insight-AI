that Hello is printed three times. Now we can get the work done by our function any number of times. Now here we have seen a very simple example, what it does is just write a print statement, but inside this function, we can write any number of lines like 10, 20, 25 and we will not have to repeat those lines again and again inside our main function.We will have to write only the name of our function there, so in this way the reusability of our code increases, we do not have to write many lines, our code becomes small and is very systemic because every chunk which should do the work tells us the name of our function, so the programming in this way becomes very simple. We may not see its benefit yet, but when we go to write big codes inside companies, there are thousands of lines of code there.If there are functions there, they help us a lot. Now inside this function, we can print anything. Suppose we are getting it printed. Apart from this, my name is Shata and the next line.
