of all let s make character C which is going to read all the values, now inside C is the first one.Let s get the first character read. How will we get the first character read? F gate C will put F ptr inside it. So by putting F ptr inside F gate C, we will read our character and store it in a variable named C. After this, what will we do? We put a while loop. Why while loop because we have to read the characters one by one in the form of a loop again and again, like if we go inside the test, then first of all we will read t.Then we will read H, then we will read I, then we will read A, then this is the space, we will be reading it, then again I will be reading A in this way, the whole string of words will be affected, here the paragraph would have been completed, you have google2, percentage C, the same character which we have just read and read it again, that is, inside the stitch, now we will take the new value f from gut s inside it, f ptr and finally we will print the next line.
