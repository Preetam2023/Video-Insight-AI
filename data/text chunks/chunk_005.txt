r or doing anything.It is always tried that we should reduce it so that it does not get complicated. Okay, when you start doing a lot of work on a massive level in the computer, then no matter how good your computer is, you will always want to be able to do all the things efficiently. Okay, so we use this principle which is dry. Now let s come straight to the code and see what are these loops, because there are going to be a lot of questions, it is going to be a very big lecture.There is going to be a bigger lecture than L, so there can be two lectures, so let s do one thing, create a new folder, which we will name here. I don t know why this is happening inside E. Ifs, we close E. E. Fels. We go to C programming here and create another folder. It is being created back in A. E.F.L.S. Come on friend, no problem, let s do one thing. We go to our desktop and here we create a folder with the name of New Folder Loops.
