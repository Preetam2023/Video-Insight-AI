n lower case, we have capital A. Special characters also come, like we have hash, we have M percent.Our Aest Risk has come or apart from this, our T Rate has come, then all the characters like this together form our character constants and one thing has to be noted here that the character constants are there, the value of this capital a will always remain capital a, it will not get slashed and whenever character constants have to be written inside the code, then we write them inside single codes, that is, whenever we write any character constant in the code, then it is there.Now we will have to put single codes. Now the next topic we will talk about is keywords. Like there are some words inside the dictionary. Every word has its own fixed meaning, it cannot be changed. Similarly, every programming language has its own dictionary.
