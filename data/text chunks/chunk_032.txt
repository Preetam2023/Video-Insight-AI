itialization box, it is okay here, not one important, what is our point, very like you are one here.You must be understanding the thing, inside this code, I told you that it is printed five times, right? What was happening at the end of the box of I, there were 11 values inside it which were bigger than 10, so tell me one thing, if there is a loop outside the loop, come out of the loop again and now once I print the value of I, see, I can print A and not the value, let s see once, okay see this amazing thing, you say come.If the value was 11, then 11 should be printed here but it will not happen, look, I will run, an error will come, an error has come, it means use of undeclared identification. Making a box, I have already made a box. Here we have a concept. Scope is okay, what is the concept? Here I write the scope of the variable. We will talk about it in the functions which will be our next lecture or the next lecture.
