he factorial of 5 is 120, this is also correct. If we calculate the factorial of 6 then that is 720. Now suppose we are evil minded and we want to enter 50, then why will we cry because the final factorialThat number has exceeded, this data type could not be stored inside it, hence, do not test with big numbers. We can test with small numbers. The next question which we will talk about is print the reverse of a table for a number n, that is, the user will give us this number n. For this, we have to print the table but do not print the table directly. We have to do it in the reverse order, like the user has given n 2, then we will print 20 then 18 16 14 12 10 8 6.4 2 In this manner, if we want to print the table in the reverse order, then nothing, earlier what we used to do was write 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4. This time we will start with 2 10 and then 2 9 2 8. And in this way, this is what it is, this will become our iter for our loop and every time we will decrease the value i.e. i minus minus.
