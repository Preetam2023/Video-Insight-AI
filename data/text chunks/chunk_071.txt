risk would have become our operator. If we were dividing then we would call this slash our operator. So, those instructions inside s which have some operands inside them, some are operators, we call them Arithmetic instructions. Now, what can be the examples of Arithmetic instructions, we can write them like ifWe define a new variable int a 1 and b 2 and here we create a new Let s define the variable sum a b so here it is an arithmetic method, a and b are operands plus is our operator and sum is our new variable inside which our value is assigned i.e. it gets stored, similarly we can create int multiply a b b Now here multiply is a variable inside which the value of a b is stored, now whenever we go into arithmetic.Talking about instructions, one special thing we have to note is that whenever we perform any arithmetic operation on a single variable on the left hand side, all of them go to our right hand side i.e. a b c ba d.
