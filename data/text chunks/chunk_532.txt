ritten just this much, then once we run the program, we get an error and the program never executes. Because when we declared the first string without a size, it took the size equal to it.In which 1 2 3 4 5 6 So the size of the first string is currently six. We cannot fit the world inside the six, but when we have given the size of the first string as 100, then now it means hello, it is inside it, after that, there is also some free space lying inside it, so inside that we can add the world by bringing it, so whenever we have to create a problem, we have to ensure that we have some free space inside the first string, inside which the second string can come and join. Next LibraryThe function we will talk about is ATR CMP. Here by mistake CPM is written. This is CM. This is for string comparison. So we can also compare the strings whether one string is equal or not equal to the other string. In fact we can also compare whether one string is smaller or bigger than the other string.
