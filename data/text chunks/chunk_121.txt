ition inside it whether that condition is true or false. So there we use these expressions the most.Must have been, now here we have a question that within a single expression we can also write some arithmetic operators. In a single expression like arithmetic operators we can write a b c d e in this way and inside the single expression we can also compare them i.e. this value is greater than 4 3 5. In this way we can then end the value 4 2 so we can write an expression so long.Within which our relational operators will be coming, then how is the president decided in them, then they also have their own operator president order in which there is a priority wise president, the highest president is given to us, wherever the not operator comes, first of all we have to do not, after that all the other things have to be done, after that multiply divide module, then plus minus comes, then our relational operators come again.
