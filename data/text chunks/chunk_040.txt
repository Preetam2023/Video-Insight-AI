gh I had asked another question, here s why this is happening. Let s try dry running this code once. Then you will understand everything very well and after that, we will not do so much dry run. No, because now we have grown a bit in coding, I will show you the dry run because it wastes a lot of time and the lecture becomes very long. If you look here, in this code.First, what is happening, if I say print F and hello world instead of this, I write ok or hello inside, then you know how many times this hello will be printed from one to 100 and in jump of one key, this is also called jump, we call it increment, ok, first i was 2, if it went till 100 then this loop will run 100 times. Okay, we know that the loop will run 100 times, but what is written inside, look at it once.
