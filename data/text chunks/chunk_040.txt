ne comment, so we are writing some things on our multiple lines and this is all part of the comment. Now if we remove this then this is an English thing, it will give us an error because it is not actually understood by C. The compiler is not able to understand what it means. What is this actually written?That is why that part which did not make sense for the compiler, we always write it in the comments, like in big companies, whenever you start writing code, the code becomes so many thousands of lines of code that it becomes difficult to understand, that is why to help other programmers, we write comments inside our code to tell them which part of the code performs what function. Now the next topic which we will study is the output whenever weInput output is a very essential part of programming. First of all we will learn how to show the output in C. After that we will learn how we take input in C.
