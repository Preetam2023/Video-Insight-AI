ension. Two square brackets means it has two dimensions and how will we define it on the right side. The outer square brackets will tell how much total data is stored inside. One square bracket means one array, the other square.The meaning of bracket is the second array, the elements in the first array are one and two, the second array is three and four, so this array will actually be formed. Now how to visualize it inside the memory, there are two ways, the first way is that we should visualize it in such a way that our one is stored here, two is here, three is here, then this is our array, this location inside this will be called 0 0, this will be called 01.If we say 10 and call it one one, then we can imagine it like a matrix.
