we have a new data type in which we can store three different values together and how to create it. So, we have defined our data type as follows.Once we have to write that our data type will look something like this, after that if we have to use the data type then just like we used to use integer int n 5, in the same way here we have to write structure student, this is our data type student structure, after that in place of n we have s1 and now if we have to access different different parameters for s1 i.e. for student, like for name we will write s1, for name roll number we will write s1.For roll number and CGPA, we will write s1 cp7 5, so in this way we will be declaring it, using it and then also accessing the parameters inside it. Now let s actually create a structure inside the code and see how it is written. First of all we will write struct keyword struct, after that we will write student as the name of our structure.
