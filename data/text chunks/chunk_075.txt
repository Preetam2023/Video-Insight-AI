is, I have made a very small mistake. 103 3n was there, then see why my answer came wrong. Leave it.Sometimes I am a teacher of maths whereas I am ok, no problem, here my next step will be 3n e 103 100 otherwise n e 103 Ba 3 then 103 div Ba 3, how much is it? Our 102 is exactly divisible by 3 by 4 so this is our 34.3 333 so basically n is lesson 34.3 soThe n that can be maximum will be my 34. If I talk about it, you understand my point, 34 is that number, but man, I am not enjoying maths here, man, I am not enjoying it, brother, I don t even know maths, which you have shown here by using a strange formula.
