bsolutely correct because all the variables are defined and on the left side we have written only a. Now what other expressions can there be? Like what do we write in math? If we have to multiply two numbers then we write x 2 3. We put a dot there or 2 3. This is also seen like multiplication but this same thing is not valid inside c. If you write a c inside c, it will not be seen like.This will be seen as an error. What can be its example, like we write int d bc c, then what will be stored inside a, b will be divided by c and whatever amount we get will be stored inside a. At the same time, the invalid expression can be that at some places we have seen that if we have to write c to the power of b, then how do we write b c? This expression is wrong, inside c we have power inside c.
