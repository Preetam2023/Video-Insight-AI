the verbal character appears then do plus plus. If it does not appear then leave it and move ahead. This is going to be a simple method. Let s create a function for this also. We have created many functions. Inside this code, do not get confused that we are talking about the latest function which we are discussing. In fact, what do I do? Rest of the gist of the code is not there.I comment it out for simplicity so that we know what we are talking about. I also comment it out int count wobbles. Inside this we will be passing our string int count vals character SR. Inside this we will have string. Let s take a variable count which will start from row. Now let s run a loop in which int will initialize with i until our string of i is not equal to null.character and now let s do i p then we will compare every time i.e.
