e, if we have to interchange the values of two variables, then we will bring a third empty variable. Let us assume that the third empty variable is called temporary variable, that is, we have given it a name, t is temporary, it is empty. Now, first of all, what will we do, will we put the value of a in the value of t or the value of b, we can do anything, that means the value of a has been stored in t, now the value of a is stored in t.Inside we will put the value of b and inside b we will put the value of t, then either we can write this or if we write in this way, both of them are correct. Vergus basic point is this, either empty a first or empty b, then in that way we will be able to swap both the values, so we are going to write two verges, call by value in one of spring, call by reference in the other, let s see which one is correct, first try spring.Let s call by values, create a function void swap. There will be two variables inside it, int A and int B.
