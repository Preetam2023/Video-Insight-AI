the value of factorial does not multiply but increases as if there is very little change in the sum. If you add five to 10 then the value will be just 15 which is a small value but if you multiply 10 with five then the value will become 50, hence if the factorial is there then it increases very fast i.e. almost exponentially, that is why your int isIf you are making a factorial of this integer data type, then there will be multiple numbers inside it. There will be less number of numbers which you will be able to store factorial i.e. if you give a big number in it like you want to calculate 50 factorial then in that case int will be very small so to store it you will have to use big data types and in some cases the factorial will become so big that no number data type will be able to store it, so there are different ways to do it, that is in your competitive programming or extreme DSA side.
