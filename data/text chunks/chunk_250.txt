one and see what it means. I enter enter base to power and then the answer is 2 to the power 1 is 2. Okay, 2 to the power 0. What happens if I do enter base to power 0 2.To the power 0 is one. Yes, so this is our code is always working. How come, what is happening in the case of 2 rate power 0, if b is 0 then this loop is not running and we had initialized the power to one, already one answer is coming so ok you can try other things here, if I write power of 3 is 5 then 243 is coming, see 243 is coming so of course all these things are working for us.It will work with all the numbers, not only with two, because our code is absolutely correct here, only we have not seen two in general.
