l be printed to us. Now the computer will do the work which I could not do and will give it to us i.e. it will print the table of 42 and give it to me. So the whole table of 42 has been printed to us very quickly. So in this way, if we have to get the table of any number printed then we can get it printed with the help of C on our screen.On top of this, whenever math calculations are being done and the calculator is not around and the brain is not able to operate on its own, it would take us out, that is, it would make us exit from the entire block that was running, because of that, the condition of all the cases would not be turned on, that is why we have written break statement i.e. break wherever it is, its main meaning is that we have to exit the loop, now wherever we have to exit from the loop, we should write break like for.Example, if we have written a code, we have written a for loop inside which we are printing the numbers from one to five. for int i 1 i less equt 5 a p plus.
