, come to the loop and write here FOC D C is okay and off course inside this also we do some things.You will copy and paste the same as factorial. Okay, brother, okay, now the screen is visible better. So, I have taken one number. Follow me. A, you have to make a fine number. Now let s remove all these things. Just for now, I have taken one number. I said bring three variables, int A, put one inside it, then int B, put one inside that too in the box, then write int even, for now, put something in it. Put t or put zero, you can do anything, okay, this should make it easy, now I have to run a loop, so for int, how many times do I have to run the loop, as many times as my number is, okay here there will be a mistake, which we will correct, I am doing it deliberately, from int aa 1 to how many times we are running the loop, let s say we are running the loop n times because the ith number is required, i p p, okay, what are the steps we had to do here, look back, what are the steps.
