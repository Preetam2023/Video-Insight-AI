n it we can write hello C. Let s save it as above.Let s blow away the extra space and run your code. Open the terminal and GCC Hello C will come up and Hello C is printed for us. Now suppose we have to print Hello C again and again. How to print it? Copy this line, paste paste paste. So we have printed Hello C four times. Save it and will run it again here. Now we have Hello C printed. Immediately after that Hello C is printed again in the same manner, it is printed four times.We wanted that if the next line is printed in the next next line, then that next line is always there. Here we have to write one thing, the special thing which is our base n. This base n shows that whatever we had to print in print f will be printed, after that a next line will come. We write the same thing here as base n. Even after this, the next line is needed, after this also the next line is needed and even after this, if the next line is needed then we save it.
