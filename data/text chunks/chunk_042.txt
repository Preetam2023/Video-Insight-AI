very correct, I am writing the space like an underscore, but it is not an underscore, it is a space. Okay, now what happened back inside the loop, we went back inside the loop, but before that, as soon as I printed it.Value is updated i PPS So i i 1 So value of i becomes two Then check whether 200 is less than 100 Exactly go inside print f Aa but now value of a is two You understand this is a very clever use of our power So two is printed Similarly you must have understood friend As soon as two is printed Our value is updated 3 Is it smaller than 300 Yes go inside but printDo it okay, our 4 phase as we can see on the output screen, it has been printed up to 100, okay friend, this is not a very cool thing, I will tell you, friend, print up to 50, print up to 50, show me, friend, okay, print up to 50, you tell me, yes brother, from no to 50, now let s do the next question, think a little in this, next after this I will give homework, I will show it by doing this question.
