at the same time here I reduced the count to three, then I again divided by 10. 19 10 Our one is 1.9 but one is one more, I added four to the count and divided the last one by 10, then the answer will be zero, I am fine and my answer will be five. Now pay attention, what is the condition of termination here, which means to end the loop, I repeat it again and again.How many times am I going to do this work, like I did it five times here, so you can see that as I keep dividing by 10, how many times do I have to divide by 10, until my number becomes zero, until my number becomes zero, now should I do it with a for loop or should I solve it with a wide loop, you may also be thinking, should I solve it with a for loop or a while loop, so I told you one thing whenIf you don t know much, then you can solve it with the while loop, like here I just have to tell you, what is the condition given to me? The condition is something like this, when my number becomes zero, then I have to end the loop
