s matched it with one, then whatever is written next to it, it will do that work and give it to you. So, in this way, you have switched it on, after getting the case matched, then it will do the work and give it to you. Now we write the switch, inside it, we can enter only numbers or characters with whatever variable we have to match, then it checks the cases, here we write some constants likeOne is done, two is done, then we write in this way, case one, case to case. And in terms of character, if we want to do it with character, then case A, case B, we have to write the constant after the case, after that we have to put a colon, then write all your statements, all the statements, in the same way, we will write the next case, whatever the statement is, and at the end, break must be written. The work of the break is to take you out after the case, if it is not the break from the switch.If it happens then all these statements will be executed.
