ion of number three and there was one number for each point, so you can write different points also. Apart from this, there are some other points too but the major ones are the points.Those differences are being covered in this. What are the arguments? What are the values that are passed in the function call? The value we passed inside the function call is called argument. What are the values in function declaration and definition? The value which is written in the declaration and in the definition, we call it parameter. Like inside our code here we have written int a or int n, this is also our parameter and this is also a parameter.And where the call is made where the data type is not written, that is our argument. Now the work of argument is to send value. The work of parameter is to receive value. Argument is also called actual parameter and parameter is also called formal parameter. These are some differences which you can remember a little bit.
