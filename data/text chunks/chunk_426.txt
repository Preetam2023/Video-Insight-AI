run, so first of all we will enter the marks of Physics, then we will enter the marks of Chemistry.If we enter the marks of Maths then in this way the marks of all the three subjects have been stored position wise. In Physics we have stored 97 at zero position, in Chemistry we have stored 98 at the first position and in Maths we have stored 89 at the second position. If we go here that we have declared an array of three and we are accessing 0, one and two and we are going to access if three.Suppose we access three or here we write three that we will store the marks of Math in three, so let s compile it once and run it, we have stored the marks of Physics 97, Chemistry 98 and now like Math, we Suppose we are storing 89, in the same way, our program has aborted, which means it has ended, because an error has occurred and this is an error which is a run time error, meaning the compiler will not be able to check.
