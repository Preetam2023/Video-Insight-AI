it will not be zero it will be array of i Now put in the array of i our second value and array of n Put our first value in i 1, so we have exchanged both these values with each other and this has become our array reverse. Now what will we do, we will get it printed inside the main function, first of all we will call reverse, we will pass the array in it and its size n is the value of n. After that, we will create a function to print our array. A void print array print array for int i 0. We will already write this code.So, I hope that here you will pause the video and this function has to be completed by itself in which we are printing the values of the array A R R of A. Finally, we give a next line, let s do this, we call void here, print the array A R R and F. So first of all reverse the array, call reverse inside the main function, then print the array, save it and run the return of this function.
