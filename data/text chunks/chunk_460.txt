0 0, this will be called 01.If we say 10 and call it one one, then we can imagine it like a matrix. In 11th and 12th, there must be a matrix inside which we had some parts, so here it used to be Row here, one here, two here, row here one, here two , then in the same way, if one is written here, two is written here, three is written here or four is written, then it becomes 0, this becomes 0, and this becomes 10, this is done.There is some system of this type, so here also it means there is something similar inside the memory that we will call it zero zero, this will be called 0 and this will be called 10, this will be called and but how is it actually stored inside the memory, it is stored in this format i.e. first one will come then two will come then three will come then four will come then this zero will become zero this row one this one and this 1 1 Now if we have to accessSo how will we access the elements? If you want to get one array of 0, then it will be this value.
