is less n 1, I can also write this, it will not make any difference, i is less n because if there is any integer smaller than n, then it is this one, right, like see, I run it the same thing.I will write three is a prime number, okay, so this thing is also valid, we can write it in both the ways, like i, e, e, e, 100, we can also write i, e, 10, the thing is the same, so let s come here little by little, let s try to understand the while loop, what happens in the while loop, let s see with some examples, the while loop also, after that we will do it, okay, consider the same question, let me print from one to 10.Like this is our code, what will it do for us, let s take an example here, let s go through the coding and go into the loop, we are going to ask a lot of questions about the Y loop. Okay, so we create Y dot C and here also we write something from the beginning, let s say sorry include std d h int main function return zero, okay and let s try to write our code here.
