one it becomes five. Now we will notice that a is written on the left and a is written on the right. When the same expression is written on the left and right, that is, the same variable is written, then we can make it smaller. How can we make this a a b, we can write a is equal to b.So here plus equal two has replaced equal two a, so in this way, whenever we use the same variable on the left and right side again and again, we can replace equal two with plus equal two, then that operation will be performed like here if we write the statement a b and then check its value then the same output will come to us. Which is now the same thing which we have done.Along with the plus, they can also do the same with multiplication. Here, if you write Ag , multiply equal to two, then what will happen is 4 1, both will be multiplied, then there will be a fur in the output, while if you write Minus , what will happen in the minus? The meaning of this statement is a a b, so a is 1, b is 4, 1 4 3.
