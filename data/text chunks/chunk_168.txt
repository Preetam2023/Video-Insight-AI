ion, let s move ahead, the question is write a program to print the sum of digits of a given number. Well, like last time I had to tell how many digits a number is, if I had saidI am n 1 2 3 4 5 so it is a five digit number, now I have to tell the sum of all these, like ours is technically even, our sum will be 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 p 5, that is, you can see that our 15 should be even, so how do I have to print it. If my n is 99998, then I have to show it as 9 9 9 8. So how will I do it?Friend again, for this, first of all I give you a small hint, please try it yourself, friend, we come to our hint section, look at the hint, hint number one is that here now I will also use the modus operator, both the modus operator and division operator, like last time I used the division operator, okay and hint number two is that if we have 1 2 3 4 5, then 1 2 3 .
