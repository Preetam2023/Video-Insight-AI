ay is to be printed, for two, Tuesday is to be printed, so we could have made them up and down also. Maybe the condition of Tuesday is that if there is two, then Tuesday is printed, it is coming up and if there is one, then Monday is printed, it is coming down. The switch in it does not give an error like we have done here. Dub is there, which comes after F in our characters, but in the case of D, we have it above.The one is below, if we write this Friday also above, then no error will be coming. The second thing is that nested switch means switch inside switch is allowed. We can have inside the switch, we can write our own separate switch inside the switch, like which day is outside, we have made cases for it and consider the case as number three. When the number becomes true, then after that, put another switch and we will put the year which year is going on or will put it.
