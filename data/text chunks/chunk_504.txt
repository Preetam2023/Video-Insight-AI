cause the size is not required. We know that our string will end where the null character will come. If we did not know this in the normal array, then we save it and get it run. So first of all our string first name is printed, after that our string last name is printed, then something like this.From this we can get our string printed character by character. We have to put a loop in it and the special thing that has to be remembered in the loop is that until the null character does not come, the next thing which we will talk about is that our string format has been specified, we have got the string printed in percentage C i.e. character by character and if input has to be taken also, then how will the string take input? We have to take input character by character only, so we do not know anything else but there is a special format in the characters.The specification is percentage s. This format is a specification string in which some value is stored. Now we have to print it.
