ake eight then 5 then 7 then three these are adjacent to two all these are adjacent to two then I should explore which one four so who are adjacent to four three is already over then explore eight who is adjacent to eight five and seven both are visited now explore 7 so this is six now explore three so 10 and 9 so 10 and 9 this is one also this one is also a valid answer then one more I ll start exploration from five from five who are adjacent 2 8 7 and and six now explore two who are adjacent to two 3 and 1 now explore 8 7 is already visited seven everything is visited six nothing is there so everything is visited explore three so 9 and 10 and four so for three 9 10 and four I have visited now explore one nothing is remaining 9 10 4 all are visited so this is also valid so like this you can start from any vertex and you can visit the adjacent in any order so you can form numerous number of valid breadth for search next we will see depth for search now next is depth for search for this
