g. We just want to see that as soon as we have set up our environment, any of our C code runs on it.After opening the file, I am going to write a sample code, then we are going to open a new file inside VS Code, first of all save that new file. Before doing world.con, there are some extensions in VS Code which we have to install so that VS Code can understand which code you are going to run and give you some additional functionalities for that. So below you will be getting the option of extensions. Now to run C, we have toc c extension of p It is a pack, we will have to install it inside our VS code. Once we have installed it, then we will go to the terminal above and open a new terminal. Now I am going to write some commands which are very complex. You are going to write very good advanced level C programs, so don t worry right now that these are going to be complicated, so I wrote some code.
