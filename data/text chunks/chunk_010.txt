don t know the meaning of, but if I write nine in place of this four, then it will come nine times. I know this as much as I can understand right now, it will come nine times, so you must be understanding what is happening, if I write something else instead of this nine, then the thing inside is going to run that many times, clearly one thing, we came to know from here that this thing inside is this thing.I will tell you about Lane Equal 9 later, but this number is defining a lot. If I write 100 here and then run, it will come 100 times. Look, this is too much. Look, I am scrolling right now. Look, it has come 100 times. Look at my right, this stone is rotating, it is printed 100 times, so it is quite an amazing thing that by changing one small thing, if we come back together.Let s do this by changing one small thing and the work is being completed and since I wrote this print F only once, there was no need to write it seven times, so this block is useful for us.
