, it got the entire line printed with us. In this way, whenever we had to take multi word sentences.If we have to take multi word strings then we will use get s and put s. Now get s because it is dangerous and is a little outdated, so in its place there is another function named F Gets.First of all, we enter our string, whatever string we have to enter, then we put the size of the string, maximum number of characters we can input and after that we put the name of our file, now what is the name of this file, what should be put here, forget it for now and in place of the name of this file, we will put STD I A, just this many lines have to be written, this is called standard input, so what is this, why are we writing this, do not pay attention to it right now, just SDD IWhenever you want to use F get S, put A. What does F get S do? It stops when n 1 characters are input and the new line is edited, that is, you will keep writing your entire word as it is.
