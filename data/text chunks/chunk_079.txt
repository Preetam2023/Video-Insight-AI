that the condition should be on I. The condition means that condition when Tata Bye Bye is finished.Let s go to the loop then we write here i p means the value of i will keep increasing by one as soon as the loop ends the first one round of the loop is increased by one the next round is increased by one so what is happening here is first a is printed then look in the output if I come then what is the first work being done first of all our work is getting a printed What is happening is that our value of a is 100 so 100 is printed and there is a space so one space is also printed ours is ok so 100 is printed then our value a a 3 then three is reduced from a so the value of a becomes 97 then as soon as this work is done I said first of all our check is fine but what is the check here one thing that I forgot to tell you before running the loop, we are not inside the loop.
