will return us a reminder of a did ba b, like if you see some examples of this, there are 4 models.2 will return to us 5 modulo 3 will return to us 1 because if we divide four by two then we will get a reminder. If we divide five by three then we will get a reminder. If we do 5 3 then 1 will come to us. Here it gives the module and number so we will get a reminder. In the same way if we divide 12 by 10 then we will get a reminder only two andIf we do 20 module 10, we will get a reminder of zero, so in this way, whenever we have to find out a reminder, we use it by writing an example of our module operator. If we have to print F, an integer value in which we want to print 16 mod 10, then we already know what the answer should come to us. The answer should come to us. Six and it is printed in the answer. We have6 because when we divide 16 by 10 then six will be left. Now the module operator which is there does not work on our float values like if we write here 1.6 1.
