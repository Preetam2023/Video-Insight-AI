nteger but we will write it as float and will be returned. Our value of Fahrenheit will be returned. What will we do inside the main function? We will call inside the main function and pass the convert temperature in it. Let s assume that we have passed row degrees.And from here our Fahrenheit value will be returned to us. Now we will get our Fahrenheit temperature printed as a percentage. Let s save it. We have created a convert temperature function in which we get the temperature value in Celsius and return it. We return the Fahrenheit value and run it. So we have 32 degrees Fahrenheit. We have got it printed. Similarly, if we assume that we have any value in Celsius.We are sending the temperature like we are sending 32 Celsius then it will be converted into Fahrenheit 64 degree. Here we made a small mistake that we have written integer values here as 9 5 so this is also an integer. This is also an integer 9 5.
