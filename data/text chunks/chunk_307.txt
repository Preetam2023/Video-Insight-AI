n. We have double, its return type is power, its name is and it takes two values, double and double. Now here is the automatic integer, we have passed integer n and integer 2. Both these values can be automatically converted into implicit double because double is a big data type, it can be put in a container from small to big.If there is a problem in putting from small to big container, then the compiler can automatically put it from small to big, then it will convert it, but it will not convert its double into integer, that is why we write f here, to print the floating value, the percentage f we have is for the double only, but the floating values are also printed with the percentage f, that is why whenever the double has to be printed, whenever the double has to be scanned.So we will use percentage F. Float automatically comes to us as input.
