henever we are looking at this code, we are constantly seeing a red line at the bottom of the array. This is happening because whenever we pass the 2d array, which is the first dimension.Ours is treated like a pointer, but the second dimension is treated like an actual array in which we need to give the size, so like there is a second array, inside it we have to define our size, which is 10, otherwise this red line will never go. From here, if we do not tell the size, then it gives us an error that there are no compatible types. Now if we run this code, the output we get is something in which the table two key is printed first.This is 2 4 6 8 12 till 20 and after that the three key table is being printed. Lad, we should have printed this in the next line, so here we give a statement print f b a. So first of all the two key table has been printed, then the three key table has been printed and how we printed the tables, by storing them inside a 2d array i.e.
