in normal cases.The process takes place, the first of which is the syntax of the function prototype. What is the meaning of function prototype? This is the line due to which we are telling the C compiler that we are going to write a function. The C compiler should know what things are written inside the program. So with the help of this line i.e. with the help of this prototype, we tell that we are going to declare a function, so it is also called function prototype or function declaration.Now what is the syntax of writing this? The syntax is that this is print hello, this is the name of our function. The name of our function can be anything because it is like the name of a variable, it is user defined, like what does our function do, our function prints hello, we have learned this, that is why we named the function print hello. If it prints the average of two numbers, then we could have named it average or print average.
