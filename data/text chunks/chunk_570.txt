n this also, then now we have to write s1.n If we start writing it normally like we simply wrote s1.n Shraddha So this is the syntax for declaring your string and passing it on as s1.Why is it wrong because inside the strings we had already read that you cannot change the values of the strings which are defined by array notation, you can copy the values in it, you can compare that string, you can use the functions of inbuilt string but you cannot change its value directly from is equal to. Yes, if it was a character pointer then that thing was possible but here this array.It is defined from the notation, that is why here we have to use our string function string copy, for that we include the library above as string da and what we do below is let us do common doubt and write s pva, whom do we want to copy to whom, we will change our name as s1.
