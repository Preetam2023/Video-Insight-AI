ed up, otherwise if I write this, then it will be very wrong because see, if I run and do this here.I am 23, so look at how many times The number is prime, The number is prime, The number is prime, how many times has it come, man, this is not ending as if I put back sl so that you can understand, I will run the code again like I write seven, then see how many times The number is prime has come, So we only had to know about it once, okay and the problem is that if I add the number six here, which is a composite number, then it will also be written The number is composite, The number isIt is necessary to put prime one second back slash and end. Let s run it back once. Suppose the number is six. The number is composite composite prime. Prime is not coming. If so, then the result is coming wrong. So what do we do once? Let s remove this thing. This is the code that I have written, isn t it? From this code, I will be able to know that a number is mine.
