s four because here the associativity rule is applied. Our calculations are done from left to right. Now we have read a lot of things in Arithmik s instruction, we ask some questions from them so that all the things get settled in our mind, then we do practice question four. For these four, we have to solve the questions. First of all, solve them inside our board and see the solutions on our slides.After that we will see what we will do by writing its code and verifying it. Now the first question is that we have 5 2 2 3. Here, the president of both multiply and this multiply is on the top and the minus which we have to do later, the president of both is the same for multiplication, so what will we do, we will apply the left side rule, we will multiply first by 5 2, then in its place we will write 10, the minus is in the middle and then according to the president.
