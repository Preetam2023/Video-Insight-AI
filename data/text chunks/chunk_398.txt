dress of 2000 because we had passed the end number. We will carefully look at this function of ours. Inside the line, we gave the address of the number to the underscore square, so it gave the address of the number.Now whatever changes will happen will be above the address. If we have written star n added by star n then it means that we are accessing this four i.e. it means number and it also means number, so here we have multiplied four with four. Now when we stored it back in star a, it means that we have changed the address itself, so here we have cut the four and stored it as 16, so the address is the same n.The address inside is still 2000 because the plot does not change, the address of the plot is still 2000 but the people living inside it have changed, that is, now we have made 16 out of four.
