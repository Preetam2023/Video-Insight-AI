rite it as if n and 2 is not equal to 0, basically this will also come in the condition of our else. If it is not even then here I am an example in front of you.Let us assume the value of n to be 7 then it will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 So in terms of odd numbers, we will not be able to make all the pairs, one number will be left alone, meaning if I try to make a pair from back, then what will be the difference, one pair is left for us, so let s try to evaluate once what answer will come, this will always give 1 to me, this will always give 1, this will also give 1, okay and it will give only 1000s, so notice that from back it has become 3.Keep Se aside for now, I am keeping it aside for once, I am not adding it, why is it like this? Pay attention to how many pairs are being formed. In the case of 6 , only three pairs are being formed. In the case of 7 , only three pairs will be formed. One is our only lone pair, which is called this, it will be left alone.
