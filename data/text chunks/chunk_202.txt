decrement operator do? It decreases the value i.e. here if we have minus minus then we call it pre.Decrement and there happens aa minus minus so we call it post decrement. Now as an example let s do it here as comment out and comment so the value of aa is one in the beginning. Now here we do i minus minus then what will be the output. We have the output is one and then row i.e. first of all the value of i will be used. If it is one then only one is printed. After that if there is decrement then the value of one will be printed.It will be decremented and when we print the second time we will have row. Now let s comment on this. If we run the second part i.e. minus aa then in this case first of all we will have zero printed because it will be decreased and then it will be printed so here also zero. Here also zero because the first time decrement got converted from one to zero and after that it got printed i.e.
