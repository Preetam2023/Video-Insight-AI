ds our next chapter. Now we are going to start our chapter seven in which we will read about arrays. If we talk about classical definition of array then arrays are collection ofSimilar Data Type Stored at Contiguous Memory Locations Like if we have to store a value in a memory location, then we get it stored with the help of a variable. We take a variable, it reserves a memory location, inside it we store some data and give some name to that memory location which is our variable. If we have to store a lot of data of the same type, suppose here we have an integer.But if we have to store three integers, then we want those three integers to be stored one by one, in which we assume that we are able to store different dates and if we give a collective name to these three, then the structure of this type is called array structure or array. If we look at its definition, it is a collection of similar data types, that is, you can store three ints or five ints.
