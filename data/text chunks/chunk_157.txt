ion of the question mark that it will check, it will question whether your condition is true or not. If your condition returns true then whatever is written here will be executed, otherwise we put this colon after that, it means no.So it will check that if the condition comes true then this will happen otherwise what is written after that i.e. if the condition fails then this remains our syntax, we can check it once by writing an example of ternary operator like we had entered the edge, now how do we execute the ternary operator if our edge is greater than equal to 18, if it is 18 and it is true thing then thatIn this case, we are going to print adult, otherwise we are going to print not adult.
