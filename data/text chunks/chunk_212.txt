I ran.Why did the error come? Friend, I have initialized the sum somewhere. Here the sum is written. Look brother, I have to print my product, so run it. Here it is asking enter number, I say F 120, answer will come, see 120 has come, then I do enter number four, 24 should come, answer 24 has come, then I do enter number six, 720 should come, answer 720 has come, it is working absolutely fine, I am saying enter number 10, answer has come 362 8880, what a big answer is coming, from one to onlyI multiplied by 10, it became a very big number, still okay, so friend, this is our factorial, I hope you are understanding this, once we dry run it so that you can get more clarity, it is not needed but still just for you guys, once we dry run it, this part is enough from here, later we have just printed it. Okay, so friend, look at this code once here.
