for age from the user. If our age is 18 or older than 18, then in that case we have to print adult. If age is older than 13 but younger than 18, in that case whoever is the person is a teenager as per age, then in that caseIf a teenager gets it printed, then this condition is checked and if none of the above two cases are there, then this case will be printed, that is, the child is not above 18, not even between 13 and 18, so obviously he will be below 13, so there is no need to check, just get the child printed, save it and compile and run it. First of all, we enter the age.Five years, in that case child is printed, after that again enter the age. If suppose we have put 16, in this case teenager is printed and again we have put our age 22, then in that case adult is printed. So in this way, what things should be done according to different different conditions, we can do that with the help of FS in our code.
