unction which prints Namaste. Let s create a function for both. Let s remove our old code from here. So first of all we will declare both our functions as void print or just write Namaste andOne is Void Banj, now first of all we will write its definitions Void Namaste, what does it do, it prints Namaste, after that the second function is Void Narur and it will print our French Namaste, so this is the first function, we have this is our second function, now what will we do inside the main, first of all we ask the user for his nationality, print F, enter F for French and I for Indian, now as soon as he enters anything, we enter a character. We will be scanning the percentage C C from the scanner. If our nationality and the character entered are equal then in that case we will print Hello Else. We will be printing Narur. So once we recap the code, above we have made a prototype of the function. First of all, what we did was ask for the nationality and store it in the character set.
