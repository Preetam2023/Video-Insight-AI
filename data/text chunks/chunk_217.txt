all it do while, then there are different cases of do while loop in which using it makes more sense. If we talk about the syntax,If we do then in do while, first of all we write do, that is, here the condition is not checked first, the work is done first, do do, first do the work, first of all, whatever work is done by writing do, we can write our own lines here, then in the last the condition will be checked, that is, we have to keep doing this work as long as the work is done first, then the condition will be checked, then the work will be done, then the condition will be checked, then we will write in the end, then we will write our condition in the parentheses and here weYou must be putting statement terminator because there is no block here, there is parentheses, statement terminator can come after parentheses, hence it has come here, so this is our syntax.
