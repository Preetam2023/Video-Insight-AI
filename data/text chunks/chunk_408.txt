e called the print address, let us look carefully, this is call by value, whenever call is by value.When a copy of a variable is made then this second copy is made, the name of this copy will also be n but its address will be something else because 2000 is already a variable so it will be 21, it will be 2010, its address can be anything, its address can be 5000, can be 10000, so this is a copy of n for our print address function and the value inside it has been copied, so itsOur char has been stored inside also by copying. Now here we are printing the address of this n, so the address of this n that will be printed will be 2000 months, so obviously this address of ours and this address can never be the same in call by value. Yes, if this call was by reference, when we are talking about the same variable, if we are talking about the same memory location, then our addresses would have been the same.Let s verify this too.
