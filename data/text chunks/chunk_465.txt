s. That is also possible.We have learned a lot in complex, so let us practice some of its questions. The first question we will talk about is write a function to count the number of odd numbers in an array, create a function, what will that function do, take an array as a parameter, pass it as an argument, and come inside the array and function and we will count how many odd numbers are there inside that array, like for example, for example, we have aThere is an array inside which some numbers are stored 1 2 3 4 5 and s Now there are odd numbers inside it th and 5 So the count and function that will be returned will be rr Let s write a function for that int count odd In this function we will pass an array of numbers and its size So the size is always to be passed Whenever we are passing an array, let s define the function count odd int array int size endLet s create a variable in which we will store the count. In the beginning, our count is zero, after that we run a loop.
