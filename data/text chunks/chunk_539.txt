nning of the dictionary, the bigger one is at the end of the dictionary. We will talk about it next. Our question is that take a string input from the user using characters, meaning till now, how were we taking input of the string, either we were taking input in the form of percentage s or doing F get S or get S. Now what we have to do is percentage.C means it has to take input character by character. For this, we create a function. We name the function. Instead of creating the input string or in fact function, we create the entire program. Inside our main function, first define a string ATR which can hold 100 characters. Then we will define the character and this is the character which we have to input again and again from the user. We will input this character set and keep adding it inside the string one by one, then a loop will run.
