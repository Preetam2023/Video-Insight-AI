different values If we were storing the information of an employee, we would have named it Student. Suppose, if you were storing the information of an employee, then we would have named it Employee. If we were storing the information of a bank account holder, then we would have given it the name Bank Account in which we would have been storing the account number, IFSC code, bank name, bank address, all these things. So here we have named our structure Student and inside it we have stored three values.The first one is the character array i.e. our string name, after that we have an integer variable named roll number, then a float variable which we named CGPA and we write this entire structure inside the parentheses, meaning all the elements that are going to come inside the structure, we write them inside the parentheses and at the end we put a statement terminator. Usually we forget to include children due to which an error occurs, so we should not forget the statement terminator.
