whenever we are talking about C program, in fact whether we talk about C or Java program, our code.Execution happens, it always starts from the main function. No matter how many lines you write in the program, like we have written something above in the program or we shift our function definition above, it is not that the Namaste function will come up, then first take the Namaste function. It must be getting called. No, the compiler always first goes to the main function for execution and the main function tells what is going to happen now.If we remove these two statements from here, that is, never call Namaste and Banju, then our compiler will never call this Namaste and this second greeting will never be printed on the screen, that is why whenever the execution of the program starts, it starts from the main function. The second thing, a function gets called directly and indirectly from main. Whenever a function is called inside C, that means the function is called.
