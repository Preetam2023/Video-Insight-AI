time, then you have to print all three. Dot name and run it once. So the name has been printed here. Is the syntax coming normal?First you have to write the data type, then you have to write the name of the variable, then the name of the array and then the size of the array and you have to access the values in it only with the same indexed format. Whenever you are assigning values or printing values or using them. Next let s talk about the initialization of structures. What we did is, we declared a structure and then made it a variable. Then we assign the properties of the variable one by one. But instead of using the dot operator again and again, we can assign all the properties together. This is called initializing structures. So in what format do we initialize the structures? First of all, we will write the name of our structure i.e. data type, then the name of our variable and the right side.
