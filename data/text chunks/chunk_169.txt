me I used the division operator, okay and hint number two is that if we have 1 2 3 4 5, then 1 2 3 .We can also write 4 5 like this 5 P 4 3 2 1 I hope this gives you a little idea of what I am going to do, now think a little and try to code, I hope you must have tried, now I am going to tell you my solution here. Okay, so we have seen the hints, let s see the solution, what do we have to do every time? Again, we know that we have to put a loop.What will we do this time, friend, this time we will take a variable, sum and even the sum will be equalized by zero, okay then we will keep adding to the sum again and again, like sir, first of all, we will start adding it in reverse, like A, we have tooth 4, 5, then what will we do, what will we add inside the sum, will we add a number, which digit will be the last number, okay, if you have given any number, then how do you retrieve its last digit?One thing, we have a question, let s say 1 2 3 4 5 n is given, then how do I store five, that is,
