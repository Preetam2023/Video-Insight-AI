then after that, put another switch and we will put the year which year is going on or will put it.Which month of the month is going on, then in that also our case four, suppose it becomes true, then in this way we can put the switch inside the switch and above we had to read that inside the if also we can put the different if, once inside the if i.e. if the condition is one, it becomes true, then the second if which has the condition two, you print it. In this way, we call the if statements as nested nests.Nesting one inside the other, we call it nested if. Let s see an example of this too, like suppose we have to enter a number from the user, then we will print the entered number and then scan it. Now let s write some conditions for the number. First of all, we will check whether our number is positive or negative. Then what will we do for a positive number? We will check if the number is greater than equal to 0 in that case.
