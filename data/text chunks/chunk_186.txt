aying again and again or some people still use spotify.com, a basic thing which we need to remember.That is, whatever we can do with the for loop, we can do all those things with the while loop and we can also do all those things with the do while loop, that is, all these three loops work the same but their syntax will be a little different. Now my favorite syntax is the for loop, so whenever I have to use it in the code, I mostly use the for loop. We need all three, but whichever you find easier to learn, you can use them.You can use one repeatedly in your codes, there will be no problem, all the work can be done with one of these three loops, but all three have to be remembered, firstly because in the college exam, if the teacher has asked that you answer this question and you have to answer it only through the for loop or only while loop, then there can be a problem at that time. So in that case, the syntax of all three should be known. First of all, let s talk about the for loop.
