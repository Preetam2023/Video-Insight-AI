How can we avoid this? At the end, if my reverse number is having a zero extra, then we can write here r e r ba 10. Okay, once we write it, the work should be done. Run the code, we write t 3 4, so only 4321 is coming, but why should we do this, okay, nothing can be done without this, so once.Let s dry run this question and let me explain where we made a small mistake. Okay, we just made a mistake in the order. Okay, we didn t face much problem here. We just made a mistake in our little else. Okay, here is our big code. Come on brother, let s look at it. Let s dry run this code. Dry run it in your pen copy. You will also dry run it. Okay, let s see what mistakes are coming, then agree.I will take the value of n.
