I write sum here. Okay, sum is our zero. Same while i y is the same, I mean the same while n is not.Equal to 0 and then we remove these conditions, look at their order, look carefully, what is the first thing we have to do, friend, we have to bring a new variable by doing the last digit, now we will initialize it anywhere, now here we will write the last digit, capitalize it D, once it is ok, what will be the value of the last digit, friend, I had said n modelo 10, so n modelo is 10 last digit.Now the value is done, what is the new value of the sum? Sum is equal to sum plus how much is our last digit here, so look at the last digit and then n in n div ba 10, so three things are happening here, okay, model 10 is also being used, this is also being used and then of course we write the sum. We write the sum of digits is the sum. Okay, so let s run this code once and see enter a number 1 2.
