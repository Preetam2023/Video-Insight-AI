student. The first condition in this is marks. If the class day is 30 then C grade has to be given. Between 30 and 70 then B has to be given. Between 70 and 90 then A has to be given and between 90 and 100 then A Ps has to be given. Now we have to write these four conditions in the form of code.If yes, then marks start one after the other. We must have given marks. In this case, we cannot use ternary because ternary is very complicated. We will check the marks. If our marks are less than 30, then in that case we will print C as our grade. Now we will apply else if. If the above condition has failed, then check the below one that our marks are greater than equal to 30 and end marks are less than ours.What was the condition of 70? Now whenever I take a question with marks, I try very hard to give more grades so that even if a child has got less, he does not feel bad.
