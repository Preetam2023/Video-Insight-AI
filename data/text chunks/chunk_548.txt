u are able to write this very complex function yourself, which means you have a good level of logic.Things are coming and programming is coming, so inside this function we have used two library functions, one for copying the string and one for concatenating the string. So much of our work became easy and within two lines we simply did it. So this is the power of our library functions. So finally we will get our new password printed. What will we do inside the main function? Let s call this function and pass the sorting in which we will pass our password. We will do this.Save it and run it, enter your password, test it, we have a new password, the test tooth is printed, run it once again, so this time suppose we have entered the password of our college, this time our college tooth is printed, so in this way, by using many library functions, we can create many interesting functions, we can do many interesting things and the code will become very easy because you are getting the entire fu
