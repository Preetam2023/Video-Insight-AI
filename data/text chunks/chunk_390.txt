aScript, let s say you are studying any other programming language like Go, you are studying C, etc.These concepts also exist inside which we are studying here, the concepts of our functions, the concepts of our loops, the concepts of our if else, even in some languages, you will be able to play with the pointer and now we are going to read about the function call which is an important topic in itself, our function call is when we write the calling statement, like we have created a function sum, for that we have written sum of a and b functions.There are two types of calls inside c, first is call by value and second is call by reference. First of all, let us see the example of call by value. We have already read call by value. There is nothing new in it. I will show you something which we have already read. And then I will tell you that it was called call by value, so let s write a normal program. Here you might be thinking that suddenly with pointer.
