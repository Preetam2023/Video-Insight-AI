like f off f off f offOne which again it applied itself, then first of all the inner call will work. What will the inner call do? It will give us 4 forExample Similarly, what is a normal function call, that is, when one function calls another function, what happens in it? We have a main function. What does the main function do? It calls a normal function f. This normal function does some work for us and returns a value to the main function. It is possible that this normal function is calling some other function and that is doing some work.Return f and give one to one and f returns one to the main function which has control of its own. In this way our normal function is called but whenever we talk about recursion, there is something special inside the recursion. Our main function inside the recursion, if a function is giving to the function fxxx.pro, then every time the call is being made to itself, then the functions which call themselves again and again are called recursive functions.
