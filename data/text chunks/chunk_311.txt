If you start seeing magic, then there is no need to worry at all, you are learning programming.Recurrence means that whenever a function calls itself When a function calls another function, a function calls another function, a Namaste function calls a banju function, or another function calls another function, this happens normally in programming, but when a function calls itself and then calls itself again, this process is called recursion.The function keeps calling itself again and again. Like, first of all let s see it with the help of an example. We have to ask a question whose name is Print Hello World five times. We have to print Hello World five times but we have to print it five times. Now we could have done it with the help of item statement i.e. we could have done it with the help of loops but here we will use recurs. Well, a small thing which can seem quite interesting. If any work in programming is done with loops.
