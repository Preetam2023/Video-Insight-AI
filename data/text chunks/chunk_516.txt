in the character pointer SDR, so this Hello World, our entire Hello World will be stored inside our memory, at the end of which we will have the number 0 and then its address i.e. the address of the first index, the address of this index will be pointing SDR towards this address, so our string is ultimately a pointer because it is a character array in itself, now the character array andThere is a fundamental difference between pointers. What does that difference say? What does that difference say? If you define a string with the help of a pointer, then you can re initialize the string, that is, you can change the value of that string, like today if we have stored Hello World inside the string, then tomorrow we can store only Hello inside the string and after that by changing its value, we can store only World also, but if we have used array notation.If you use it, it will always be Hello World inside it. Let us define the initialism first. So we will make it a string.
