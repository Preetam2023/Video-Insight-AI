n and run. So now we have finally got six and star. PTR is also six, so how do we write the pointer.What value is stored in the pointer, how to print it, how to get the address of the variable, how to get the value of the variable from the address, how to get the value from the address stored on the pointer, we have explored a lot of things and these are the questions that you should be asking about the pointer. Whether your college students are asking you or the recruiter is asking the same, there will be a similar form in this form which can be changed to give you an M somewhere.Will give it somewhere At some places they will give you a slip, at some places they will ask you to take out the address, at some places they will ask you to take out the valued address and mostly children go into this confusion. The best way is to look at the basics that we have just discussed and if there is even a slight confusion, then look at it once more.
