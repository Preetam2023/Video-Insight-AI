c, let s make a function, comment it out, make a function, int check, infact let s void check carry. We will pass the character in this, first of all we will pass our string and also a character see void check character in which we will pass the string and our character C. Now how will we check the character, we will put a loop for int aa equals 0 aa till or atr of aa till not equal to our null character aa will keep on happening plus plus if our atr of aa becomes equal to seech then in that case we have to print it, the character is present and print.Get it returned from here itself, that is, end the function right here. The function will end as soon as we get the character, so there will be no hassle. If we get the character, get it returned in the same way and after that, what will happen. All the further checks to be done will not happen because the character has been found here and if it is not found, then nothing has to be done.
