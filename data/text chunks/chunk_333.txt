Then he called factorial 3. Multiply it by four. Then he called factorial two and multiply it by 2.Let s call three and then multiply the factorial one by that. Let s call two and multiply the factorial 0 by that. What is the factorial of one? One gives because this is our base case. Now it returned the value here 1 1 2 will give us 2 Here pay two returned it gave 2 3 6 Here pay 6 returned it gave 6 4 24If it returned 24 then it gave 24 5 120 so the final answer we had 120 printed for factorial fv. The next thing we will talk about is some properties of recursion, so recursion has some properties of its own. First of all, anything that can be done with it s iteration can be done with it s iteration and vice versa. All the work that we did with it s iteration through loop is done with it s iteration.And whatever work we do with recurs can be done through it all. Just sometimes recurs helps, sometimes loops help in writing very simple code.
