en dot roll number. So what will happen with this is that we have stored our data inside the memory.100 structures have been created in this, this is our row student of EEC, this is the first student of EC, this is the second student of EC and so on, inside this student he has his own name, one roll number and one CGPA student also has his own name, one roll number and one CGPA and same three information for this student. Every student has his own individual information and if we consider this information asEC 0 A of the student, if we want to access the roll number of the student, then what will we write? EC of 0 dat roll number. Now, if we want to assign a roll number to it, let us assume that by assigning 1664, then that assignment is possible in this way. So, first of all, we will write the name of our array, then we will write the index, after that by putting a dot, we will write the name of our property which we want to access, similarly I0 roll number and I0 CGPA.
