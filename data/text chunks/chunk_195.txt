. If it is not divisible by two, then it is not divisible by two. Not equal to zero is ours anytime. If this is happening, then what do you have to do? Friend, if there is an odd number inside the even number, then you have to add sum ps aa and if there is an even number, then you write if aa mud.2 equ equ 0 So I have to subtract that from the even number. Sum minus a is okay. That even number has to be minus. Okay, sum is minus a. Here P again here you can also write this else. It is not needed because it is either even or odd. Okay, so by doing this our answer will come exactly. Let s run it once and see. I put the number seven, the answer is four. Is it really four? Let s try.
