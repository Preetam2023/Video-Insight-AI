sics that we have just discussed and if there is even a slight confusion, then look at it once more. After that, ask a lot of questions on the points. Once we ask a lot of questions, especially a day before the paper or a day before our interview, then everything will be clear.Now the next thing we will talk about about points is pointer to pointer. Pointer to pointer is a variable which is storing the address of another pointer, so the variable that stores the memory address of another point, for example, our memory is inside it, first of all we created a variable A inside which is stored 22, the address of this variable is 210 now.
