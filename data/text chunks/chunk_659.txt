ow that we have reached the end of our file, which means we have traversed all the data and read it. Now there is no such data inside our file.Whenever we read the data through F gate, the advantage of reading the characters is that after reading the data, we get the EOF. For example, suppose we have stored a lot of data inside our file, this is a random string of words, so we have stored a lot of data in this manner and if we want to read this entire data, then to read this entire data, we will have to read it character by character plus at the end we add aYou will put a limit on how long you have to read till the EO comes, then write a simple code for it, you will notice that inside each code, these two lines of opening and closing the file are constant. After declaring the file pointer, now we are going to open this file in read mode and read it character by character, so first of all let s make character C which is going to read all the values, now inside C is the first one.
