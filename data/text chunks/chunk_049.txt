percent. This M percent i.e. end is actually an address. This is the address of this variable, i.e. what will it do? Inside the memory, where a block of memory has been given to the edge, it will go to that address and whatever input comes to us, it will be sent to that address.After going and storing it, the work of scanf is something like this. Now what do we do by inputting a number and let s see how it actually scans. Scan F is a number. We make it a variable edge. Now we will write here print F. Enter edge. Now let s scan this variable. Scan F to percentage D. Address edge. And whatever value we get stored there, we will get it printed i.e. again percentage D. Before this we write edge.Let s save this, now go up and open our terminal. First of all, we have to enter our edge. We have printed 22. Edge is 22, so whatever edge we had entered has come back to us in print.
