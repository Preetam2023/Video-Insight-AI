the same because call by reference has been done. It means now we are talking about memory location. Now directly we are talking about the plot whose address we know, now it is not about the name of that variable.If it is going on then inside the call by value where The memory address is different. Our values are copied. In call by reference, the values remain the same. We access the memory address directly. This is a very important distinction to remember. The last question in the points that we will talk about is Write a function to calculate the sum product and average of two numbers. Print that average in the main function. Along with the average, the product and the sum are also called in the main function.If you want to print inside the function, then we will create a function here which will take two numbers a and b and will calculate the sum of both i.e.
