r this also the next line is needed and even after this, if the next line is needed then we save it.Now we will run it again here, now our output has gone to the next line. What actually happened is that it printed Hello C, then Hello C got printed, after that we printed BaSn, then backSlaA, i.e. next line, so we came here, then again HelloC was printed, then again BaSn, then we came to the next line. In the same way, whenever we have to bring the output to the next line, we write BaSn. Now let s assume that we have written aWe have created a variable inside our code, like if we have written int a e equal to 22 and we want to print this edge, how to print this edge on our screen, then for this we will have to write print f edge is, do we write edge, once we see the output of this thing, edge is edge, then whatever we have written inside the double quotes, we call it a string, that is, this thing will be printed as it is, but we have to print the number inside its edge.
