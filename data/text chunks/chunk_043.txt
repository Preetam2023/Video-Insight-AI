think a little in this, next after this I will give homework, I will show it by doing this question.Print all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Hey friend, how to do this. There are two ways to do this. The first way is the code which prints all the numbers from 1 to 100, which is Here s mine, okay, inside this code, we will discuss all the things even and odd in 100 to 100. This is the code from 1 to 100 which I have to print 100 times, then do one thing in it, put an if condition inside it. Of course we can put it inside for luck, which will just say what if my number is even then print it. Simple see how our code is going to be here, we will just use if, whatever our number is.In this case I is that number, we are printing I again and again, if A is divisible by two, that is, it is an even number, then only print that number, I is ok, then print F, percentage, D and A is ok, so let s see once. This code will run. We can also write it in one line.
