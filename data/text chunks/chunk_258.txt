ts are there in 153? 1, 5 and 3. Okay, what is amazing is the cube of 1 the cube of 5 the cube of 3. Actually, it gives me the answer of 153. There will definitely be more numbers like this. There are also our numbers here but you have to think for yourself like one in itself is an Armstrong number, there is only one digit and the cube of one is also one.153 is an Armstrong number, there may be two or four more Armstrong numbers like this, you have to print all the numbers from 1 to 500, so what is the hint, friend, your first hint is that the off course loop will work from 1 to 500, it is fine, you repeat it again and again, what you have to do is pay attention. Again the hint is this cube of 1, cube of 5, cube of 3, I can also write this as cube of 3, cube of 5.Cube of Q 1. If you remember when I was finding out the sum of digits, we have coded the sum of digits. Just what to do here is to code the cubes of that too. So think about this on your own and try to solve it.
