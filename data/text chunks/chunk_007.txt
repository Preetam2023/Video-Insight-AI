s greater than the alpha for T minus 1 and also when it is squaring up the negative gradient suppose if it is available like that which is also bringing the positive value right like this so always the alpha T value will become positive constraint when uh you are looking this equation Alpha t Okay Alpha T is inversionally proportional inversely proposed to the E30 okay so from this equation when you are increasing the alpha T automatically ETA T is becoming low so this makes the alpha T Alpha uh Alpha T makes the equation uh adaptively update the E30 value that means this uh Alpha T is changes the uh E30 adaptively for each and every iterations so when uh the is decreasing it needs more number of iterations to reach the convergence point but the uh the alpha T is updating the 830 by changing this Alpha T at every iteration so we need not to select the learning rate manually like another algorithms so and also Alpha uh T makes the um for a mix the learning rate uh learning rate changes
