ccount number will also be printed for us and the account password will also be printed here for us. When I try to print these things, both of them will be printed forMe but generally this is a bad practice because the account password is such a thing that maybe inside this code we should not pass it outside this account class because whatever is publicly available increases the chances of accidental changes inside it and decreases the security inside it. That is why whenever we implement something in the objects and classes inside the code in which we feel that any information is sensitive or we do not want to pass this information outside.
