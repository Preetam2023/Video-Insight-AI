omes twice, then here the condition of if will be changed, we will compare it with h and count them.Take or how many times D comes or how many times A comes, then we can create different types of functions according to different conditions. The next question which we will talk about is check if a given character is present in a string and not like we have been given a string, Hello World, now we have been given a character along with the character C which is D, we have to check whether this character is present inside this string or not, yes and no, if D is present inside it then print.It will be yes, if character S is ours, suppose A is capital A then capital A is not present, small L is present then in that case we print no or if character S is ours x thenIs equal next one i 1? Is equal as soon as it becomes equal? Print S, otherwise print no at the end. If we work with simple logic, let s make a function, comment it out, make a function, int check, infact let s void check carry.
