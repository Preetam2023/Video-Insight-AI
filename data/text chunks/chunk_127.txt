write the code for this and check X first.We declare then scan F and first print F. Enter a number. Here we will enter the number then we will scan it. Percentage D andOperator President If operators were below then here first the module ofWill 10 be printed as one in 10 because 10 is divided with two, whenever we entered 10, the module of 10 came out first with two, then what was the module Ro, if we compared that row with Ro, it returned true, then it returned true, but here in the case of five, the module of five came with two, so we compared one with Ro, it was not equal to two, that is why Ro was printed.That means false, now there is another version of this, that version of the same program is Tell if a number is even and odd. The numbers which are divided with two are our even numbers. The numbers which are not divided with two, that is, their module does not come to us as zero, they are our odd numbers.
