have typecast it in unsigned int, so do not take so much tension about warnings, now look carefully.First of all, if we call the print address, then the statement there will run, then the value of this integer n, its address is printed here and then the address of our original n, which is n inside the main function, is printed and both the addresses are different, this is our call by value here, if the call was by reference, that is, there would have been a star here, there would have been a star here too and here we print the value of n.Getting it done means getting the value stored in this pointer printed and from here we are passing it in the print address. So the address of n has become call by reference. Now let us analyze our output. Now both the addresses that have come inside the output are the same because call by reference has been done. It means now we are talking about memory location.
