ld that there will be an integer value n. Here we do not need to tell that there will be an integer. Can we directly call from here without telling the data type? These are very important keywords which we need to pay attention to, we call it argument, we call it parameter, now save this code and run it once by opening a new terminal window, then in print F, we tell the type, percentage, D, save and run our number.If we enter then we have to print the table of fives, so it has been printed for us. 5 10 15 should have been printed in the next next line. Let s compile it once again and print the table of fives. So this time the table of fives has been printed. 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 In this way, let s take a look at the code. Have we done a little recap? We have done ourCreated a function which was declared with the name print table, took the number from the user and then called it. The value we passed to our print table number n is called argument or our parameter.
