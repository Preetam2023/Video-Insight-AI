he percentage is put in s then we will have to insert the null character separately to show that it is a string, after that we will print our entire string. From put s, ATR will save it.And now run is giving us this warning because here we had to enter the address of CA. Now we can enter any string of ours. Suppose we have entered Hello World, for us it is Hello World, after getting printed and coming back, it has also counted the spaces in it. So this is the function which we have created by ourselves. This part acts like our gates or acts like our F gates, it will take the entire sentence as long as our size isWe are putting less than 100 in it, whether you put space, put special character in it, put letter in upper case, put letter in smaller case, put numbers, everything will take input but as soon as you press enter, it will stop taking input and it will append null character in our string. The next question which we will talk about is a special one.
