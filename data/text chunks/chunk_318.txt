to itself, then the functions which call themselves again and again are called recursive functions.And we call this process recursion. Now there is a very logical way of doing recursion and we will understand this logical method with the help of the question. Our question is the sum of first and natural numbers. We have to find it. Now let us analyze it a little that what can be the sum of the first and natural numbers. The sum ranges from 1 2 3 4 to n 1 n like 5. If we have to find the value for n 5 then it isIt would be 1 2 3 4 5 If for n 4 the solution would be 1 2 3 4 For n 3 the solution would be 1 2 3 For n 2 it would be 1 2 For n 1 it would be 1 Now n 0 cannot be because row is a whole number and is not a natural number. Here we will observe a pattern. The pattern is that in n allThis value is common in natural numbers. After this, this value is common. After this, this value is common. Then this value is common.
