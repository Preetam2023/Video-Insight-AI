dent s roll number from percentage D, then here we can write s1 dot roll number, save it and run it. So what is happening is that it is running normally, that is, like before, inside the single line, we have created the variable of our structure and thenWe assigned the values inside and after that we used those values in the next line. In the same way, if you already know all the values for a structure, then it is best to assign it in one go. Next let s talk about points to structures, like our points are to arrays, points are to strings, points are to characters, we can create a pointer for each variable.Similarly, we can create a pointer for a structure also because ultimately structure is also a data type. If we have declared a variable of structure type s1 then how will we declare the pointer for it.
