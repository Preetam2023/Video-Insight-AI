age s. This format is a specification string in which some value is stored. Now we have to print it. Instead of printing it character by character, a very easy way is to write the percentage s. It means that this format is specified, so all this is done for our print F, but if we want to scan F, then we can do that also automatically with percentage s. For example, suppose we have defined a string in the name of character name.We have given the maximum size of the string from 40. Now if we have to scan it, then scan f percentage s and here we will write name. Why name is written here? Address of name is not written because name is ultimately string. What is character array? What is character array? Array is always a pointer, so the name of the string is a pointer in itself, that is, name is a pointer, so there is no need to write end name here, only name is enough, so in this way. We can also scan f from percentage s and print f. Let s see the example of both.
