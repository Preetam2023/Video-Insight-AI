e this row has come, that means it is divisible by two, then it has become composite, but we know that if it does not come, then it is not divisible by two, it is not ours, we have not tried this, okay, then we divided 25 by three, we saw that reminder, of course, zero is not coming, so it is not divisible by three, 25 is ours, okay, by doing like this, we went to 25, friend, by four, weSee, it is not divisible, then we saw that if we divide 25 by f, then yes this is equal to zero. It is divisible by pa, so it simply means that if 25 is divisible by any number other than 25, then it is a composite number. It is a simple thing, so we are going to solve our question like this and obviously because I have to divide it by many numbers, then I have to look at one.
