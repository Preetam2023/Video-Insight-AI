esn t want to convert the big type into small but it will have to do it because we have written int. Now let s save it and now let s compile it again and see that now it has compiled successfully and now if we run our code, the output will be that will be one. So whenever it has converted this double value in C by default, all theThere are float values, they are seen as double because double is a big data type. Now when it converted this double value i.e. this value into int, then it completely removed this 999999, it does not round off. In some operations, whenever it converts from float to int, it does not round off that if it is 1.99, then make it two and then put two in int jar.
