print statement enter three prices. First of all we will scan our first price from percentage F i.e. m percent price of zero and in the same way m percent price of one and then print every time after that.Will get it done in fact Total price one is equal to two Here we will write price of 0 plus 0.18 multiplied by price of G In a way, we have added GST on 18 here in this way, we will repeat the same thing three times inside the price Here price two Here price r 1 multiplied by 0.18 ofv 2 multiplied by 0.18 We will save it, so this is our final or total prices with GST.And once we run it, here the format is Percentage F Percentage A. Now first of all we have to add three prices, so 100, 200 and 300, then these GST values have come to us. First of all, 118, then 236, then 354, these three prices have come. For some space, we could have also inserted Back S, let s save it and run it once again, so these three prices have come with.Added GST and total price can be done in this way.
