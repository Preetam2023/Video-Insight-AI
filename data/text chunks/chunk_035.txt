ifference, then if I remove this and write this, then also the same work will be done, but the same.The only difference is that as soon as I make this declaration, that is, if I create the box separately, then what will be the difference that I am creating outside and if now I want to print the value of i, then it will be that and 11 will come, see this, 11 Sorry, here I wrote six, I am so sorry, according to the code, the sen value of i will come here, because the first value of i was one, so this is printed, print f, okay, the value of i is one.Is one less than 6? Yes, then print it once. Increase the value of i plus pi by one. i becomes two. Okay, is two less than six? Yes, print F. By doing this, when we printed it six times, the last one got updated by one. The value of i became seven. Another plus became because it is the last step. Then we saw whether seven is less than 6. Otherwise, the loop ended.
