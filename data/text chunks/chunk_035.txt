program, then our program looks something like this. This is our initial code which we have written. The first thing that is written in it is hash include. Then our angular brackets come and in the middle we have std add a. This is what we call our pre processor directive. Now what is a pre processor directive, we will read it later. For now, we have to understand that we always have to write this line inside our code, otherwise our C code is not running.After that, we always write this line, int main, after that our parentheses and then the curly braces and whatever part is written inside these curly braces, this is the code of our main. The execution of our program starts from the main function, that is, from this function, the function is a part of our code which does some work for us. We are also going to read about the functions in detail. Any C program is always started from the main function.
