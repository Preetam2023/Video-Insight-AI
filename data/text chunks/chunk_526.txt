lude the string D.Let s save it. Here we have called string length in which we have passed our name. Now let s run the code. Actually, this is STRL, it is string length. It returns us unsigned long, meaning it does not return the integer value, it returns unsigned long of length, but we can also type cast it, that is, we will create a variable length and store it in this length. The output of the string length will be an integer.It will be of type and then we get this variable named length printed, compile and run again, so the length of seven has been output to us. Now if we change our string, suppose we write another name here, then what will happen again is our length, that is, the number of characters, all of them will be added, that is, the length will now become four. Now the next library function that we will talk about is our string copy. What does string copy do? It is called ATR.
