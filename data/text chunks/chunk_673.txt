ation now.Before talking about dynamic memory allocation, let us understand how memory is allocated. Whenever we write a program, one is static memory allocation and one is dynamic memory allocation. Whenever we write a C program and inside it we make some When we create a variable, what the C compiler does is that it checks the data type of that variable and already allocates the memory accordingly, that is, reserves it, but sometimes such cases may come in which our requirement of memory may change in the middle of the code, like if suppose you have created an array and in that array you want to store how many children are enrolled in your class, then suppose there are 30 children in your class.
