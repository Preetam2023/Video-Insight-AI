A 22. This variable is storing a value and what is that value? That value is a number and this one.It can be any number, it is a data value, that is, someone is storing data, but if someday it comes to our mind, how all this work is happening inside the memory, we had already talked about that there are blocks inside the memory, inside the blocks some data is stored, wherever that data is stored, we give some name to that place, which name we call a variable. Now whatever is that block of memory, it must have some address inside the memory, like this memory.The address is 2010. The address of this memory is 2013. Here we are talking about the addresses of these blocks. How can we understand this? Suppose we have the complete meaning of the whole. That meaning is our memory. On top of that, there are different plots which are owned by different people. Now it makes us visualize each block. This is a plot on which we have built a house.
