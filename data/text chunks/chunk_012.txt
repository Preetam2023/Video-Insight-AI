or that Person object has no attribute called hello because here we have used underscore underscore. Now here as a beginner the question may come in our mind that why have we created such a function which we can never use with the object because there are functions of this type generally which want to use some other function internally. For example, here we have a function named Welcome.And let s create a function and this is a completely normal function, this is normal, this is our method and what it does is it will first print hello in this way and after that or what it passes inside hello, it passes its name. This is going to be self dot name in fact here also we make self and then our name value will come to us, then it will call the hello function and inside that we will pass self.That is, it will pass its name like this, let s say underscore underscore and what is this welcome function doing? This welcome function is calling hello, so if it wants, it can call complete hello.
