if I run it seven times, it is okay. If I write six instead of seven, it is printed six times, okay. 1 2 3 45 6 So once let me explain to you the meaning of this code in pen and paper so that you can understand internally what the for loop is doing and why because of this number, just this six. Instead of this, if I write something else instead of six, then it is printing that many times. Why is it happening like if I suppose I write i e equal to here, then it will be printed zero times, that is, nothing will be printed at all. Look, if nothing is printed, then this is a lot of work.It s cool but how is it doing, let s remember once here, let s come here to our page and discuss this thing well, why is this happening, okay, let s take a screenshot of it, just talk about this loop, brother, what is happening, finally let s bring it here and now it s amazing to see, okay, let s talk about this code that we have written, for in e 1 i e lane equal to 0, okay I have less.
