to do suspend four and start exploring three from three I can go on 10 so 10 suspend three start exploring 10 there is no adjacent vertex of 10 so go back to three so how to know where I have to go back this stack will give me their value so this three continue exploring three so I can go on nine 9 and again suspend three and start exploring N9 from 9 I cannot go anywhere then go back to three and start exploring three so who is adjacent to three two so two is visited then from two who is adjacent suspend two and start exploring two so from two 8 is adjacent so take eight now start exploring eight so from there I can go on seven so suspend eight so 7 is visited now we have to explore seven from Seven I can go on five so five is newly visited now we have to start exploring five so suspend seven and push it into the stack then from five who is adjacent six so visit six suspend five and continue exploration of six there is nothing adjacent to six so go back to five from five where I can
