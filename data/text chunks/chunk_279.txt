and indirectly from main. Whenever a function is called inside C, that means the function is called.To get the work done, either the main function calls it directly like we did in our case. What is happening in this case is that our functions are being called from within the main function or the other function is calling some other function like what do we do here, we call Namaste, whatever the nationality, we will greet him in both the greetings. We have called Namaste and Namaste, what are you doing, Namaste?After printing, what happened is that the main function called this function of ours and the Namaste function called our second function, so this second function is indirectly called from the main function because the main function had called Namaste, so in this way, if any function is called inside c, then either the main function calls it directly or the main function calls it.Indirectly calls through some other function.
