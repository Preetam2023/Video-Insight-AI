the double has to be scanned.So we will use percentage F. Float automatically comes to us as input. Now the next question which we will be talking about is the name of the right functions to calculate the area of a square, a circle and a rectangle. So we have to create three functions. One function will calculate the area of a square, one will calculate the area of a circle and one will calculate the area of a rectangle. First of all, we will declare all three functions in our program at the top.Let s talk about area of square. What will area of square do? Assume that only side will come as integer and if square will come then integer will be its return type or let s make it float. Float will be its return type and its name is square area. We will be passing inside it we will write the definition of side of the square. Float is not integer but side, it should be a floating value. Square area will come in. We have the parameter float side is the area of a square.
