the address of operator end.Marks of zero, after that the same process will be repeated three times. Now the marks of Chemistry and here the marks of Maths and the second time when marks will be taken input will be at zero position. So already we have taken the input of Physics marks. Now we have to store the Chemistry marks at the first position and the Maths ones at the second position and now if we want to print it then we will get it printed in this manner Physics E is equal to the percentage of Chemistry E.Equal to Percentage D Math E Equal to Percentage D and here Marks of Zero Marks of One So I hope it will be understood that Marks of Zero i.e. a single variable, only the value of zero position is required, only the value of first position is required and only the value of second position is required, let s save and run, so first of all we will enter the marks of Physics, then we will enter the marks of Chemistry.
