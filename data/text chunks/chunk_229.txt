, we can print that number, after this we can do one thing that put the value of b inside a, okay a.Remove the value of b and put the value of b and remove the b inside b and then put the sum. Okay and then put a p b inside the sum. 1 P 2 3 Are you understanding what is going on? Do you understand? Now do one thing again. Put the value of b inside a. Then cut out the one and put t inside b. Put the value of sum inside b. Instead of t, I put ri and put the sum of these two inside the sum i.e. F, so I hope you.Something must be visible here, once we make it bigger, okay listen back, okay, here we are doing all the things well, okay, first this step, second, put the value of B inside A, then put the value of sum inside B, these three steps, we created three variables and in the beginning, A and B were given just one, then we are performing these three steps again and again, now let s look back once, okay, I have put B inside A.
