ow whether we take the sum of 1 2 3 or we take the sum of 3 to 1, the sum of both is ultimately six.If we are going to come close, then the value of the sum of both will be equal, hence whether we are going from one to n or from n to w in the loop, it will not matter if we are calculating the sum, here we will do sum sum j, then instead of 1 2 3, it will become 3 2 1, so if we save it once and run it, then we will get the same output, that is 3.To 1 and sum we will have the correct calculate that is six so this is the way our for loop works and different things we can do inside it now next if we talk about the question then the next question is print the table of a number input by the user user will be giving us a number we have to print the table of that like user has given two then two key we will print the table how will we print first two then four then six then 8 10 12 1416 18 20 If user gave us 42 So we will have to print the table of 42 which obviously I will not be able to do q
