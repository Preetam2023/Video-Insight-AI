ter closing the file, we will open it in our write mode and as soon as we open it in write mode, then what will happen automatically?If it gets overwritten, the old data will be deleted. Till then we will store that data in int a and b inside our local variables, so for this also we write the code. First of all, create a file like txt.gz, inside it we will pass f ptr end and then int b and address of b for the integer jr b which specifies our format. Now we have read a and b and now we close the file. After closing the file, now we will open it again.You can open it again with the help of the same pointer. In your write mode, we will open it in write mode and print F inside the file. We will add the data A PTR Percentage D. Our sum i.e. a and b. Now we will close the file again. So first of all we read a and b. We closed the file with the file and opened it next time. What did we do in write mode in write mode? Now we overwrote inside the file a b i.e. both.
