which there are no true false. Instead of true false, we have one, and instead of false, we have ro. In fact, any non zero integer is if inside c we write like 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 5, all of them represent true but if whereIf zero comes, it means false inside C. So the students who are learning C after learning Java, C PS, after JavaScript, they will find it a bit strange that there is no such thing as true and false inside C. One is there in place of true and zero is there in place of false, so if one is printed in equal to equal two, then it means the statement is true and if false is printed, then we will get zero on the screen, there are two other relations which we check.
