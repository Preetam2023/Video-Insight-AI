will be stored inside the pointer, so let s try it once, first of all, let s create a function, declare the function void print numbers, there is an array inside the print numbers and its size comes, so this array we defined with the help of square brackets and the size.Made a normal integer, now let s also define it, void print numbers inside which we have int array and int n. Now we will run a loop according to the size of the array which will run from zero to n, so here is the condition of less than n. Every time we are doing i p and will print the elements of the array, then print f percentage d b s t and here we will write a r r of i like in the next line.It is called bull t, it gives us the space of one tab, so whatever numbers will be printed, they will be printed after some space, so it will look good in this way and in the last, let s print the next line from B.
