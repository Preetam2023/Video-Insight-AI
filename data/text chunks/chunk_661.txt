ow we will take the new value f from gut s inside it, f ptr and finally we will print the next line.Let us understand this code very carefully on the console. Character CA. We have taken a dummy character, after getting the data read inside it, we will get the data stored here from the file. Got the first character read and then put a loop. Inside the loop, we have to keep reading the characters till the end of the file comes, then it shows the condition till the character is not equal to the end of the file. Now we will keep printing the same, then read the next character again and then print it.We will get it done again, we will read the next character, we will get it printed again, we will read the character again and again until we come to the end of the file inside this character.
