4. This can be written as 2 fto 3. This can be written as 1 fto 2. And this will always be our one. Obviously, how will we calculate below this? Either we will write 0 factorial which is also row but we cannot multiply it by row, so base case we can put it on 1 factorial where the value of pe will be already defined, so here also we have aRecurve function has become a recurve function. If we have to find out the factorial of n, what will be its value? You tell me the factorial of n 1. What I have to do in that is to multiply my n. This is our recursive function. It is exactly like the sum. If you want to find the sum of n, then what to do. Sum of n 1. Tell me, I will add n to it. Similarly, tell me the factorial of n in the factorial. I will add n 1 to it.If I multiply, my factorial of n will come to me, then we convert this same method into code. At the top, we will write our function factorial in which we have to find the factorial of any number n.
