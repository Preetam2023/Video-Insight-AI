do many interesting things and the code will become very easy because you are getting the entire function in a single line, so our question is something like this.That is, write a function name slice which takes a string and returns a slice string from index n to n. Let us understand this with an example. Slice is a function. Its work is to take a string. Suppose we have taken a string. Hello World and inside it we will be given two indices, one will be n, one will be indexed. The value of our n is given to us 3. The value of m is given 6, so we have to return a string which will start from n 3. 6, that is, if we talk about this string, its index is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and neither. Our slice function will take the string as input and will give us the output from three to six, i.e. from A to O. L O W O. So, Hello World, the string was H E L L R L D. This AOD part will be returned to us from inside it because it starts from n 3 index and ends at m 6 index.
