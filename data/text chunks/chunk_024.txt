variables should always be meaningful i.e. we should understand the variable as soon as we read it.Come, what is stored inside it, like here we have stored the age, we have given the name of the variable as age, if we have stored a star, then we have given its name as Star, if we have stored any random number, then we have given the name as a number, sometimes random, yes, we can keep the names like ABC because it is easy, but whenever we are writing a big program, there will be a lot of variables by doing ABC in it, that is why it is very important to give meaningful names there, so if you go ahead, you can keep names like ABC in your interviews.
