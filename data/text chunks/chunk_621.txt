lso and get it. So, we have the full capability to complicate it a little based on these structures. Next one of the theorems is to test your concept. You have to storeThe marks of 30 students. We have to store the marks of 30 children. Our marks will be of either integer type or float type. Now what will we use? Float type marks are what we are learning here. Either make an array of 10 floats or make a structure. Now if we have to store the marks of 30 children here and each value is of our float type, then the smart decision here will be to make an array of 10 floats.What will be the benefit of making floats of 10? Above the structure, first of all, the major use of structures is when we are collecting things of different types together, but here we have to collect 30 things of the same type, i.e. of float type, so for that it will be better that we can make an array, we can make both, our question will be solved by both, but it will be smarter, more experience.
