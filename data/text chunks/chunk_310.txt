the area of the rectangle?Float b 10.0 Now let s print the value of our area. Area is percentage f. Here we will call rectangle area in which we will pass the first value a and then the second value is our b. Let s save this code. We have declared all the three functions. We have defined all the three functions. Inside the main function, we will calculate the area of the rectangle by testing A and B. We open the terminal, compile and run it.The output we have is 5 10 50. In this way, you can create many functions inside the code and according to your taste, we can get the same work done by calling whatever function we need. Next topic about which we are going to talk in C, its name is Rikars. Now Rikars, students who are learning programming for the first time may find it a magical topic. If you start seeing magic, then there is no need to worry at all, you are learning programming.
