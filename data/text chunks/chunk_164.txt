ro, now here we are going to use the while loop because what is our condition, let s come back here.What is our condition? The condition should be that we should run the loop until my A is equal to zero.Till then keep dividing and keep writing your code, then I have to write while here I will write n is not equal to 0 unless n is equal to zero so first of all n is divided by 10 and here I will make my count plus plus and at the end I have to print from what digit so here we write na yaar print F print F and here we directly write the digits R the number of digits R percentage.D And here we will count, okay let s run it once, let me explain it to you in a little more detail, so we have run this code, I have written the enter number, so I write T 4 5 6, so this is a five digit number, so look at the number of digits R F, okay, you understand, I run back enter number 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, so this is an eight digit number, so our code is working well.
