r our day is, it is Monday, so we have written Monday, now after this we will break in the same way.We are going to write six more cases, so here we will do case two, inside that we will write our day Tuesday, put the next line in it, put the next line here, our case three, inside this too, the next line is case four, this is going to be case fi is Friday, now let us assume that our user has given us by entering 29, so in that case we cannot print anything, so in that case we will write the default here i.e. our else s one.Case now by default we will print not a valid day. Now after the default we do not have to write break because after the default there is no switch which we can turn on after this. Now let s save it. Once we run the code then we will understand well how the compile run is done. First of all we have to enter the day. We enter let s say three three. If we enter then Wednesday is printed for us as soon as the value of day is entered.
