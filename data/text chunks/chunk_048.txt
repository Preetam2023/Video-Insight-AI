e go till our 20, 10 becomes 20, so I write here 2. Now see, I will do one thing, write 20 and here.Let me give i i P 2 Now see the table of two will be printed, see the table of two is printed 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Okay, so what is happening in this code, I basically just changed my box, first started from two which was my end point, here the condition was imposed till the table of two runs and my increment here is how much is two.Every number which is next in the table is bigger than two. Okay, so that is done. Similarly, if I tell you the table of 19, then you must have understood. Here, if I write 19, I put a condition. I am 190 and I write here i 19, then what happens is that the table of 19 will be printed, 19 38 57 up to 190. Do you understand what I am saying? First 19 is the increment of 19. In the table of 19, 19 keeps happening, isn t it 19 19 38 19 57 19, our 76, then 95, then dd.
