nd the sum till four, and add five to it, then this is our sum till four, and we have added to that.Given five, what does it mean, find the sum up to n 1 and add n to it, then all these numbers are giving us the sum up to n 1 and in that we have added our n in the same way, here we have the sum till two, to which we have added three, here we have added up to one, to which we have added two, so in a way we are able to see that we have to find the sum of n, so what is it telling us that before finding the sum of n, n Take the sum of 1 and add n to it, then the sum function is the same, meaning the work we are trying to do here and the work we are trying to do here.
