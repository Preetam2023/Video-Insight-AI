e. The next topic which we will talk about is that in the instructions, its name is Type Conversion. Whenever we have different operants, if they have the same type, then the output will also be of the same type, but if their data types are different, then the output will also be of different data type.Also, if we perform any operation on int, only int will come in the output. Whenever we perform operation on float, only float will come in the output. But if the operation of int is done with float, then float will come in the output. When we talk about the table with our data types, neither int takes ours, it takes two bytes and float takes four bytes, so in this way, the container of float is the container of this data type, that is, it can store more values.So what the C compiler does is apply a little bit of logic.
