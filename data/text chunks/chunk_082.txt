and write 34, but this was a better code which I wrote and showed you here, let s move ahead friend.Display This GP Now this is our homework, we have 100 50 25, you have to display this till the end terms but keep in mind here Baba, first of all our term is 100, keep in mind that I will tell you this, here again the next term is 50, then the next term is 25, you can see, it is being multiplied by half, it is being multiplied by half, 25, if it was multiplied by half, then the answer would be 12.5.25 2 We cannot store it in integer, here you use float variable, whose float variable do you use because every time you have to print GP or print anything, then in for loop, you take the same thing, take anti in for loop, take int i 1, take n and i p, that is, our loop will run n times, whatever is our thing inside, here we will run n times, but you just create a new variable.
