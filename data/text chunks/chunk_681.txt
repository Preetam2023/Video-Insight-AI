en we will access it in the form of ptr. Also, to use the Malak, we have to add a std ae bd a above.Name standard library which has to be included which makes us capable of DMA i.e. dynamic memory allocation. So let s try it once. Include the above hash include atd a i by a. First create an int ger pointer. Now we will assign this pointer. The memory given to us by malac. How much memory do we need from malac. So the size of the int ger is equal to 5 int gers and we typecast this pointer.If we give two int pointer then this is our pointer which is pointing here to 20 bytes of memory. Now if such a situation arises in which lock is assumed, let us write here F crore or any number bigger than crore, then a point will come when we will be asking for so much memory which our system does not have. Otherwise, when such a case comes when our system is not able to give us our required number of bytes, then in that case the return is NULL, so our PTR.
