d even once, so how do we control it, how do we control this thing, so here we useWhat is the meaning of an additional box, let s come here once and let s see, we also write this code once more and let s see what is missing in our code. Let s come once and write in this code. Let s come here, let me explain to you the whole algorithm again. Well, let me explain to you. Okay, what did I do? My number is my number, I have taken n. Then I I divided n from 0 to where till n is divided and saw that it is okay if my number is divisible by any of these then it is clear that my number will become composite composite and I noticed one more thing if I put a break statement right there and then and there, if I put a break right there then it is okay, it is over, I came to know about composite, it is fine here but for prime I know what one thing I can do.
