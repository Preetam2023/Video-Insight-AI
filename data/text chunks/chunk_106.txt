ical and assignment. These three are the easiest among them.After the matrix, we will read them now. We will read the ternary operator in the next chapter. Whenever we will be reading the conditional statements and we will read the bitwise operators in the coming chapters, then first of all let us talk about our relational operators. Now relational operators tell the relation between two operands. In Math, whenever we write not a b, we have to check whether a is equal to b, can we do the same inside c?You cannot write like this, if you write a b somewhere inside c, then it will mean that take the value of b and put it in a. If equality checking is not done, then whenever we have to check that the value of a means one value is equal to another value, then we put double equal to a. E b means that here we are asking the question that the value of a is equal to the value of b.
