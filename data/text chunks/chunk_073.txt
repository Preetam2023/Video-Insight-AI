about what are our expressions valid in Arithmetic instructions, what are not some basic operations. We understand that in Arithmetic instructions we have plus operator, minus operator, multiply operator and divide operator. Along with this, we have one more operator.There is a module about which we are going to read right now, within this chapter, these five are our main operators. Now what will be the valid statements in it like a b c, we have written this is a valid statement, that is, here both of them are our operands, this is the operator and on the left hand side, we have written single which is a variable. Talking about the next, b c is also a valid operation because we have got multiplication and we have stored it in a.Now if we talk about invalid in the right hand side, then a is in the right hand side and our b c is in the left.
