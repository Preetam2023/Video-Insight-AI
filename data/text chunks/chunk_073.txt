e it will ask enter a number I say 10 so see 100 97 94 91 82 up to 73 but still I have to tell this.That I have to print further as long as my numbers are positive then in that case what do I do with this n in that case what do I do with this n what does it have to do with it the question here is do you know what is the problem here is we almost understood how to print like we have done this thing here the problem problem is coming here that I don t know what is the number of terms I don t know what is the number of terms if I can figure out thatWhat is the value of n? As long as I run this form, there is no question left. Well, if you know mathematics, then we have read this thing, can you simply understand it? You can find the term, we make this eighth term positive, so 3n comes here, take 100, so n, I am applying a little maths, but apart from that, I will teach you a work around, 100 3, that is, n 33.
