s, only the difference is in the input and output. Now what is the way to write the turner operator. Let us first understand the usage of turner operator whenever we have many lines. Simple if else means checking the condition in if else and then doing something. If we can shorten it like let s say.We have to check the value of the variable, if age is our greater than 18 then here if age is a variable then print adult otherwise not adult. In that we saw that we have written many lines meaning if we see the first one also 1 2 three and else three more then our code is happening in six lines. How to convert that six lines of code into single line. If there is a ternary operator, then the syntax of the ternary operator is that first of all tell your condition, what is the condition, after that put a question mark. This is the function of the question mark that it will check, it will question whether your condition is true or not.
