w you here by doing it, let s give it like this, okay look, I will run it and hello will come again.Ha Prasa, my problem came only once, let s look at it once, one, two, three, let s see from this, one two, six, six, okay, normal while loop, and if I do the same thing in do while, if I do the same thing in do while, then there will be no difference, but look here, let s see, I run the code of do while, so where did it go, okay, I did not write the back slash here, I am so sorry, so look, the same code has come, is there any difference?No, 1 doti then 4 pa 6 7 89 So usually there is no difference between while and do while loop, just if you have to print it only once like we saw in the previous example of Dval, even if the condition is not hit then it runs once, then Dval is used only for this purpose, rest there is no need to tell anything about it today, let s go ahead, let s come to our important thing which is our Lord.
