f a diagram, then the function does some work for us. First of all, it takes some arguments from us. Arguments, that is, it takes some inputs, the input parameters of these parameters.On the basis, it does some work for us and returns a result to us in the output. Now the major use of functions is inside C or any programming language because it can be used multiple times, meaning we can use the same function again and again. We can press the volume button on the TV remote any number of times or press the button to change the channel or the power button, we have used it millions of times.If you have watched a lot of TV, you must have switched it on and off, then a function is a part that does one thing. With this, the same work can be done as many times as we want. The second property is that it increases code reuse ability.
