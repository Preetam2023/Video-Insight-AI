r string. In fact we can also compare whether one string is smaller or bigger than the other string. How will we compare? We pass two strings inside ATR CMP, a first string and a second string. Now this is the function.It returns an integer, if it returned zero, it means both our strings are equal, so like if we passed hello and also passed hello in the second string, then it means that this is our function will return us, we have zero. Now if it returned any positive value, it means the first string is greater than the second string and it will depend on one of the values. Its example is in the first string we passed banana, in the second string we passed apple, so this one.Now Banana and Apple will return positive values. Whenever we see Esc values, a comes first, then b, then CD. In this way, the S values keep increasing. So in Banana, which is an S value, first of all, the value of b will be compared with a.
