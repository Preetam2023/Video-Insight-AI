e solved by using many arrays, then there we get the benefit of arrays, similarly we use structures.One can ask the benefit, the first benefit of the structure is that it saves us from creating many variables like arrays, now here if we do not create the structure for the student then first of all we would write this s2 roll number, write this s2 roll number, write this s3 roll number on s3 CG, then there would be so many different variables which we would have to declare, then we would not have to declare many variables because structures.The second benefit has come into the picture, this is good data management and organization. Now we know that for every student, name has to be stored, CGPA has to be stored, roll number has to be stored. It is possible that instead of CGPA, percentage can be stored somewhere. Name of parents can be stored for every student.
