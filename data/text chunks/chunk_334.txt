done through it all. Just sometimes recurs helps, sometimes loops help in writing very simple code. Second property is recursion can some times give the most simple solution. Like this, going ahead we will read the data structure of trees. Tree is the data structure of trees, we can read it in C , we can read it in Java, while doing it, we will read the values of the tree.We may not be able to imagine what we are writing right now, but the code of item is very long and the code of complexity is just three lines of code to print all the values, in such cases, Recon helps in writing very simple code. Base case is the condition inside Recon that stops the recon, so the recon is running again and again, it will stop at some place and the condition in which it stops is called that.We have our base case and the fourth property of Recon is that just like we have all the infinities in the item and after that our program will crash.
