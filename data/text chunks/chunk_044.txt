ring, that is, this thing will be printed as it is, but we have to print the number inside its edge.If we want to get the output printed, there are some cases that come up in the process of printing the output. The first case is that whenever we want to print an integer, we have to write it in our print statement. First of all, the sign of percentage and D. This D shows the double value. Double is also a data type. We will be reading about it later. So, sign of percentage and D and after that, as soon as the line ends, we will write comma and then we will write ourThe value of the variable will be printed whenever the whole thing is printed and in place of this percentage d, the value of our edge will come which will replace it. In the same way, if we want to get it done for real numbers, then we will write percentage f and then we will write the variable, then the value of this variable will replace this percentage f.
