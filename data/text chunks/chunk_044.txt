percentage, D and A is ok, so let s see once. This code will run. We can also write it in one line. Remove this print F for one turn and put the condition. If I is divisible by eight, then only write this thing.It s fine here and now print it, see 2 4 6 8 10 God, all the even numbers are printed, the colors are also coming in different colors so that you don t get too confused, this thing is coming here nicely, now blue has come here in P F, it s fine, friend, like I had told you, if we write a statement, then these lines are of no use, we can remove them, very good and I had said one more thing, we can write this here too, okay, one space.Look, if there is only one statement, then write it next to it, then one more line of yours is saved, what have we done, we have put this thing, if I remove it and print it, then the numbers from one to 100 will be printed, but if I put this condition and print it again, then only that number will be printed which is even.
