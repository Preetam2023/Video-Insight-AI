he condition in the recension. Let s run it once again. This is segmentation fault. Program crashes. Why did this happen? If we analyze from above where the call was made, then every time we see that this number which is n was first n then n 1. Then n 2 happened five, fourth happened three happened two happened one happened every time again zero happened every time what we did in the base case was stop at row, this time we removed the condition that stop at zero so this time the values started in negative 1 became 2 became 3 became 4 became 5 and here happened 1 7338 again and in negative and in negative and andIt went negative and negative and became more negative until our program was completely filled and the program crashed. That s why you should never miss the base case at the time of recursion because a lot of issues will be raised then your program will crash. Now let s ask some questions about functions and recurs.
