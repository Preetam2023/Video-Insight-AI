is same roll number then how will we get the same roll number printed? First we had written s1 roll. Now if we want to print it with the help of pointer then what will the star pointer give us? Here the star pointer gives us the value of the pointer like if I have written the star pointer here, asteris pointer or value at address of pointer then this is whatThe value is this is the value of the entire s1, that is, right now I am pointing towards it but I specifically want only the roll number, so with the star pointer I have got the entire s1, now I will put the dot roll in front of it and get its roll number, I hope. This thing will be clear to us that with the star pointer we are getting the points paid on the entire s1 and when we are rolling the dot, we are getting the entire roll number, so this is our entire variable and this is just a way to display a single parameter. Now let s save it and run it.
