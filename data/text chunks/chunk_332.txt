factorial of the new terminal, compile and run, then five.We have got the factorial of 120 printed. Similarly, we can also get the factorial of 4. The factorial of 4 will get printed as 24. Now let us analyze what we have done here in the factorial. In our factorial function, we had to get the factorial of n. What is the simplest way to get it? Find out the factorial of n 1. Who will get it? The same function will get the same function, only the parameters will change in it, after that the factorial of n 1 will be calculated.Let s multiply it with n and we get factorial n. We will return it finally and here also by making a tree structure we can understand completely how things will work. The same thing is going to happen here as we did earlier. We called factorial Pa. He thought first take out factorial f and multiply it by five. Then he called factorial 3. Multiply it by four. Then he called factorial two and multiply it by 2.
