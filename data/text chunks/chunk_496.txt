ter the zero which is 0, our compiler will automatically put it for us. See another example of this.So like we have created a class variable, we have created a class string inside it, we can put our characters differently or we can put them in the form of same words like character class is equal to our college, then here the space will also come to us automatically, that is, we have given space in between, so this space is automatically coming inside our string and the base 0 which is our null character, our compiler will add it. Next we will talk about that whenever weWhen we define a string, what happens inside the memory, that is, we have defined a normal character array and defined a string. What is the difference between these two? What is the difference in the form of memory? Suppose we have defined a string of ours in this format, then what will happen inside the memory? All the blocks that we have taken as characters will be saved.
