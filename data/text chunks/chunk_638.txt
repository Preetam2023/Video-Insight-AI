n, to close, to read characters, to write, or to do many things, but there will be one common thing.That there is F in front of the function of the files so that it can be seen from a distance that it is the function of the file, then to open the file there is a function named f open. It takes two parameters, the first parameter of which is the name of the file. If suppose we have created a file called txt.gz mode, it tells us whether we have to read inside the file or write inside the file or do some other work because our program should know to our system that if we are opening any file then what is it.With what intention are you opening it in this mode because there are some changes at the system level? There are things that have to happen if you have to read, then some things are going on internally at the buffer level which for now we will not go into that much detail.
