unctions. You can convert all the formulas of physics within one function. That is done in the code.When a game is developed and codes are written using C , then how fast will our main character run, what will be his acceleration? What will be the direction of the bullet that is being fired? What will be its coordinates? What will be the coordinates in the aqua plane? What will be the coordinates in 2D plane or 3D plane? All these formulas are written in the form of functions. In the code, functions are very important. In fact, physics is very important. If you want to go into game development, then the next question which is given to us.That is the right function to calculate the percentage of a student. There is a student for whom we have been given marks of three subjects. We have given marks of Science.
