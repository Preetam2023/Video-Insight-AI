, then our 12 is fine, so when the loop will run in 12, as soon as you divide by two, you will know.It seems that a number is divisible, so why should I run the loop further? For three, for four, for five, for six, that is, why should I run the entire loop? It would not make any sense to run the loop from two to 11, from two to 11, so there should be some way by which I can know that I can end the loop by doing tata bye bye. Here we use r for our break statement. This is the break statement. It is used to it is ok.Is used to terminate It is used to terminate Now what is this terminate? Let me do one thing. Let me show you this thing in the code. Once let s do one thing. Let us come to the code and see how the break statement works. So see, I definitely know that as soon as my number is divisible by any number within the same range, then it is a factor of it. See, it being zero means that it is a factor of.
