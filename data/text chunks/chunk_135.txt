we have to check for one number that it is greater than nine and that same number is less than 100. These are both the conditions. Both the conditions should be true. We will put our logical AND operator in between and then we will print one instead of true. Now we can say this in a way that we are going to write the condition for writing the statement.So that we check whether it is a two digit number or not, the number which is greater than nine and less than 100 will always be a two digit number, so whenever we have to check the condition of a two digit number, we write this statement in our code, then whenever such a question comes, we have to print this same statement. Inside that question, first of all we write the code for it. Let s define a variable and then print it on the screen. Enter the number. Get the number entered. Then we will calculate the percentage of that number.
