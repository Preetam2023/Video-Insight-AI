10. If it is not there, then the loop is not running, so this is our concept of garbage value here.Error has not come, this thing gives error in Java c c p, here there is a concept of garbage value, that means we can say random, random value is ok, we will give some random number to j, it will get a random number here, okay now it is possible that garbage can be inside w, we can also get zero value to j, ok, c can be any number, it is not necessary that the dirty number that you see.It is 3375 8, it can be any number, so if there was zero here, what would have been the scene, is zero smaller than 10? Yes, zero would have been printed, then zero would have become our one. Do you understand that in some cases, our answer may depend on the value, J may get garbage value, my five is fine, so it will be written here, is five smaller than 10, yes, print the value of five, then print six.Look, then seven will be printed. 9, 10, finally, 11 will not be printed.
