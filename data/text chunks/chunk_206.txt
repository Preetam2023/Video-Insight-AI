cter.We can also take it as int, we can also take double, it depends on what problem we are solving. The next thing we will talk about is int with infringing i 1. Our condition is done. Now here is our termination condition and you thought that you will leave it blank here, that means we will not write any statement here which will terminate this loop and here we will write our update statement i.e. i p and every time.What is this loop doing? Every time this loop is printing it, we have Hello World, let s save it. So what does this loop say that the value of i is starting from one, every time the value of a is increasing, that is, first there is one, then it will become two, then it will become three, then it will become three, then it will become four, then it will become five. But here we have left this statement blank as per our wish, we can leave any of the three blank. The problem is this.Errors come and what errors come. Now we will see.
