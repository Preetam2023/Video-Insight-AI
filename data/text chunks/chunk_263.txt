ello. If it prints the average of two numbers, then we could have named it average or print average.We could have named our function according to whatever work it does, so here we named it print hello and after writing the function, two parentheses are always required, so we put two parentheses here, after that we put the statement terminator. Now this is what we have written as void. Writing this void means that our function will not return anything in the result, that is, it will do the work but we will not get any value at the end, that is why we have void void.In English it means empty, so void is written here, meaning this print hello function will print hello but will not return any value. Now this line which is print hello, before that void and then the parenthesis, this tells the compiler that one of our functions exists. This is the syntax of the declaration. The second syntax that we are talking about is the definition of the function.
