Okay, so friend, look at this code once here.Let s go one by one what is happening, my product right now is one, here we write the values of the product, so my product is one for now and the value of my i is also one for now, okay here we go inside the loop for n i 1 i n n let s say mine is my friend f or our five is yes okay so is one less than my five just ahead go inside the loop product is equal to product is equal to current product myOne is into come what is i also mine is also one so the value of the product is now one so one is stored back in it cut one is stored but only one is stored then my i p so the value of i becomes my 2 ok then we move ahead i 1 i n is 2 n less than 5 exactly man go ahead inside so product is equal to current product value is my one and value of i is my twoNow instead of product, 2 is stored, the value of the product is 1 2, so here we have our 2, then i is also our look at 1, it has become th, then
