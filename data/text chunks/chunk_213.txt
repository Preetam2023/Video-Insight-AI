6 WhenTill 10 is not reached, now what will be the way to do this? First of all, we will take value input from the user. We took the value input from the user, stored it in some variable n, stored it in the number n. Now whenever we used to write the for key condition or what do we do in this case, we solve the question with while loop. Earlier, whenever we used to write the condition of while, what will we write inside the while until our i equal to n. First we used to write lesson.Equal to 5, in this case n is a changing number, it cannot always be five, it can be four, it can be 10, it can be 10000 also, then lane equal n, inside that we will print our i and later we will make it i p, so our process will be something like this, let us code it and check it, then write above, print F, enter number and make your number above, define int n and scan from here.Now we will write our while loop while while one iter r int i e as long as our i equal to n then our while loop will run.
