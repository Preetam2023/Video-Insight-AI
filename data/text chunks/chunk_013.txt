function doing? This welcome function is calling hello, so if it wants, it can call complete hello. Here also we write self. Now we are telling the person that the person can say welcome but can never say hello. Welcome but can say hello because it is a method of internal class. So this is the way things work, so p1 now.What will p1 do? Now it will call welcome because it is possible to do this and welcome will be calling self dot hello for that. We will not get any error in this call. Let s save it and run it. So what is printed, we have hello person and we do not get any error. So how are things working? Things are working in such a way that if we make something private with double underscore, then it can be accessed only by those of the class.Only those which are internal functions will be able to access them, no one outside will be able to access them. This is basically done to prevent exposing our instance entity outside side of the class.
