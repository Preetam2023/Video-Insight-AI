. It is written as P .Now what we will do inside this file is that we will write a sample code of C. From this code, we will understand how easy it is to write C and it is not as big a thing as people tell us. Programming coding is a very easy thing. It is very easy. Inside this we will write some things which we will not understand right now but as soon as Chapter One is completed, all the things will become clear. So here we are going to write some things which maybe alien language.It may look like std add a int main print f hello world return row. Now here we have written hello world. Now this is the sort of convention that whatever new programming language you learn, the first code in it is the rule of the coding world that the first code you have to write is hello world, so we have written its code. The function of this code is that it will print hello world on the screen, so let s see how we save it and any C code.
