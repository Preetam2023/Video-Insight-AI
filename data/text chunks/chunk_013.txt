, let s talk about this code that we have written, for in e 1 i e lane equal to 0, okay I have less.Made equal to 0, hey man, let s write something good here, man, for a second, we delete it and come here in the code, I write five once, if we write five times, then look, it gets printed five times, okay, so I will explain the meaning, what is happening, okay, here we see the meaning with command shift four, okay, now let s look at this code once, where did it go, oh yes, here is the code, okay this.Let s look at the code once, what is there in it and understand the internal meaning that if I just change this small number and use it, it will be printed seven times. Let s see why this is happening. Here we have three things which we can call three conditions. We can call three things, I color them differently. First of all I have written int a iv, then man I have written a i len equ t 5 and then I have written a i e i 1 Let s understand the meaning of these three individually.
