ntinue exploration of six there is nothing adjacent to six so go back to five from five where I can go further so I can visit two which is already completed right I can visit eight which which is already completed so there is nothing remaining for five so what happens in this way is we are going deep and deep right so in this way almost all vertices are visited only they are completely explored so five is completely explored go back to the previous vertex who is that seven seven from Seven where I can go from Seven I can go on two which is already visited then go back to 8 from 8 nothing is remaining so from two where I can go I can go to one right then nothing is remaining so go back to four from four I cannot go anywhere from three one I cannot visit anywhere so that s all right so here is the def for search traversal result and this is a DFS spanning tree this is depth for search spanning tree and these edges are called called as back edges so for this graph we can make a tree like
