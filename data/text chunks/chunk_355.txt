, after which all the questions should be easily solved. We will be covering all the basic concepts. We will take some questions which form the core of programming, so we will solve the questions well and along with that, we will also give some practice.We will also ask questions like whether the topic of points will get stuck in the mind, let us start with points. Points means a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Usually what happened was that we used to create any one variable inside the memory.
