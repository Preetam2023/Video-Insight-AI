we want to print not adult, then what will we do, we will write else in this way and then also that.We will make a block of curly braces, whatever lines are there in between the curly braces, we call it a block of curly braces. If we complete our print F here, then we will write not adult in the next line and save it. Now here we could write multiple lines also. Now if he is an adult, then obviously we know that he can vote. If he is 18, he will be able to vote. If he is 18, he can also drive.If found then we write here can drive also so in this way if this condition is true then all the three statements will be printed and if the condition is not true then there is only one statement in this block.
