is happening, here pe is becoming 2 and so on in is 2, we have to print up to n terms n means user.Maybe I have to print 20 such terms in the same pattern in the same manner, so again it is very simple, how friend, how will you do it, there are two ways to do it. One thing we can do is that we can find out the same mathematical condition of ours. Can we find the jeep s term in mathematics? We will find a term which is a r n 1. Again friend, this is a formula, r is the common ratio whichThat here is two is being multiplied by two, then you will say that the first term is the common ratio of our two and n 1, so the power of 2 is n 1, what is this my friend, this is going to be my eighth term but we will have to take it out, so this is a big problem, how will we write it in the condition, we have not studied all these things, okay, so again here my friend, the basic which we learned in coding.
