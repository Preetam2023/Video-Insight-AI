where the value of d is being assigned but not to e. We can also check this by writing in the code. Int d We have given one but whatever e is is.If no value is given then this will also be a valid statement. Now let us see some examples of invalid statements inside c like if we create a variable old age. Now inside the old age variable if we store a value which is 22 and then we create a new variable new age. Let us make new age old age plus years i.e. how many years have passed. So here the old age variable is already there but there is no years. Now suppose we are going to declare the years also. Int years is equal to 2. What is going to be our new age after 2 years. Now years, we have told inside the code that its value is 2, still why is the red line coming here because we have used it before telling the years, so before declaring the variable when we use it.If you use it then it gives an error inside s i.e.
