he parameter will make a copy of this argument and all the changes that happen inside this function.Changes take place in the copy, it is similar to that if your message remains the same, then after receiving the message, your friend can do anything with it, he can forward it, delete it, save it, but the message will not change from my side, I will have the message as it is, so what we have is the main function and the friend is our square function. Whatever we do with the square function parameters, he can take the parameters of the main function as arguments.That s why the value of the number remains the same, but if I say that we can pass the variable in a different way in which it is possible to change the value, then it will be a different type of function call, then by default the behavior is that the copy is passed to us. We call this concept call by value, which means we pass the value of our argument as argument.
