ter is also called formal parameter. These are some differences which you can remember a little bit. It is very important to remember because whenever we learn a language, we have to remember some things because whenever we learn something new.The code will appear in front of you. Syntax which are the concepts of basic programming, we have to remember them. Later on, when there are big problems, we can solve them with logic, like in A B C D, we have to remember how we used to write A B C D. We used to practice writing again and again. Similarly, right now we are learning the A B C D of our C. We have to remember this A B C D. Now there are some notes regarding the functions, first of all.Function can only return one value at a time. In a function like parameters, you can write 100. Here inside the sum, we have also takenReflect the values in calling function. Let s first look at it with an example because if we look at this statement, we will see the complexity.
