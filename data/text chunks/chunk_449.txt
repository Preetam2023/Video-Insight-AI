xample. Suppose you have created an array named Aadhaar which stores the Aadhaar cards of 10 people. Now for that you have to put a loop which will input the Aadhaar values of 10 people and thenIf we give the Aadhaar of 10 people in the output, then make a pointer for it. Where is the pointer pointing at the first index? So our pointer here is pointing at this location and in all the indexes, we have stored our values, so for the 10 values, we have created our entire array and named it Aadhaar. Now we have made a pointer which is pointing at the first location. Now what will this pointer do? First of all, the first location.But whatever value is there, it will be printed, then we will do pot pointer plus plus, then it will come to the second location, it will print the value here, then again we will do pointer plus plus, then it will come to the third location, it will print the value here, then again plus plus will come here, it will print the value. So in this way, we can run a loop.
