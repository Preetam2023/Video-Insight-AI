find out, assume any number, we have to find fina of two, this is fina of zero, this is fina of one.This is Fina of two This is Fina of three This is Fbo of four And so on So to find Fbo of two we can say Fina of plus Fbo of and Fina of three If we have to find it, then we can call it It is Fbo of w plus Fbo of two Fbo of fur If we have to find it, then we can also call it Fina of 2 PS Fina of 3 So from this we get the common function if any numberIf we want to find the fina of n then it is one number two numbers before it plus the number two before that i.e. fina of n 1 phonechi of n 2. In a way we have derived the recursion formula to write our recursion function that fina, make a function which calculates fina for n. Now we do not know the one of n but maybe he knows the one of n 1 and n 2. We are so confident that it will find out both of them.So call both of them. After calling both of them, add both of them and store them in fina of n.
