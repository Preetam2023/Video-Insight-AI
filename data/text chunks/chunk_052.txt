ich has come to us, now we will print it. Print F to sum is percentage d. Sum. Let s save this code. What did we do inside it? We created two variables a and b. First of all, enter a, then we got a entered and we used it as the name of that variable.Stored it in the memory location, after that b was entered. It was stored in the memory location of b. After that, a new variable called sum was created inside which the final value obtained by adding a and b was stored. After that, we printed the value of the sum. Now open our terminal and analyze its output. First of all, we will enter the value of a, then enter two, then enter the value of b.If there is five, then we have the sum in the output is seven. In this way, two and five are summed and then seven is printed. Now here we are going to learn a small trick. Here we have created a third variable sum, so we remove it and what we will do directly is by removing this sum, we will write here a b and save it and run our code once again.
