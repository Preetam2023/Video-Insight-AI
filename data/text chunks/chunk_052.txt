the last term. Now, what is our 10th term? Well, we can directly calculate it from the formula here. If this is my 10th term, then I directly say, what will be the 10th term 2 10 1 i.e. 20 1 19 which we can also see 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 and see 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 So 10th turn our term is our 19 is coming, such a term will be 2n 1 so simple if we have to write the question here which we create a new file of this, go inside the loops and create a new file A odd is okay dot C so here also we write all the things off course this time I am going to copy paste the things II will not write again and again, everything is ok, first of all we create an end box, then we write print f and here we write enter a number, then we write scanf and we take input of our number, which is our number, we write end n here, then we go ahead and how will we write our code here, now see what we need here, our initialization condition and increment, so we can see this series.
