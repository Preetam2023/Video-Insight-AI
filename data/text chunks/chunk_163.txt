day, three means Wednesday and so on. We have asked the user to enter the number of days till seven. Here we can write from one to sen and then we will write here and day. Then we will write our switch inside the switch. This is just that you are coding inside VS Code, so once youPress enter, all the things which are written will come, but since we are writing for the first time, we will write from the beginning. After the switch, we start the parens, whoever we have to check, inside the parens, we will write the variable, we have to check whom, we have to check the day, then we will put curly braces. Now inside this block, we will write all the statements. First of all, we will write case one. What does case one say that whatever our day is, it is Monday, so we have written Monday, now after this we will break in the same way.
