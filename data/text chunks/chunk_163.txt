te our code, so first of all, suppose I have a number int n and I will take its input from the user.I will write print f enter enter a number then I will go here and take an input from scanf so the percentage d a and n 7n is not coming and n is ok and then now I will run my loop because what do I have to do friend pay attention come back here I first of all have to keep dividing it by 10 again and again as soon as I divide by 10 then add one to the count count e equal to count the first one is plus.Add one, okay or we can also write it as count plus plus, so we know that both these statements will be there but we have to put a loop because it has to happen again and again, I don t know how many times it has to happen because the number is my answer, okay, so here first of all we create an int count, we initialize our int count from zero, now here we are going to use the while loop because what is our condition, let s come back here.
