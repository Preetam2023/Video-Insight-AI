same code with for instead of while. How to do it here. Comment out and write the same code in for. For int aa 0 aa.Until the value of i is less then equal to n, we have n. Here we will write our print statement percentage d n aa. So just like here the value of aa was the first row and the condition was being checked here, similarly in the for loop the value of i is the first row. We have put the condition until i n and for update i p and every time we are printing the value of i then thisNow let s save it once and run it. Now after entering the number, we have six, so all the numbers from row to six have been printed. Now suppose we do not want to do it from zero. We have to print it from one to six. No problem, take the value of this i as initialism. If we want to print it from three to six or from three to seven, from three to n, then do the initialization statement. Get it done from three to n, then in any way in this way.
