omes the last fi. Now checked whether fi is less than fi or five. Yes, but after this the loop ends.If it becomes i6 then the value of the product is the current product is 24 and these 5 are 120 so the product is stored in place of 120 and i is plus i is the value of i is g then move ahead i 6 lane equal 5 no loop over finished product our finally 120 is stored in it we got it printed simple dry run let s move ahead and do the next question this is your homework this is a very good questionI am going to give you a little idea and hint about it. Print the factorials of first a numbers means friend, suppose my n is 5, then I have to print it and show it line by line. Look, you have to print how much is the factorial of n, friend, there is only one, factorial of n is 2 n, that is, 2, so you have to show t, factorial of 3 is friend, our 3 2 1, so you have to print this.You also have to print the factorial of 3, then the factorial of 4.
