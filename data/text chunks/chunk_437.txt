pointer was currently 2000 and now we have made the pointer plus plus, then its value will increase. So this pointer which is 2004 will now start pointing here and not here because this memory is taking ultimately four bytes and the address of this memory location is also 2004 and the address of this memory location is 1996 so from here intuitively we can understand that if we did plus plus then it will move forward by one integer i.e. it will move forward by four bytes and if we did PTR minus minus then those four bytes.It will go back i.e. 2004, after that we again make the pointer minus minus, then it will come back to its original location that is 2000. Now let s verify it once by coding it. Inside our program, create a variable int age 22 and then create the pointer PTR by storing it inside PTR as the address of age. Now we have done this, first of all let s make PTR plus plus plus plus here.
