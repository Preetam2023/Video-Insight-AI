nction is the same, meaning the work we are trying to do here and the work we are trying to do here. What we are trying to do is the same thing, there is just a slight difference in it, we just have to add a value, so what does this function do? It is calling itself, calling itself, we are able to see that first it is calling for n, then it is calling for n 1, then it is calling for n 2, then it will be calling for n 3 until we reach here n 1, this is our last.Now Rickson too will call himself somewhere but he can call himself up to a limit, not how many times he has to call himself. If you want to find the sum of n numbers then you have to call n times and who will track these calls? These calls will be tracked by our parameters because in the parameters, just as we had reduced the count to zero by decreasing the value of count, similarly here we have decreased the value of n by first five, then four, then three again.
