bar sl 0 that we have shown. This is a null character. Like we write back sl a, it means next line. If we write back sl, it means tab space, then back sl means zero.What we have talked about till now is that we have characters inside C and what a character does is it stores a single letter or a single symbol but suppose we have to store a word, then how should we store the word or how should we store a sentence, there the strings come into our picture.What do strings do? The words in English or the sentences or paragraphs, we can store them in the string data type. Now it will be a normal character array. Suppose we have created a character array named, inside it we will define a few things like A.B.C. These three characters are written inside it. So we will call it a character array on the character array in which if we add a null character in the last, then it will show that it is A.B.C.
