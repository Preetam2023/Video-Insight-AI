ions are very powerful like the functionIf we talk in simple language or in the language which you will write in your exam, then function is a block of code that performs a particular task, that is, a function is a block of our program, it is a part which performs a particular task and for the sake of simplicity, the work of a function is only one, like if there is a function which has to increase the volume, then it will only increase the volume, it will not reduce the volume or it will not change the channel.Whose job is to mute the TV, it will just mute the TV, it will neither increase nor decrease the volume. In this way, every function of C has one task and it does the same work. We do not try to get it to do other tasks, otherwise our program becomes complex. Now if we understand the function with the help of a diagram, then the function does some work for us. First of all, it takes some arguments from us.
