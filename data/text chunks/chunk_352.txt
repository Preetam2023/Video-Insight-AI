so they have been printed twice. If we talk about three also, then three will be printed once here. Three will be printed here, that is why fina will be printed as many times as the call is being made, so two second term is our one, third.Our term is two. Second term is called again. One, so this is a little complex. Let s run it once again and solve it. So the final of six is eight. Once again we have created the sequence and write the sequence. The sequence is like this 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 This is the required term. This is the first, this is the second, this is the third, this is the fourth, this is the fifth, this is the sixth term.That s right, we only have eight in our FINA sequence, so this is our code to write our sequence and we have written this code in a very simple way. There should be no problem at all. We have understood a complex FINA very well. Now remember this because a lot of FINA questions are asked before you.
