all the integer values. If you take equal to five floats then by default 0.0.0 will be stored in it. So whenever you have to take memory dynamic and assign null values i.e. zero values in it then simply what to use is to use calc. The syntax to define it is that we simply write calc and like before we write bytes.This time we used to send, this time we will not send the total number of bytes. This time we will send how many locations we need. Number of locations and what is the size of para location. So the para location size we need is equal to one integer and five int eras we need the location. What we used to do earlier was to sell the total number of bytes. So we would multiply both of them. This time we will not do that. This time we have to send different parameters and then it will also return us void pointer void pointer.Type cast to integer pointer and now with the help of this PTR we can access the memory and assign values in it. We can print its values.
