There can be multiple ways to do this.You can also do this same question with the help of Continue. You can also do the same question in the reverse way i.e. in the way I will show you, there are multiple ways to do the same question with opposite conditions and when we are in the initial stage of programming then we must explore multiple ways. We have done one question in one way, now we have to try it in another way, first this is this. I had checked Qual to is equal to , now I try to solve the question by saying Not equal to . Whenever we do programming in this way, in the beginning, our creativity and logical power increases a lot because we are imagining multiple cases along with the same situation. When at the time of placement or at the time of college, you might have been given a coding question, what would be your corner cases in it?You will be able to imagine the condition statements very well where your code can get stuck. So let s move inside the question.
