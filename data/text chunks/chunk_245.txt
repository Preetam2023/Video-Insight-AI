once again in which we will have to write a few things. Okay, no one, first we would take a number.Int a is okay and then we also write int b right here, let s write int a b two here, I made boxes, I wrote print F, write P here friend, enter base base means the bottom number, expo ant means the top number, so enter base here, then we took it enter scan a percentage d and write here our end a a, I am assuming that I copy and paste my base similarly, friend and write here enter exponential power that.How much is the power of two and we are storing it in B, that is the number of powers, now what do you have to write here, take a new variable, this power or anything int C, you can also take it from one for one turn, that is why we are converting it from one, not from zero, because you will multiply zero with anything, here the power is being multiplied again and again, so it will become zero, okay, our power has become one, and now we have to run the loop loop here.
