e numbers of decimals inside the float which are always to be printed, so we have printed them here. Now you must be thinking that.How is the execution key of this statement coming again and again? So, on your keyboard, you have the arrow keys. You can press the upper key, then you can go to the old commands. So, you will not have to write the entire statement again and again to execute it. You can directly execute it by pressing that key. Now in a similar way, if we want to print a character, suppose we have created a character, a star, which is of the star variable.Name is and Asteris has been stored inside it, then we will write here Star is, Percentage C will come here and Star will come here, we save it and run it, the output comes to us as Stars Ast disk, so in this way we can get our different types of data printed on our screen. Now the next concept which is a very important concept of this language is our input. To take the input inside C, we use a function.
