or fp4 is a kana name for us, we will use F PTR so that there is some distinction that it is normal.The pointers of variables are PTR and we are calling the pointers of the file as FPTR, so first of all we create this FPTR inside our code. We will write FILE which means our file type and after that we will write star f patti aa, so what have we done about the file type, we have declared a pointer to FPTR. Now how to use this pointer, that is, how will it open the files, then to open the file and to close it,If we talk about syntax, first of all let s talk about opening the file, once we have created F PTR, after that we have a function named F Open. Now mostly we will discuss the functions of files, there will be an F in front of them, which makes it very clear that a file has a function, whether it is to open, to close, to read characters, to write, or to do many things, but there will be one common thing.
