it greater than zero, go exactly inside the loop r r n mud 10 so r eNow current r is mine 40 n mdl 10 so r 3 mdl 10 ok that will be my 40 p 13 mdl 10 is 3 i.e. 43 so my value is stored inside aa now 43 then r r multiply these 10 aa further by 10 and further divide n by 10 friend so n becomes 12 go back in the loop.Is 12 greater than zero? Yes, of course. So this is my pho p 2, so the value of r becomes 432. Then I multiplied r by 10, here it becomes 4320. Then I divided my n by 10, so n becomes mine. From here n, now go back. Is one greater than zero? Go inside exactly. r r प n.Mud 10 then add 1 mud 10 to 4320 so that is only one so one is added to 4320 so it becomes 432 1 then r e r 10 Problem 43 210 n n ba 10 Now the value of n is zero.
