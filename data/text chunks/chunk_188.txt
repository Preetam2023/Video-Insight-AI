s in the for loop is the first condition that comes in the parentheses, we call this initialization.Condition means for any work we will be starting from here like if we have to print Hello World five times then we will take a variable which will track how many times Hello World has been printed then the value of that variable can start from our row can go up to four or the value of that variable can start from one and can go up to five so what will that variable do like we can take a variable i and what this i will do is the first of all.If the value is one, then it will count one, then two, then two, then three, then four, then five, and as soon as one occurred, Hello World was printed. As soon as two occurred, Hello World was printed. Three, Hello World were printed. Four, Hello World were printed. In five, it also printed Hello World. Now its initial value is i 1. This statement is the initialization statement which comes here.Our condition can be second.
