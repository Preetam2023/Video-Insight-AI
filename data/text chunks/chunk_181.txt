y that every character has its own integer which is associated with it and is known to the compiler.If it is an integer, then either we can directly compare the character with a value like writing character is greater than equal to 97 and character is greater than equal to a, this means the same for the compiler, so either you write this line or this line, there will be no difference, so here we are going to compare with capital a, so capital a has one value.65 And and C is less than equal to capital G. S kai value of capital G is 90 so it keeps increasing i.e. it will be of capital A which will be 65 then capital B of 66 capital C of 67 it keeps increasing in this way if our character is bigger than thisIn American English we say ji then we have to print F then we have to print F in upper case, in this case we will write upper case otherwise in else else let s check one more case that sich is our if sich if our greater than equal tool is A and and C is our lesson is equal to sloppy th
