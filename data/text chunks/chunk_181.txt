y because n is second lastIf you need a digit, okay, then I will divide it by 10, so it becomes 123. Okay, now the second thing, now I need r, which is 4321, so for one turn, let us concentrate on how I can make r 43. How can I make 43, tell me one thing, 43 is 40 3, which is my 4 10 3, so I cannot add this 3 just like that.I will do this, then it will be the sum of digits, which I have done, I will do one thing, first I will make this four, okay, first I will make four, my 40, then I will add its last digit to it, here I will make it 43, again I will divide n by 10 and make it 12, okay now again 43, I have r, now let s try to make r 432, okayHow to make 432? 432 is 430 2. Okay, it is 43 10 2. So again my first task will be to multiply it by 10, I have become 430, then I will add its last digit to it, then it will become 432 and again by dividing it by 10, I will make it one. Again, I have 432 lying with me, I have 43 2.
