efinition, it is a collection of similar data types, that is, you can store three ints or five ints.Only two ints and one float can be stored together, five floats can be stored together, five characters can be stored together, but different data types cannot be stored together in the form of a collection. Stored at Contiguous Memory. Lock Continuum means continuous, so this data is stored inside the memory in a continuous fashion, that is, it is stored one after the other, so it becomes easy to access it, so whenever we have multiple variables.If we have to store them, then instead of giving them different names, we create an array, like if you see an example of this, by writing it in the code, suppose we have to store the marks of three students, then if we do not have any structure like an array, then we would normally be creating three variables, int marks one, we will store physics marks in it, then int marks two, we will store chemistry marks in it and then int marks th.
