tion. Print sum of a is percentage d sum d x and sum for our component sum of y is sum dva put here.Let s give a bus and call inside the main function, pass the calculate sum to the calculate sum v1 v2 and our sum vector save and run, so in v1 we passed 5 aa cap 10 h cap, in v2 we passed 3 aa cap 7 h cap so what is the sum?Actually, here we do not understand how to use them well, when we initially learn the concept, suppose you are making a shooter game, C and C are very similar, just like there are structures inside C , similarly we can create classes, they do not exist inside C, so when you read C , or Java, then we will know what a class is, but the structure is similar, there when we create a game.When we use C P in development, many times what we have to do is to define the velocity.
