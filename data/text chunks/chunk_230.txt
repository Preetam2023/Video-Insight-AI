performing these three steps again and again, now let s look back once, okay, I have put B inside A.After putting the value, I removed the u and put the value of 3 , inside b , after removing the value of b , I put the value of f and in the sum, I put the sum of these two, 8. Okay, now when you see all these things again, you will release something or the other, put the value of b back inside b , put the value of sum inside the sum, 5 , 8, 13, again, back inside a we putWe put 8 inside B, we put 13, inside even, the sum of these two is 21. Now just notice the even variable for one turn. We are running this again and again, isn t the loop going on? Why is this because it has to be done in the loop itself, when we are doing this thing again and again? We have executed this thing many times till now, so this is 2 3 5 8 13 21. The next one will definitely be 34.
