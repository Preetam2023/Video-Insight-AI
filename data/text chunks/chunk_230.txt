user gave us 42 So we will have to print the table of 42 which obviously I will not be able to do quickly. So what we have done till now is that we have written a for loop inside which we have told our condition i 1 i e n i and inside that what we used to do was print our i. We used to print i by printing i but this time we will not print aa. This time we will be performing some other function and what will be the function like for 2 we will also write 2 malla ba 1.We can write 4 as 2 Malla Ba 2. We can write 6 as 2 Ma Ba 3 because what is the whole of this table of two? Now let s see one thing, here this two is remaining constant but this is our variable, it is increasing, first there was one, then there was two, then 3 4 5 in the next 6 7 8 9 10 so this value is increasing.Obviously this number will not be our iterator. This number will be our iterator. It is the number whose value keeps changing and keeps getting updated. So, this number will be our iterator.
