our keywords. Apart from this, character is also one of our keywords and these are all the keywords. Now we will explore them somewhere in our entire course, then we will know which are the keywords. That s why whenever we see in our program, we have this int written, this int has a special meaning which is known only to the compiler.So, we should not name any variable as int. This is return. Return is also a keyword. We should not name any variable as return because these are special words whose meaning is fixed, which is known to the compiler. Now once we understand the structure of our program, how can we actually understand the code that we are writing? How can we actually understand how it is made? Just like the human body has a skeleton, similarly every code has a structure for every program.What happens is that if we talk about the structure of our C program, then our program looks something like this. This is our initial code which we have written.
