It has no value outside here. Similarly, the value of our i is not outside this for loop, okay, but.We can do a work around for this, which is very important to tell here, if I create a box here, write i 1, I create my box outside int aa, now what is the difference in this that I did both the things, it will give the same result, once we remove it, let s just talk about it, i, here I wrote int aa aa 1, then hello world is going to be printed five times, my look here too, okay once again you are plus.Let s do this and write here f, so look, I have written a normal for loop here, so look, it is going to print here five times, hello world, this is a small one, look here, this is going to print our hello world only five times. Okay, if instead of aa, I write sis here, then this is going to print our hello world six times here. Right, if instead of this, see what is the difference, then if I remove this and write this, then also the same work will be done, but the same.
