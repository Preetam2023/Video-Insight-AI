address of ptr. Now we do not have both of these but we have this only with the help of this ppt r.If you want to get your number five printed, how will you get it printed, let s understand it a little with the help of a diagram. First of all, assume that you have There is a variable Aa which is stored at a memory address inside which the value is stored. Our five. Apart from that you have PPT R. There is an address stored inside PPT R. PTR also has an address stored inside it. Its address was suppose 2000. 2000 is stored inside PTR. Its address was 2010. So inside PPT R, 2010 is stored and its address is 2020.Some variation of this method is going on. Now whenever the value has to be calculated, first of all a bell should ring in our mind and we should remember an operator. Which is the value at address operator i.e. our est risk. Whenever the value has to be calculated, the est risk has to be remembered. Whenever the value has to be calculated, M percentage has to be remembered.
