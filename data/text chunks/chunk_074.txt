applying a little maths, but apart from that, I will teach you a work around, 100 3, that is, n 33.3, so the maximum value of n can be 33, meaning like there will be 33 such terms which will be positive, once we check and see in the computer, if I runOkay, once I run again, enter a number written here, I write 33, then look, 100 97 94 and so on up to 4. Okay, but if I do 32 instead of 33 here, okay look, enter a number, I put here 30 4, then I run, then all these things came to 100 97 94 91 up to 1, and if I instead of n,If I print 35, I got one 2. So, I understood that the value of n here means how many times I print the loop till it comes positive, then I got that number here. 34 Okay, here I might have made a small mistake. Probably yes, look at this, I have made a very small mistake. 103 3n was there, then see why my answer came wrong. Leave it.
