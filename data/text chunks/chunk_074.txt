k about invalid in the right hand side, then a is in the right hand side and our b c is in the left. Now if we were studying math, then this would be a correct statement according to math, but here for us this statement is a completely wrong statement. This statement is telling the compiler to take the value of a and store it in b c whereas b c is not a single variable because if single variable is not written on the left hand side then the statementWhat goes completely wrong is that once we write it in the code, like if we write int b c a, now there is a red line here because this statement is wrong because on the left side we should have only one variable inside which the value is stored but here if we reverse it i.e. write a here and write b c here then it will be correct but above we have to define b and c, we write b c 1, so now this statementIt will be absolutely correct because all the variables are defined and on the left side we have written only a.
