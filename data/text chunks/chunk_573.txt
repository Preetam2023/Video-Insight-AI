we created an array of integer type, then 1 2 3, these three are our memory.Key locations are saved. Similarly, when we create a structure, whatever data types we define inside it, according to those data types, there are some areas inside our memory which get stored, that too in contiguous fashion, i.e. continuously, just as there are blocks one after the other inside the array, similarly here too there are contiguous memory locations, like if we created a student structure in which first of all we kept a character array for a string, then first of all it is equal to a string.The memory location will be stored with us to which we will give a name. Now inside the name, all the characters that we want to store in our name string will be stored.
