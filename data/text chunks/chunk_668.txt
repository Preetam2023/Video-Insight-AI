age again. Again we entered the marks. This time our file was already created whose name is student. If we open student then now our data has come to us in this format first name then age inside the next line then CGPA inside the next line then different ways. If we have to do formatting while writing inside the file then we can do that also. Next let s do our question number 63.Our question says, write a program to write all the odd numbers from one to n in a file, that is, we have to create a file and inside it all the odd numbers from one to n. Come here, we have to write in it and whatever n is, this n will be given to us by our user. So the user will input n and run a loop from one to n. We will extract the number d and write it inside the file. So let s close it. There is a new file inside our program and try to open it. Right se f ptr it f open the name of our file odd dt xt end and we are opening it in write mode.Even if it does not exist, it will be created automatically.
