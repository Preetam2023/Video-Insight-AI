tten, it came with six, it was written again with 7 8 9 10 11, then I tried dividing by 7 8 9 10 11.12 did not come, so it came four times, as soon as I write break, what happens in one turn, the whole loop ends, after that the loop does not run, after that it does not get repeated, no further rounds of the loop come, so this is a very wonderful thing, loop here, if I now write 12, then it will be written only once, the given number is composite, similarly, if I run a, sorry, once I write here this break.Let s blow up the statement. I run it once and I write here that 24 will be written many times. Why is it being written so many times? These are factors of 24 other than 12, 24 is divisible by two, is divided by three. Look, the first is divisible by two, 24 is also divided by th, it is also divisible by four, then it is also divisible by six, then it is also divisible by eight and it is also divisible by 12, okay.
