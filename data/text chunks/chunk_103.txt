he topic of If Else. Inside the Loop Control, we will read about the different different loops in C. Like our for loop, our while loop, we will read different loops, that is, if we have to do any task repeatedly.We have to do the same thing again and again by using some lines. We use loop control instruction in it. When we have to take a decision whether it is raining today, whether we should take an umbrella or not, whether it is sun and it is Sunday, will we be happy or not today? There are some such decisions. Whenever we write them in the code, we write them with the help of decision control instructions. After that, last comes we have case control instruction inside whichAccording to some cases, we do different things like if it is Monday to Friday then we have to go to work and if Sunday comes then we do not go to work then we have to sit at home and take rest.
