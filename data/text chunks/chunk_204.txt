s way, you will have to write plus n 2, it will give a different answer, he will give me the answer.Do you understand what I am saying? If I directly write n 2 instead of this, then the answer will be wrong because my answer is not th, my answer is 4 3 7. Okay, let s code it once and let me explain to you, what I want to say is that we have put such a big pay for loop here, it is not needed, let s remove it. Simply check, is my n divisible by two? If so, then brother, it is simple.What do you do in the sum, friend, let us write here the value of our sum will be n ba 2 simple answer will come and later if you print it then n ba 2 is ok brother it is over otherwise else if my number is odd then the value of the sum will come in the even n ba 2 will definitely come one is fine then plus one will be n separately and of course bud mass will be calculated so this thing is going to be calculated first friend after that it will be added.
