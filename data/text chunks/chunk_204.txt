ounter in the loop, which was a counter variable, can also be a float, it can also be our character. How, for example, we write a loop in which we want to print numbers from one to five, but this time, if we want to print floating numbers, then we will start the value of i from 1.0 and till i till ourLane is not equal to 5.0. Here we will make i plus plus and every time we will print the value of percentage f s n aa, save it and open a new terminal and run it, so what we print is 1.00 2.00 3.0 4.0 and this is In this way 5.0 means this time all the value has been printed in the slot and this time the iterator that we have used as our counter variable is a floating value along with it, suppose we have to print the characters from a to z, then what will be its loop, in the beginning we will take the character iterator i a, what will we do after that, will we put the condition or here instead of i, this time we take a different variable, if we take s, then i inside the character.
