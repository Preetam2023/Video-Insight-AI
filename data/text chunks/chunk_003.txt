have uh values with the non zero values like one two zero point one like that then that kind of features are called dense features okay so in this kind of scenario the same learning rate will not give you the good optimization that means it will not reach the convergence Point faster so we need a different learning rate for each and every Epoch or iteration by adapting the learning rate to each and every parameter available in the input features so the other grid is using low Landing rates for the parameters which are associated with the frequently occurring features but which is using High Learning rates for parameters which are associated with infrequently occurred features are rare features so when we are using different learning rate for different kind of features will suitable for the real time data set which is having sparse data for example uh during uh the training phase some features might reached near to the converging stage where only it needs a small adjustment that means
