ening, friend, you can basically think that what is coming in your mind to understand the meaning of loops, you must have heard that loop means things that are repeated, okay, it should be done repeatedly, that is, I can say what is repetition, when repetition comes, in coding, R means doing a particular same task again and again. Suppose you have to print Hello World 100 times or 200 times, then you are not going to write it again and again, so what?We should work in such a way that the problem can be solved in a very short time, so we have created loops here, not us, but whoever has created the C language has used loops here. Right, just like we had studied elsewhere, similarly we are going to study loops here today. It is going to be a very special thing, it makes coding easy for you. Okay and it is very important to understand this. In today s lecture, it is used in rape case. Suppose friend, you have to print that you have to print it anytime you want.
