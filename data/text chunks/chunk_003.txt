and schools, some people are working on code blocks, some people are working on some other software.But here we are using VS Code because it is a very good software and in this you can not only do programming in C, after that if you want to do programming in C , Java or any other language, then for that also we will prepare and give you the complete atmosphere in such a way that you do not have to install anything else. So from the beginning, when we work on a good code editor, it has many benefits. The second thing that we will have to install is our compiler for which we will search for GCC.Now compiler is such a system, a software in which rules are written for our programming language. So there will be a C compiler in which all the rules of C language will be written. So whatever code you write, after writing your code, it will check whether you have written the code correctly and the compiler also does the work of running that code.
