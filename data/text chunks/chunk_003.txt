ate a student object. If we have created student class inside it let s create our constructor in it. Inside this we will have a name and self dot name ect name and now what we have to do is we create a student one inside which name isI can pass Shraddha and if I want to delete the student I can simply write deal with and after that if we try to print the student then in that case we will get an error Let s save it and run So in this case we have an error because the name s1 is not defined why because it got deleted here whereas if we were printing the same thing here then no error would come.In that case, normally the thing which is already printed for us would get printed. If we are getting the name printed here and then later if we delete the name and then try to print it, then first it will be printed normally for us but after that because we have deleted that thing, it is showing here that student object has no eligible name. So in this way we can use our dl delete keyword.

a combination of RUGS and LLM where users can ask anything and the model answers them with sources. Then they can also cross check the given answer. Due to this technique, the chances of LLM guessing anything wrong are reduced becauseThe models already have a source that provides the proper context, so they do much less learning. Another big advantage of Ruck is that it is relatively easy. Louis and three other co authors of the original paper explained in a blog that developers can implement this process in just five lines of code, making this method faster and less expensive than fine tuning and allowing users to learn on the go.Sources can be hot swapped. Hot swap means changing models or sources without turning off the system. But how does this rack work? First it takes the data from a database document website or API and then divides them into small chunks and converts them into vector representations or embeddings.
