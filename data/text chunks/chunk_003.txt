a combination of RUGS and LLM where users can ask anything and the model answers them with sources. Then they can also cross check the given answer. Due to this technique, the chances of LLM guessing anything wrong are reduced becauseThe models already have a source that provides the proper context, so they do much less learning. Another big advantage of Ruck is that it is relatively easy. Louis and three other co authors of the original paper explained in a blog that developers can implement this process in just five lines of code, making this method faster and less expensive than fine tuning and allowing users to learn on the go.Sources can be hot swapped. Hot swap means changing models or sources without turning off the system. But how does this rack work? First it takes the data from a database document website or API and then divides them into small chunks and converts them into vector representations or embeddings.
