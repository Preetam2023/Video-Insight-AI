call by values, create a function void swap. There will be two variables inside it, int A and int B. Inside the main function, the value of A is three, the value of B is pa and we write our definition void swap int A, int B. What we have to do is to create a temporary variable t. We will put the value of A inside it. We will put the value of B inside A. We will put the value of A inside B and print it here.Let s make it so that after swapping, a is equal to percentage d and b is equal to percentage d and b. In fact, those who are using variables inside the main function, let s keep it asIf the value is changed then it will be spinged here but we do not want sping here. We need the spring to come inside our main function and get the values done. So here we will see whether the value ofActually there will be swap or not and if the correct answer comes out then it means that you have understood the points well.
