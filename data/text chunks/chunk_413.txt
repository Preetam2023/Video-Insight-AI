oing some work for us, meaning someone is doing calculations. In this we will take two values int A.And int b s parameters, now let s define what we will do do work int a int b we first calculate the sum of both int sum e a b then calculate the product of both int prod e a malla ba b then calculate the average of both to calculate the average we will write a b divide ba 2 so in this way we have written three variables but we cannot return these three so what can we doLet s define these three variables inside our main function and pass the points, like here we will make sum product and average of all three, but these three points will be passed like here, that means three points will be passed here, int star sum int star product and int star average, so here also same values will come int star product product int star, first sum will come then int star product and then int star average. Now hereWe do not need to define because this variable is already created inside the main function.
