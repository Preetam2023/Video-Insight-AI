it had to be done but if it was not true then it got the next condition which is not adult printed. Now if we had put a terminator right here, then the first error would have occurred because of the terminator.After that, we cannot apply semicalculus, that is why it would not be right to put terminator here. Also, turn operator has to be used only when we have a single line. Because we cannot put terminator here, whenever we have to write a single statement in if else, we can use ternary operator instead of it. This is very important. The syntax is very good. This operator does not have much practical usage. Mostly in your placements orIf this is asked in the exams, then we can keep it in mind.
