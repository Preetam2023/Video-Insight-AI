en you divide an integer by 10, an integer is an int data type, in a computer, the last digit is removed, meaning the second hint for our friend here would be that if I divide 19325 by 10, I know the answer, what we get is 193 2. You will not get just that much because it is an integer. If we are talking about computers, then I hope you must have thought a little bit about it. Now I will code it for you, first of all.Let me explain the algorithm that what we will do is going to be very simple, suppose we have taken the input n, this is 19325. Okay, so what we will do is that we will put it in a loop, we will keep dividing it by 10, meaning first of all, I will take another variable called int count in which I will count the digits of that number, like its answer is F and I will initialize it with what is zero, meaning for once in this, we will count.
