g here, then getus will input our string and what put s will do is put s will output our string i.e. simply we have to write put s SR, this will output our string and if before this we do get s atr, this will input our string but here the get s function is not a dangerous function andIt has an outdated function, due to which many softwares get hacked because Get S does not track what is the maximum size of the ATR, hence, Gets are not used nowadays.
