can write this variable like this. We can also create a variable by adding or adding the last digit.As soon as we add, like what we did inside the sum, let s say our n is 1 2 3 4 5. Okay, so we added the fw and as soon as we did, then again we will do one thing here, will bring n back to n ba 10. Okay, pay attention to this thing and we will put a loop on this whole thing. Now let s see what is right in it, how much is wrong, we will put a loop in this whole thing and the condition is going to remain the same until our number is not.Will remain equal to zero, once here I show algorithm wise what is happening with us, let s see this on another page, let s say my number is 1 2 3 45, so what will I do, first of all, I am denoting this variable by my last digit, LD, the last digit is always mine, what will happen to the number if I take the modus by 10, that is, five is okay last.I got my digit and then I started talking to myself.
