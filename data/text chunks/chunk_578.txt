een that yes, it is okay, we store different types of data, but actually there are some limitations. If a question comes in your paper or interview, ask what are the benefits of structures, like the benefit of array. We had understood that what was the benefit of array, that to store the same type of data, first of all, you do not have to create different variables. Suppose you have to store 100 integers, then you have to create 100 different variables.There is no need to remember, we have to create a single array and we have to remember each variable integer, we will access all the rest from it and all the activities like even sorting are done on it, like sorting in increasing order, sorting in decreasing order and when we do different complexity algorithms, they are solved by using many arrays, then there we get the benefit of arrays, similarly we use structures.
