to print it like this, you will do it yourself and this is going to be solved exactly like what we did with the factorial, we are inside the loop itself, like here I have written print F here, right?You can write the rest of the hints here, I will not tell you the rest, you will solve it yourself. Let s go ahead friend and solve this question. After that, we have one or two and some two or four questions left. This lecture will be over and the next lecture is going to be very explosive which will solve the question on pattern printing. What is there, two numbers are entered through the keyboard. Okay, assume A and B, both the numbers are fine.Is write a program to find the value of one number ray to the power of another means if I take input of two numbers a and b then I have to print and show the power of a is b. Suppose both the numbers are my value of a is 0 and value of b is my 5 then I have to print the answer 2 ray to the power of 5 i.e.
