ut as soon as I enter 14, thank you will be printed. Why the code ends here because 14 is our sen s.The multiple is 7 Ba 2 is 14, so here this model is equal to row, so from here we have done break. Break means no more lines of the loop have gone and whatever is written outside the loop will now start executing. Now one more special thing about break, break is ours, it also makes us exit from the nested loop, that is, you have written some things inside one for loop and inside that you have written your second for loop.Loop, some things are written inside it, so if break is written here, then it will take us out of this loop and also out of this loop and the statements here will be our run, so whenever we have to use break, we have to use it very thoughtfully as to how the control flow of your program is going to change. Next we will read about the continue statement. It is the opposite of break. Continue break says here stop all the work and move ahead. Continue says that s it.
