e not studied all these things, okay, so again here my friend, the basic which we learned in coding.That thing can be useful, how can you write it like this, you can declare a variable, friend int a again started with one, then you will put the for loop, do the for loop only with i, keep its variable separate and I am saying n terms, then write this, okay it will run till n plus plus normally it means just n times the loop is running, this statement means whatever thing is inside will run n times but we will run the thing inside.How do we modify it, first of all, we print it, we have to print it, we have to print a, percentage d, I write it here, I don t say aa, sorry, we have to print a, just what do we have to change in a, like I did in the previous a, a a 3, which is our common difference here.
