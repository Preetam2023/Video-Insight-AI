e data that needs to be written will be written, then the data of your entire file gets overwritten. If you open it with write or write binary, but you want the old data to also be saved and my new data below it gets stored, then in that case we use append i.e. use A as a mode.Append means adding locks to the old one, then your new data will start getting added after the old data. So, these are the five most important modes which we can use. Whenever we open a file, now first of all let us look at a best practice. Our best practice is that if we are opening a file for reading, then before reading the data from it, first of all we should check whether our file also exists, then the file exists.We write the code to check whether it does or not. Suppose we are trying to open a file whose name is New Test. Now if New Test does not exist, then we just discussed that if F is in read mode inside PTR, then what would have come inside F PTR.
