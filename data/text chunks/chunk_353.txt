od a complex FINA very well. Now remember this because a lot of FINA questions are asked before you. We have already solved the next question which was how to write a function to print the eighth term of the FINA sequence. We have asked that question now.End terms have to be done in the same way as we have done with recurs, we can do the same thing with loop also, so it will be easier to do it with loop but I would like to give it as a homework problem because I want you to try this question yourself that how can we do this question with loop, how can we write this series, so we have asked a lot of questions, we have read a lot of concepts, here I would request a little light.
