n front of it. If we have to output its value then we will normally write the name of that variable. Now you will notice that we have written the name of the array, after that we have put these on the square brackets inside.A number is written in the input as well as in the output. This means that whenever we are talking about memory, suppose we have created an array named Marx which has three memory locations inside it, then we must have stored some value inside it. Now whenever we write row Marx square bracket 0, it means that we want to know this number or want to input it. If we write Marx of one, it means that we want to know this number eitherIf we are talking about or want to input, and we write marks of two, it means that we want to know this number or are inputting it. So whatever number you write inside that line tells us about which position of the number in the array.
