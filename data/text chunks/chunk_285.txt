er is b, it will take both the parameters and will create an even value from them which will be a b.And it will return it, now it is returning so what is the type of this value int, that is why we have written int in front of the name of our function, let us create a function which will take the value of two numbers i.e. two numbers, its parameters will be a and b and it will return us the sum of both the values, so for this, first of all, let s remove our old code, enter first number int a and b, then first of all we will scan a, after that we will enter our second number, what is in the second number?We will store the value of the second number in B. Now let s create a function which will give us the sum of both A and B. So first of all, this time we will be writing E sum int a int b. This time we did not write void here, this time we wrote int here like int is written in front of main because it returns zero.
