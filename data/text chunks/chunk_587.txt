make s1 roll number, then make s1 CGPA, but now we are able to do all these things in a single line.I am going in the format in which I have defined the parameters inside the structure and I suggest that whenever you declare things, you should always go in the same order so that if a new person comes and is reading your code or any other programmer then this is a very good programming habit that assign values to them in the order in which you declare things so that it looks systematic. Yes, if the roll number is written first then it will be his roll number.After that, if we want to write CGPA, then we write our CGPA and after that we write the name and save it. Now we will be able to access the values like before, like if I want to print F, student s roll number from percentage D, then here we can write s1 dot roll number, save it and run it.
