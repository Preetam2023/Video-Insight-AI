.Which is one? How is this value assigned? The value of a is assigned to c, then the value of c i.e. and is assigned to b, then the value of b i.e. and is assigned to a. So the process is like this. We can try it once in our code like if we declare some variables x y and z then we can give values x y z 4. So the statement like this is valid inside c butSame if we see the second version of this in which we give four here at the time of declaration itself i.e. make all these equal to two and we think that we skip one line, why write us extra, here the red line comes automatically. Why did this red line come because when we are assigning four to z, then its value is going to y and he is thinking that till now what is z, the compiler does not know what it is because this line is not finished yet.Inside the same line, we are also assigning a value to z and giving its value to someone else.
