do we have to change in a, like I did in the previous a, a a 3, which is our common difference here. Simply write a a 2 meaning whatever the number is, what will be the new number, the old number, like earlier I had one, so 1 2 became 2, now a, then what will be the next a, 2 2 4, then the next a will be 4 2 8, by doing like this, you can also do this thing, let s see its results once, then we will see the results, then quite magical results will come and we will check the code by copying and pasting it, there is no need to write it again and again, we will write it here.GP D C is okay and let s do one thing here, no friend, let s do one thing, no friend, let s print this work, no friend, okay, let s write here this and what we have to print, let s take a look, we have to print this GP T 4 8 16 32 and so no okay, you have to print all this thing, it s very good, so simple again aa, you have started it from one, what do you write till here that it is going to a only.
