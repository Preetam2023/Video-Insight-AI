w we have written a big function in which we went to the boxes one by one and calculated the length. This is an already made function. We do not need to create it again. So String Dot Length is a function in which we write our string and it counts and gives us the total number of characters. Now it counts the number of characters.characters but excludes the null character, just like we haven t counted the null character yet This also does not count the null character, so this is an important thing that we have to remember that our string length does not count the null character, it returns the total number of characters and gives us the total number of characters. We count our length once and check it. This time we define the name here itself. In the name, we put Shraddha and this time we will call ATR in place of count length. We include the string length above in our header file include the string D.Let s save it. Here we have called string length in which we have passed our name.
