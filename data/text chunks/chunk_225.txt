d here also 2 1 1, but we have to assume that our first term is one and the second term is also one. We have to take this thing with us, it is fine, so how to calculate it, friend, but how do we calculate the last term of our final term?Look, think here, I want you to think a little, of course, we are going to use loops because there is going to be repetition, again and again we see that the value of one is going to be formed by combining two, okay, here we will use loops only, but friend, here I would like to give you a hint, hint number one of mine is going to be that we have to play with two and three variables, okay, I write three variables to make it easier.For this, we will have to play with three variables. What means that last time when I was calculating the factorial of a number, I was keeping the factorial of one number. When I was keeping the sum of series, I had to keep an extra variable along with the I variable which is available in the loop.
