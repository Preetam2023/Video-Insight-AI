our greater than is equal to 1 i minus and every time we will print f, the percentage d n of our i. Now the first thing to note is that our i wasWe have also declared here If int i 1 and here also declared int i 1 then will there be an error, the compiler will say that you have declared the same variable twice, we had learned that this is wrong, then here the error will not come because whatever variable we declare here inside the for loop, its value remains only till that for loop, that is, as you must have seen, in the beginning, instead of even, I tried to print i here.But the value of my i is only inside this block. I cannot use my aa outside this block, so outside this block the compiler does not know what aa is, that is why i cannot be used here, here only even can be used, that is why the life time of i ended here, so here the compiler does not know what aa is, so we can declare a new variable aa again, which we did.The value of i is initialized with n i.e.
