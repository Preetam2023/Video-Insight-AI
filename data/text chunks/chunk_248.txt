should the loop start? Let it start from our number itself. Int should start from i 1 and go till n. From one to n, f will take it or from n to one or from one.If we have n then we will do i plus plus every time and we will take another variable. We will initialize the factorial factorial variable with one. When we did sum from one to the end, we initialize it with row. Why did we initialize it with one, it will become row, that is why whenever we have to take sum, if we want to initialize it with row, then we will multiply our number aa every time. This code is equal to the even code.It might seem similar to what we used to do in sum, sum i, here what we are doing is factorial factorial multiply by i and in this way the value of the final factorial will be the factorial of our number, so let us try this also.
