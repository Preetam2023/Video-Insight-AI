I have taken a new variable named power. Okay, I have taken a new variable named power and one turn.Put the value one in it now again and again power is equal to two Now the value of power is 1 into a The value of a is 2 So inside the power put two so put here t Then our i becomes plus plus so aa goes ahead i is going to run five times our Here you can also write a but anyway, next time the loop runs then power is equal to two, the value of power is two, this time and the value of two is also two, so four has been put in power, you understand that it will happen like this, then again power is equal to two, the value of power is four but the value of a is still two, so 4 2 8. Okay, then similarly here power is equal to power 2.So 8 2 16 and finally for the fifth time power e is 16 2 i.e. 32 and at last we got it printed. Simple anytime friend, if you are getting one less print like suppose you have mistakenly labeled i, then what to do then you will see what is the problem in the code.
