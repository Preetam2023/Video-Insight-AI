he same input and output whether we use points or we use these things normally i.e. square brackets.The output input will remain the same in both, we can just use whichever is more convenient for us, but one thing that we always have to remember is that the first index of the array is a pointer in itself, that thing should never be forgotten. The next thing that we will talk about is array as function argument. Now just like we can pass normal integer array, float, character as argument in the function, similarly we can also pass the array inside the function calls, i.e.We can create a function that prints the value of an array, then you put any array inside it, it will print its value, then in its argument you will have to define an array in its parameter. What is the format? First comes the function declaration.
