so we use it to free memory that is allocated using malloc and calc and it has a very simple format. It has a very simple syntax to write it, we will just write free and put inside the pointer, this is that pointer.Which is pointing to the memory which we have to free, then let s write a small program for this too. We have just allocated n integers from Calc and at the end of the program, we will free this memory, then we will free the memory which PTR was pointing to and again what will we do with PTR, we will point it towards some other memory, like if we want to write the same statement again, now instead of integer n, there will be memory of only two integers.And we will get that also printed. What we did inside this code is that first we took a memory of n size, the pointer is pointing to that size, we printed whatever values were there and then freed that memory.
