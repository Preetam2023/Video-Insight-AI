type, that is, it can store more values.So what the C compiler does is apply a little bit of logic. How to apply the logic is that if int value is small but float value is big and any operation is done in between them, say plus or multiply or divide, a big number will come in the output. Now to store that big number, a big container is needed i.e. a container like float is needed, that is why we do not keep int in out, we keep float. So whenever the operation of int will be performed, we will have it with float.Float will come in the output. What can be its examples? Example like if we multiply int with two then the answer will come as four. But here multiply 2.0. If with two then we will get 4.0 in the output. And here if we multiply 2.0 with 2.0 then the output will be 4.0. If we write this in our code then first of all we will get F printed as 2 .2, if we save it, the output will be 4, but if 2.0 is multiplied with two, then here this error comes.
