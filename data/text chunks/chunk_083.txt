n times, whatever is our thing inside, here we will run n times, but you just create a new variable.Introduce a by name int a equal to two whatever your number is 100 float a sorry float because later on go invent I hope you will be understanding all these things and also take a above you have to take a from the user input and here you have to write a let s go ahead friend now see whatever you put inside the loop it all gets repeated what I mean to say by this is that I have already told you that it is not necessary that there should be a statement inside the loop.There will be many statements inside so all the things will be repeated like if I write for anything and here if I write line our line one then here I write line number two statement three line three as many as we want then all these will be repeated as many times as we will put the loop.
