ve named this bucket, we have named it B. What we have to do is that in A we need 5 liters of water. In B, we need 3 liters of water, so how will we bring a third bucket. This third bucket has arrived and the third bucket is empty. There is nothing inside it, so either we first pour the water of B in it, then B will become empty, after that, pour the water of A in B. Now if we do this, then our water will come inside B.3 liters of water, this bucket was empty, there is 5 liters of water of B inside it and we had emptied A into B, so now A is empty, now what will we do if we pour the water of this bucket back inside A, then finally 5 liters will come inside A, 3 liters will come inside B and this bucket will be completely empty, so in this way, whenever we have to interchange the water of two buckets, we bring a third empty bucket and Similarly here, if we have to interchange the values of two variables, then we will bring a third empty variable.
