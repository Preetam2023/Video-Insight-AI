one then the value of the last digit becomes mine one then back to sum is equal to current sum i.e. 14 plus last digit is my one then it becomes 15 then the value of the sum becomes my 15 and my n n module n then n becomes my zero as soon as n becomes zero I have to end the loop so again my code is going to be similar to this, let s do it quickly and we will do this in ourLet s copy the code because almost our code is going to remain like this. Okay, let s go inside the loops. What was its name? A sum of digits. Sum of digits dot C. Okay and let s copy paste it here for once. Look, I took a number as input. I said enter a number. Same scanf is the normal thing. Instead of count, I write sum here. Okay, sum is our zero. Same while i y is the same, I mean the same while n is not.
