n on a single variable on the left hand side, all of them go to our right hand side i.e. a b c ba d. We will have an expression like this, we will assign all its values to some variable on the left which will be written on the left hand side and all these values will be stored from right to left.And in the left side, we always have to keep in mind that we have a single variable. All the output will be stored inside the single variable. If we keep in the left side that we want to store two variables int x y a b, then what will happen in this case is that the value of a b will be assigned to y but will not be assigned toIn which the value of a b is stored, then on the left it means that for this expression, we have only y in which its value is stored. After this, we will talk about what are our expressions valid in Arithmetic instructions, what are not some basic operations.
