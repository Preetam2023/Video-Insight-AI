r looking at this sequence a little carefully, it becomes clear that each number has its own number.This number is the sum of the last two numbers, like the first number is always zero, the second number is always one, the third number is the sum of row and two i.e. 0 1 1, the fourth number is the sum of one and one, this three is the sum of one and 2. This is five is the sum of two and three, this is 8 and the sum of five is 13, the sum of 5 and a is 21, the sum of 8 and 13 and the whole sequence continues in this manner, so here every number is the sum of its previous two numbers, so in a way we can say that fina, if we have to find out, assume any number, we have to find fina of two, this is fina of zero, this is fina of one.
