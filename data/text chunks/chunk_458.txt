e same output in both the notations. The next topic which we will discuss is Multi Dimension Arrays. That is, the arrays we have studied till now are wide arrays. They work in one dimension. What is dimension? Linear. In this way, we had our array but suppose we have to keep two arrays, then keep them one after the other.After that, if you want to keep three arrays, you can keep one array one after the other, so here we play with dimensions, that is, we need three arrays and the size of each array is 10, so I create a 2D array. In this way, we define the 2D array, first of all we will write its type int, after that we will write Then we will write its name as array, two square brackets, the number of square brackets inside the multi dimension array will tell how many dimensions it has, now till now we were writing int a a a of 3, so it meant that it has one dimension. Two square brackets means it has two dimensions and how will we define it on the right side.
