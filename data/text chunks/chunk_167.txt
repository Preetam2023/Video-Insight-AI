for Friday we will keep F, for Saturday we will keep small S and for Sunday we will take capital S. So in this way we will take our day.And here now we change the case, we will write the characters in the case, we save it and now we run it again, so here we have to write S, if we de our enter. So this time we are going to enter F, then Friday is printed for us and this time we have entered any other character like suppose we have entered t the rate, in that case what is printed is not a valid day, so we can use the characters as a constant and we can also use our integers as a constant. Now after this, the switch has some properties of its own, like mainly about two properties, we will talk first of all about the cases can.As we wrote B in any order, not A, first of all we wrote that for one, Monday is to be printed, for two, Tuesday is to be printed, so we could have made them up and down also.
