re. Then look here add one more count and add three. Then see is one zero?Otherwise divide it by 10. See the meaning of n n 10 and see the original. You n 1 2 3 4 whatever was 10 is fine, you all should know this. A. Okay, as n n 10 means, similarly we divide by doing n n 10. Okay, here we were n n by 10, so 1 by 10, our zero comes, pay attention in integer and this will become my 4. Now the value of n is zero, so is zero not equal to zero, otherwise we had to run the loop until there was zero, it became zero, our loop is finished, so see.The value of the count is done, we just printed it, it is very simple, I hope you have understood the question because the next question I am going to ask is absolutely based on this, it is absolutely based on this, just a little difference will come here, pay attention to that question, let s move ahead, the question is write a program to print the sum of digits of a given number.
