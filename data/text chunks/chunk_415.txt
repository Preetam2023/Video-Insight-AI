entage d and here first of all sum then product then average. I hope this thing will be clear to us.That inside this function, we have passed by reference, we have passed by reference of these three variables, we have passed by value of these two variables, we do not want any changes in the values of a and b, inside the main, they normally passed by value but we wanted the values inside these three, so we passed them by reference and calculated their values, calculated and passed the values inside the main function.If we store it and get it run, then the sum of our three and five has come, the product of both has come to 15 and the average of both has come to four, that is, 5 3 8 and divided by 2 is 4. So in this way, when we need multiple values in the return, inside the second function, then what to do is pass by reference. You will pass by reference, you will send that empty value of that variable, store the value inside it and take it back.In this way, points are very useful.
