here we will get an error. Let s verify it by coding it once. Let s make an array of only five size.Inside this, first of all, we will print the percentage DB n, our AA 2 and then AR 5, three is printed in arr2, because there is three at this position, but row is printed at five, that means there is no valid value there, it is not a part of our array, hence row has deleted whatever value was lying there, now we will do next Practice Question 44 Practice Question 44 tells us right.Function to Reverse an Array We have been given an array. Suppose we have been given an array of size four. The values inside it are 1 2 3 4. We have given the value of this array. The values have to be reversed i.e. a final output array should come to us, there should be 4 3 2 and one inside it, so this is a very important question. There are many ways to do this question and we will discuss one of them classical way.
