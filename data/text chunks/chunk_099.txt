t is the problem this isThe loop is this, the loop inside this loop of mine has gone from two to 24. Okay, if you understand, then understand that my loop has run 23 times. The loop has run 23 times. Okay, but how many times was it supposed to run only 3 4 5. Why four times? Because look, when the value of my aa became two, then three, then four, e f, but I came to know that it is composite, so mine should be eliminated, right, that is the same loop.Why should I go further, listen to one thing, as there are many factors in a composite number, now as soon as I have understood, like six is a composite number, one is fine, there are factors of six, one two, 6 is fine, or if we take factors of 12, if there are too many, then it will be more correct, the factors of 12 are my one, two, three, four, six, then our 12 is fine, so when the loop will run in 12, as soon as you divide by two, you will know.
