ange it, put a bracket, save it, the output will be 15 and the last question inside this is 5 2 2 3. What will be there in this, we have three operations in this, first of all there is addition, then there is divide, then there is multiply. Now whose higher president is higher president, whose higher president is the same president of divide and multiply, then we will put left associativity left.From associativity, what will it convert into? 5 P, first we will do 2 2, then we will multiply it by 3, then we will add it to five, this will become 5 P, the inner expression becomes 1 3, after that we will do 5 3 and this will become 8. Now let s do the same in the same output. We had the expression 5 2 divided by 2 divided by 3, save it andIf we run the AT in the output, then the questions of this type will be asked in your MCQs also, at the placement time or you will be asked in the college test of your school, then how to answer the question.
