on we will send a variable int n. Now it is not necessary that we name it n here, we will call it x.You can name any number, that is, in which variable do you store that value inside the main function and what name do you want to give to the same value inside the second function, they can be the same or can be different, if you keep the same then it will be easy to keep track of which value is going where, if there are names of the beans, then we will know that if we want to get even, then only a and b have to come out, x and y do not come out in this way, but weNow whenever we declare a variable inside a function, the scope of the name of that variable is only till that function, that is, if we create a variable n in the main function, then the only function that will recognize this n will be the main one.
