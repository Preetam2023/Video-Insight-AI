ill be raised then your program will crash. Now let s ask some questions about functions and recurs. The first question which we are going to do is write a function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. We saw that.Used to study Physics in 11th and 12th, so what was the first basic thing in it? The first basic thing was taught in Thermodynamics or I don t know in which chapter. Convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit. If you convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius then there is no need to memorize its formula. It is not important which formula will be used. You can also ask the teacher for the formula. You might have usually given it in exams or coding.If this question has been given in the test, then the formula would have been given in it. The formula is that multiply 9 5 by whatever value of Celsius and add 32 to it, like 0, if we take 0 Celsius, what is the multiply by 0.18 32, then 0 degree Celsius is our 32 degree burst, so this method of calculation remains with us.
