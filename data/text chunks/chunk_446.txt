difference comes in the data type, how many data types are there, we will talk about the next topic. The next topic says that we read in the pointer array, why we read it because the array is a pointer, the array we were reading is actually a pointer, how if we create a pointer int star pointer and make it point to the first location of the array i.e. the address of the array of zero, if we read the array of this pointer.If we store it inside, we would be doing something like this. We have already learned the syntax, but if we want to replace this whole part on the right side with an array, we can also do this, that is, the location on the first index of our array, the name of the array, is actually a pointer, where does the array need an index, like if I have an array, suppose there is an array named Marks which has a lot of numbers.
