ce does not exist. This is our base case i.e. the condition which we should know in advance in fina.We know that the zero term is zero, the first term is one, we already know this, we have calculated it, now what will we do inside the main function, we will get it printed, here we call our fina off, suppose we want to print six terms, we save it and run it, so we have a lot of terms printed instead of six terms of fina, this is why this happened, the reason for this, we understand a little from the diagram why this happened.So many terms were printed because when we try to calculate, say, Fina of five, it calculates first Fina of four and then Fina. What does off three and fina of four do? First calculates fina of three, then fina of two. Finna of three first calculates fina of two and then fina of one. So here this two and this two have been calculated twice, so they have been printed twice. If we talk about three also, then three will be printed once here.
