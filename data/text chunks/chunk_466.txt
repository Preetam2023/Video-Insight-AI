ble in which we will store the count. In the beginning, our count is zero, after that we run a loop. This loop will go from i 0 to i n. This loop will traverse the entire array. Traverse means it will travel and see. Through the loop, we will go inside the elements of the array one by one. We will check for each element. If array of i, we have got the value of that element from array of i, how will we check it? Module 2 is not.Equal T What came from here? First of all, we took out the element from the array of i and looked at it. Is it being multiplied completely? If it is not multiplying then it means reminder. If zero does not come then it means it is an odd number. So as soon as we get the odd number, we will count it. Plus plus count was zero in the beginning, that is, in the beginning we did not have a single odd number. We will check for each element whether it is odd, whether it is odd, whether it is odd.As soon as there is an odd, increase the count by one i.e.
