then we have to return zero and if the value of our n is one then in that case we have to return no. Now this is our complete code, the recursive code to calculate FINA, this will be our base condition. What do we do in the base case? We write both of them like different conditions instead of off.Writing one condition if n becomes zero, anywhere n becomes zero i.e. fina of zero we have to return then it is row only. If anywhere we have to return for n 1 then fubo of one is always one. Now here for fina of one we will not calculate fubo of 1 and fina of 1 because for 1 the sequence does not exist. This is our base case i.e. the condition which we should know in advance in fina.
