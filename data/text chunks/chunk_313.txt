e pass a parameter which will tell how many times we print it. We can also call it count. Int count. Let s write the definition of this function void print hello world and here the count will be coming that how many times we have to print it but there is no loop inside it.What will it do inside the function, it will print the word Hello only once? What is this function, it is a little lazy, it will do a little work itself and will get the rest done by itself in the next call, so what will it do now, it will print Hello World, it will not print the count times on Hello World, it will not print the count times, it will call itself to print the count times, then print Hello World, now it has printed it once, Hello World has been printed, now the count times had to be printed n times here.It can happen five times here, it can happen even 10 times.
