nstead of CGPA, percentage can be stored somewhere. Name of parents can be stored for every student. Their Aadhar ID can be stored for every student, which means all the information will be common, so instead of creating same type of variables again and again, it is better to do good management. Data management is also a very important core concept. When we do programming, then how to manage the data in a good way. If there is same type of information thenFor that, create the same data type which we create with the help of structure, hence all the data comes to us in structured format. Next if we talk about it, we will read next about array of structures. Now we had read that we can create an array of integers, like if we want to store the roll numbers of students, then for 100 students, we have created an array of students roll numbers.
