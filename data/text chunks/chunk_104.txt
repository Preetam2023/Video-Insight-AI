go to work and if Sunday comes then we do not go to work then we have to sit at home and take rest. How can we show this entire flow in the code with the help of variables and with the help of cases that on which day we have to go to work and on which day we have to stay at home? So whenever we are writing those instructions, we call them cases.Let s put these three under control. We will read about sequence control in the upcoming chapters. We have already read it. The next topic which we will talk about in this chapter is our operators. Now we have already seen the basic of operators. What were operators. We have come to the category of operators in Arith. Plus, minus, multiply, divide, multiply, divide and module, so these are the five majors in Arith.We have already read about the operators. Now there are more different types of operators in C. We have relational operators which tell the relation between two operands.
