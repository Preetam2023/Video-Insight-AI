t is also divisible by six, then it is also divisible by eight and it is also divisible by 12, okay.Are you understanding what I am trying to say, maybe anyone who knows a little bit of maths would be understanding, but as soon as I put the brakes, of course I write 24, it will be written only once, The given number is composite. So, we have successfully written our code for how to find out if a given number is composite and not. This code is not for find out if a given number is prime and not.But we have to find out whether the number is prime or not. Okay, we have seen that when a number is composite, using the break statement, clearly this is a good code. So much so that our code is clear that the number is our composite or not. Now you will say, okay, if I run and write 23 or 47 is a prime number, then look, nothing is being written, then you can say one thing definitely from here, nothing is being written because 47.
