n as Fina Spiral. If you go to learn any programming language, you will get the Fina sequence there. What is the sequence of natural numbers?Natu 3 4 5 6 What is the sequence of whole numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 What is the sequence of our odd numbers 1 3 5 7 Even numbers 2 4 6 8 10 Similarly, there is a sequence in nature which is called Fina sequence, this sequence looks something like this 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 Now whenSeeing this for the first time, it seems that random numbers are written, that is, they have written whatever number they want on the screen, but it is not actually so. It was made by Indian mathematicians and the sequence was made with a lot of thought. In the sequence, first comes row, then comes one, then comes one, then two, then 3 5 8 13 21 and so on. After looking at this sequence a little carefully, it becomes clear that each number has its own number.
