ve to give Y, we have also given the second term, now I give that the sum will be Aps B, that is, the value of the sum will become my T for one time. Let s write down here, what is the value of A, what is B going to be, what is B going to be, okay?Let s go inside the loop. Let me show you what you have to do inside the loop. I have removed the same value from back. Now see what I am going to do inside the loop. Look very carefully. It is okay to think about this thing. I have made a number a 1 b 1. Okay, here I have declared two numbers. That s my first and second term for now, then I made another variable sum, okay, now I have not given some S s inside the sum, now what I do in the loop, inside the loop, I invert the sum all the time from a p b to sum equal a p b, here I just wrote sum, I write even or sum e 0, first okay, then give a number, I wrote even equal a p b, then I go back to something here.
