very time we are doing plus plus to i then we will make j minus minus and get it printed every time. Now we can remove our j inside this for loop complete. Now let s listen carefully what happened inside it. Already we had a variable i whose value was starting from one. This time we inserted a new variable and named it j. The value of j we started n.The job of this aa will be to calculate the sum. The job of this j will be to print the numbers in reverse order. The condition of i is that i will print the numbers in reverse order till there is no less than n. The condition of j is that till there is no greater number n, things will be printed in the reverse order. So we know that till the time i goes from one to n, j will go from n to one. So, we have put an end here between both the conditions.That is, both of ours should be true.
