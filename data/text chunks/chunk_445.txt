er pointer. In the comparison, obviously both will not return true. But analyze the difference once.If we do this then here we will see that the error came in the beginning itself because we cannot take the difference of an integer pointer from a character pointer. These two are not compatible types, so whenever the difference has to be taken, that is, one pointer will be minus the other pointer, then they should be points of the same type and not of different types, then this thing has to be kept in mind that whenever the difference of points is taken and the difference number does not come, it means the difference of the numbers in both.The difference comes in the data type, how many data types are there, we will talk about the next topic.
