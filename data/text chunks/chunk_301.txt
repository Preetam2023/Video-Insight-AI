clear if we have understood the functions very well, we have seen the questions questions properly. Try to do the same a little bit yourself by pausing the video from time to time, so far we should not have any issue in the code, there should not be any problem, it should be understood very easily because the most basic things have been done, we have declared our function, we have defined the function and called the function. Now let us do a different thing, here we get the value printed, first we called the function, now we print the value.If we get it done then the value is percentage f value. Now let s save it. What should happen according to our logic? First of all we have written the value as 100. Then the calculate price was called. What did the calculate price do? It changed the value to 100. On 18th GST, the price became 118. So it got the value printed here. 118 will now come back inside the main function. Now again the value will be added.
