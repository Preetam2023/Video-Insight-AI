ars. Star is save it. Now let us compile this statement. Once compiled, we have a warning generated. What the warning says is that we have made it a multi character constant, meaning we have put multiple characters here.This is an error thing, we cannot do this, if we put space inside the character then it will also not compile, the same thing will ask why you have put space, that is why whenever we create characters, we have to put a single value inside them, only then they will compile successfully. If we are writing one here, then whatever is one, it will compile, but if two is written along with one, then there are two characters here, in a way, thisIt will not compile ours, it will give us the warning of implicit conversion. Why are these warnings given because if we put multiple characters or even if we put star star then it takes up so much space inside the memory which is bigger than the space given to the character.
