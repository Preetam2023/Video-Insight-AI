I want to explain the do while loop to you in some clarity by doing questions. Let s talk about this lure. We will see about it. This is essentially what is called useless, so it is useless. I am teaching this only to you because sometimes it is possible that the same code may accidentally appear in the placement test in your semester exam. By using do while, you should not know the thing about ternary operator.
