be exactly the same as if we use arrays.Let s do what happens in arrays, we have fixed size memory. What we are doing here is that we are taking dynamic size memory, so we can use them also like arrays, just the size is not fixed here, it is such a simple thing like I store one at the required location, in first array I store three, then in PTR of two I store five, in PT of 3 I store seven and in PTR ofIf I store it in 4, then in this way I have stored some value in all the five integer locations and now I can run a loop. I can print all these values by applying a loop from i 0 to i 5i. P PTR of Aa is like we access the locations of the array and after that we store the values in it, then access those values and get them printed. The same process will remain whenever we will allocate memory from malloc and use a pointer. Let us run it once and see that then we have all the integers that I had stored in my memory. They have returned to me and if any operation has to be done with them.
