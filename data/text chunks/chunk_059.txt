nal. If we enter radius in the terminal, then we get the output that the area of the circle is 28.2.600 So in this way we can solve these questions, whatever we have read in this chapter till now, now our chapter one is over, here we have completed all the basic concepts of our chapter one i.e. C very successfully. By using all these concepts, there are such questions which are sometimes asked in your mid semester or end semester exam like this can happenConversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius can be given. Conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit can be given or we have formulas to calculate simple interest. We can tell you to apply this formula or here like we have calculated the radius, from the radius we have calculated the area, from the radius we have calculated the area, in the same way we can call it the area of a rectangle, we can call it the area of a triangle or it can be called compound interest. If you want to calculate, then basically you will learn the basics of math.
