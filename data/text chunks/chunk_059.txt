py and paste it and see if we can create a difference. Control C, let s make it a little lower here. Let s go inside A without maths and control B. So what should we change in the same to the same code in which we have a little problem with this formula. Our maths is not strong enough to apply this formula and later the GP is going to come, so it can be a bigger problem but we definitely know this. Look at this.Where is the number of things starting from and is it going to be ours? Okay, let s talk about that or how can we solve this? Tell me one thing, if I have written A here, it means 100 , this is how many times the loop will run, this many times the loop will run, okay, look at our loop 3n, pay attention here, 3n pv times, our loop is not running if we are printing this A. 4 7 10 13 Okay, if we are printing this A here.
