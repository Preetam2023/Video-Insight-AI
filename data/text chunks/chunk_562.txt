seach which we want to send is E in the beginning and we will call check character F R E here on C. Now if we save it and run it then it is written character is present but here if we had replaced e withWhat remains is the logic? We will traverse the string one by one. We will keep removing the characters and keep checking our conditions. So I hope that we got to learn a lot about the string. There are some additional questions inside the class that we can solve. The next chapter we will talk about is going to be our Structures which is a really important chapter whenever we talk about C programming because structures are there right.Let s form the basis. After reading the structures of c p, we will start understanding some of the things that exist inside c p. So now we are going to start our chapter nine, whose name is Structures. Now before this we have seen many collection data types like we have seen a collection of integers, an integer array, a collection of characters, a string.
