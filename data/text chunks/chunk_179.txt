, friend, whatever number we have, we have to pick the last digit, then what will we do with it, friend, we will multiply it by 10, so here I will write the hint to multiply by 10, I hope you will be understanding some things friend, how to do it, now once I write the algorithm in front of you, then you try to solve it again, it is okay, I would put the hints below.Okay, after making some space, now I try to write the algorithm. Algorithm means how can this thing be done, okay of course, I will put all the things in a loop, so accept whatever is my while loop, okay, the while loop has come, my condition is the same that my n should be greater than zero, till then my loop will continue but I will talk about thinking inside the loop, so how to do it, so let s do it in a slightly different way, okay we can do one thing.
