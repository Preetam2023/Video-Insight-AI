is one based indexing, but C P, Java are such languages in which zero based indexing is zero based.That is, we will not call the first position one, if we say zero, then we have to always keep this thing in mind. Now let s talk about how the array has to take input or output. So to take the input, first of all we have to write Percentage D, whatever type we are going to take the value input and we treat this mark of square brackets like a variable, that is, like the values of a normal variable, we write edge or marks one marks two, in the same way we write the value of the array.When we talk about a variable, we can write it Marks 0 Marks One Marks Two These will also be treated like a normal variable and inside this normal variable, if we have to take any value input then we will put address of operator in front of it. If we have to output its value then we will normally write the name of that variable.
