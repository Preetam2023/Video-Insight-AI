ll append null character in our string. The next question which we will talk about is a special one. This question has been created by myself. There is a concept called salting. Whenever we do hacking, neither our password nor our password is secure.In companies, how are passwords secured? The technique by which they are secured is first saltis. Suppose you have set a password. The password is yours. Test 1 2 3 This is your password and the company has a string. The string is the ABC of the company. So saltis is that the company will take your password and add its own salt inside it. Just like we sprinkle salt inside a vegetable, similarly whenever a company saves the password, there is no salt inside it.
