sense to us. We call that type of file a binary file. Now the binary file also has different types. There can be formats like if we talk about extensions then our binary file is d mp3mp 4jp which contains our photos etc. all these are extensions of our binary files and if we talk about non binary files then d txx.com is also a TT file. If we talk about dot java then it is also a TT file because we will understand the data written in it and if we edit it then those changes will be visible to us and they will be visible to us.If we make sense, then we have one text file and one binary file. Now here we will mostly work on text files because we do not know how to code in binary. But if we go to write C code, then with C we can edit binary files too, we can read, write, close, open everything, but from the exam point of view or from the interview point of view, mostly the things that will be asked to us will be from the text file.
