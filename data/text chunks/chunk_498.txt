character but one.The special thing in this is that a null character is also stored at the end, i.e. if 2006 is the last letter at the memory location, then 2007 will also be a part of our string, inside which we will be storing the base 0, which is our null character, so in this way our string which is stored inside the memory, now let s try a practice question. Our question says that cut a string first name and last.Name i.e. two strings have to be created here, one has to be named first name, one has to be named last name to store the details of the user and print all the characters using a loop, that is, we have to create a string from the first name name, inside which we can store any value, like suppose we have stored Shraddha, then we will create another string from the name last name, we can also store any value inside the last name, suppose we have stored Khap and now we print both these values.We will get it done in the form of a loop.
