them.So call both of them. After calling both of them, add both of them and store them in fina of n. So in this way, we write the code for our different finaza numbers. By writing the code, we will understand better. The return type of this function is Int. At every level, it will extract its fina of nth number and return it to the upper levels. Let us name it fi and it will extract the fina sequence for int n. Now.Let s define this function int fina of number a then what is the rule of fina so this is Banachi s rule Fina of the last two numbers take out what numbers were in the sequence and add both of them then int fina of n e to fina of n myve plus fina of n 2 Now let s do this fina of n 1 and n 2 first then call int fina of n myve e fi for n myve thenThis function is calling itself i.e. recalculation is taking place. Here we had to calculate for n, so first we made a call for n might and stored it in this variable. Now we will make another call to get fina of n 2 as fia of n 2.
