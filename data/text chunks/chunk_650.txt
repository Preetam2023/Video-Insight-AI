getting that data, in the same way it keeps getting scanned by f scanf i.e. it keeps getting input. We can check it once with the code also in our test.L is what has been written and saved and we want to read a character from our file, so what will we do first of all, let s create a character C, now we will scan F, in which we will first pass the file pointer, after that we will pass our specified format i.e. percentage C and after that we will print the address of our variable, the address of C. Now we will print whatever variable we have read, the character is equal to percentage C and we will print this character C and at the end.
