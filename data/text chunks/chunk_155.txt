e same code print F and here I am writing hello, okay, hello, and here we do an increment, you guys.And then here we write while aa is lesson 10, okay and we have declared aa also, look i is 10, here first I gave 10 to aa, then this do loop happened, so see one task here, now my loop will run once, it is written aa, hello once, it is written, why because what happens is that first of all I went to do, then the code did not see that there is a condition, it has already printed something, after that it saw the condition, then this is the only difference.If I normally do some things here like suppose I give a, the value of one is fine and once we hide the do while loop and run our normal while loop, then you have understood what its code will be i1, then one will be printed, two print three print four will go till i9, mine will write hello nine times. If you want, I can show you here by doing it, let s give it like this, okay look, I will run it and hello will come again.
