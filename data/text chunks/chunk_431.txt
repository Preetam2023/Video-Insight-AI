of the array. After that on the right side we write curly braces and all the elements inside it i.e. if we have written three elements then it means we are creating an array of three sizes. Now either we can follow this syntax or we can also write the size then thisBoth the syntax are absolutely correct when we declare as well as initialize our array that an array named marks will be created, what will happen inside it, the first value will come here, the second value will come here, the third value will come here, this will be our zeroth position, this is the first position and this is the second position in this first position. The size of the int will be four bytes, the second will also be of four bytes and the third will also be of four bytes because the integer takes four bytes.
