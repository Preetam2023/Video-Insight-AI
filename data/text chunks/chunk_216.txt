o n, then do the initialization statement. Get it done from three to n, then in any way in this way.The code will be in that way we will be adopting and overcoming. Next thing we will talk about is our do while loop. Do while loop is exactly like the while loop. Now the condition inside the while loop is already checked i.e. if we talk about the while loop then what used to happen in the while, first while while was written then our condition was written. So if this condition is false then we would never be going inside this block like int aa e.Equal to, we have written one and the condition is being checked, i is equal to then else and will never be true, that is why the statements inside will never be executed, otherwise our while loop will not run even once, but if we write such a while loop which will always run once in the list, we call it do while, then there are different cases of do while loop in which using it makes more sense.
