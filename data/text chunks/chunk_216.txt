3 2 1, so you have to print this.You also have to print the factorial of 3, then the factorial of 4. You have to print 4 3 in 2, that s right, f is equal to 24 and then you have to print the factorial of 5, 5 4 3 2 1 e 120. If n is 5, then if n is 10, then you have to print the factorials of all, so essentially you have to show this on the output screen, like this 6 24120 720 And so on, all the factorials have to be printed as far as I have given n, okay, so how to do this, friend, think about it, I mean, will I run the same code again and again, that is, there is one way to do it, which you don t do, that is, nested loops are okay, like nested false, we will also read nested loops, specifically what are we going to read when the next video which is going to come, our very nice pattern printing, okay?If we will study this thing in pattern printing, then here, how will we solve this code, then there is a way to solve our nested loop, but we will see later, now look at an amazing thing,
