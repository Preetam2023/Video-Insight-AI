herever the call is made, if the return value comes back to the same place, then we will return a b. So let us look at this function carefully. First of all, we told the return type is int, so we returned a b. From here, if weEven if we had returned 1 2 12, no error would have occurred because ultimately it has to return an integer. This would have been logically wrong because a could be zero.Return the value of pi or some other value or suppose we try to return any character, then after that we will be getting error because returning those values is not allowed. If you return even 3.14, then it will return only three, it will not send the complete 3.1, so here we will return a b, that is why we should know our turn type in advance and these integers a and integer b, we need to take edge parameters inside our function.If they are matching then from here we call Sum a and b.
