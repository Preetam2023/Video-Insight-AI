then the condition will be checked again. So in this way our for loop keeps running in this circle. Once we actually write it in the code and see how we will do it, first of all we will write for for. Our key word is for loop. After that we will write the initialization statement i.e. int i 1. In a way, we have written a mini statement. Inside our for loop, there is a combination of three mini statements.First of all, our for loop will come in the initial statement which we have initialized i to is, after that we will write our condition under which condition, if our loop runs then there is a condition of i 5, then we will write update. In update, we can write i i 1 and here what we can do now is we will print F. Hello world, let s save it and let s run it once and see what is the output. We have the output that is.This is Hello World, after that once again our Hello World has been printed.
