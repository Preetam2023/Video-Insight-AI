ery simple question, is it a very simple question?You just have to use loop and if else, you are fine, this is a hint, now try it yourself, I hope you must have tried, this is a very simple question, let s solve it, first thing, what have you given me, up to n, up to n terms, basically these are the terms, friend, I don t know whether n will be preceded by plus or minus, what is meant to say is assume that the value of n is a. If it is sane then what do I have to do? One 2 3 4 5 6 7 So I have to find out the answer and print it. Suppose if the value of n was 4 then I have to do 1 2 3 4. So see in the last our minus can also come plus can also come in that eighth term so one thing is clear that our number of terms is number of terms so here we have n.
