f there are no concepts of object orientation in it, then we cannot create classes and objects here. They are similar to structures but we cannot create them, that is why we shift to languages like C P or Java in which we can go and create classes or objects. Now a complete course of C P is already made according to the placement and a complete course of Java is also made according to the placement in which there is a lot of information.Advanced topics have been covered i.e. from the very basic to installation of editor to how variables are there in C PS, from how variables are there in Java to the very end like data structures and algorithms, the topics have been covered in those playlists. By going to T, we can explore whatever language we want to move ahead in.
