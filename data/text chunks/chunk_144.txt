same statement in the code here. If our age is greater than 18 in that case.We want to print adult . We will look at this statement a little carefully. First of all, we have written the if keyword to check the if condition. Inside we have written our condition. The condition of ours was that the age should be greater than 18, only then the person whose age we have taken is an adult. So, we had already read how to use the relational operator. We will compare this constant with the variable that age is our variable 18, which is ourConstant is greater than or not and if this statement becomes true, if this condition becomes true, then in that case we will execute whatever is written here, so it is written here adult, so if this condition becomes true, then we will have adult printed in the screen, but suppose this condition becomes false and in that case, we want to print not adult, then what will we do, we will write else in this way and then also that.
