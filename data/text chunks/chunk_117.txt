be studying in the next semesters. So the table is made that first expression and second expression.If we have something like this, then what will be the final output? First expression is true, second is also true, then the output will be true. If we are talking about the end, first is true, second is false, then the output is false, first is false, second is true, then the output is false, first is false, second is also false, then the output will be false. So this is a small table by which we can visualize a little how our outputs come whenever we talk about logical end.Next we are going to talk about logical and. There is a symbol of pipe inside our keyboard, that is, it is a symbol of a straight line. When we write it twice, it becomes our logical and operator. Now the single pipe is also an operator, that is. Here we are talking about logical statement.
