paste this code from the prime number, first copy and paste this code once, it is a different code.But no problem, why write things again and again, I told you about do not repeat yourself , it is okay inside the loop, so of course, here also we will take the number as input, enter the number, we will write all the things, we will not take it because we have to run the straight loop, we would have written it from the beginning, let s come from one, we will run it from one to 100, we want till 100, okay and we will see if my aa is divisible by two, not equal.To 0 First of all, once I show you this code again, then I can simply write, what print F Percentage D space is okay here and this is the next thing that is removed, otherwise we run this code further. Look at this code 1 579 99, all the odd numbers have been printed. Now we could have done this question with the continue statement also. How to pay attention, I can write here if a modulus is equal to two.
