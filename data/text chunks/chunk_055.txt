, if I write here that I have to print first 100 code numbers, take brother, first 100, these numbers are printed, this one is ours, we are printed, let s move towards the next question, the next question is given display this AP 4 7 10 13 16 up to end terms up to end terms, so again a little bit here and our maths is going to be done which is going to happen in maths.Also, I will show you this question which you don t understand for some reason or a, still I will tell you how to do it, here I can see my AP is 4 7 10 13 16 ok so off course you can see the difference is of t, so here I will see the first term a is f, my common difference is our r so a term we can take out from this formula by doing a p n 1 d.Meaning first second third 10th 100th then how much will our a of n become? From here a is our 4, 4 p n 1 3, so in a generalized way our thing is coming here whose value is 4 p 3n 3 so 3n 1.
