what did the C compiler do? First of all, it will check that the file is C which defines the rules.Is it following all the syntax defined by it? Is there any mistake in it? Is there any error in it? Our variable name has not been started with a number, we have only put an underscore in the beginning, so it checks the basic errors of this method and if there are errors, then it fails the compilation. But if our file gets compiled, it means there are no syntax errors in it and after that itThe compiler converts it into windows.exe file and you can create dsi in linux.com and dot out in viz too, but by default the extension you are seeing will be this extension inside your machine, so there is no need to worry. If you are seeing dot out on my screen and you are seeing dotsy on your screen, then now we have understood the basic basic concepts of C and till now we have got some idea.
