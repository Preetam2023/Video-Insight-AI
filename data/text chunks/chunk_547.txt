password and double its size. So, first of all we have to copy our password inside the new password. Then if we want to copy our salt, then first of all we use the string copy function. STTR CPY. What will we pass as the first string in the string copy? First string will we pass our new password and the second string will be our password. So what will ATR CPY do? It will copy the value of our password by putting it inside the new password and after that we will call STTR CT. Now we will connect.That is, inside the new password, we want to concatenate our salt. What did it do? We put the old password in the new password. What did the test and concatenate do? It made the value of the new password test plus 123, so this test will become 123. Now we will get this printed. The new password is a small function for the saltini and you are able to write this very complex function yourself, which means you have a good level of logic.
