econ is that just like we have all the infinities in the item and after that our program will crash. Similarly, if Recon continues to run again and again and there is no base case in it, then we call that condition as stack overflow. The basic meaning of stack overflow is that our memory is filled and now our program will crash, that is why base case is very important whenever we talk about recon.And whenever we are writing a calculation program, we should never forget the base case, like for example, in the factorial case code, if I remove this base case and suppose I am printing it every time, this is what I am calculating, I am calculating the factorial of A, where I have to print the value of A every time, I save it and run it once, here my program has crashed at the end andSegmentation fault is printed. Segmentation fault has happened because I have not written the condition in the recension. Let s run it once again. This is segmentation fault. Program crashes.
