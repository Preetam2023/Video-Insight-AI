ing with the file, then you must close the file because the resources of your system are being lost. If your system is getting slow by opening the file, then the system sTo increase efficiency, you have to always close your files so that the compiler knows that the work on the file here is finished, so now we do not have to do any work but we close our file and write here pay f close and will pass the file pointer f ptr inside. So what happened here, the file was opened, we did not have to do any work, so we simply closed the file here with pay f close. Next let s talk about what is in the file.In what modes can we open any file? Now the first mode we read was the r one, that is, we are opening the file to read it. The second one is our RB. If we open it in RB mode, then the file is read in binary format, so it will usually be for binary files.
