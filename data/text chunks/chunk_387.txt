sk has to be remembered. Whenever the value has to be calculated, M percentage has to be remembered. How will Aris be useful? We know what Star PTR gives. Star PTR gives us i 5.Value i.e. five gives us, then if we do Star PPR then what will it give us? Star PPR will give us what is stored inside this address, that means from Star PTR we will come here and come to the value stored at this address, but if we do Star Star PPR, what will happen then a chain will run. How will the chain run? First of all, with the help of this first star, we will come here from 2010 and will come on this 2000 of the second star.From the help, we will come here from 2000 and then come to this five, then we have to do double double star means value at address twice, by jumping the values twice, after that we can print our i 5. Let s try it practically with the help of the code. If it is not so clear yet, comment out this portion. Let s create a variable int aa inside which five is stored.
