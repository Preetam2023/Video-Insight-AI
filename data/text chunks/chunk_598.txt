t it read this line and then read this line. Here it got confused that integer is a float character. So I knew what this struct student is till now because it has not read the struct student, that is why the structure is declared first and after that we can use it in other different functions or in fact in our main.Inside the function also, here we have declared our function, let s define it here. Inside this function, we are going to print all our three values. If we ever want to print student s information, then we will call this function. Here we write another print F statement above student information. This time we will use dot operator, we will not be using arrow operator, here we write dot roll number s1.Let s call this print info function for the name and our s1 cp1. Here we have already created a s1. Now we will call the print info and pass it to our s1. So here we passed the edge argument to s1 and inside this s1, our argument will be copied.
