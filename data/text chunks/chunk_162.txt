se, if it is not the break from the switch.If it happens then all these statements will be executed. If one switch is turned on and you have not written break then all the switches will be turned on. After that, break means that if you have written all the switches. If you don t want to turn on then that is the default behavior. If you don t turn on all the switches then break after the first switch and lastly our case is a default case that if none of the above is true then do this thing. Now it is like our else that if none of the above if else or else if is true then execute your else. The default is the else of the switch. Now let s take an example of this.What will we do inside the example? We are going to take input from the user. Day means int day. We will take input from the user. What is the meaning of day here? One means Monday, two means Tuesday, three means Wednesday and so on. We have asked the user to enter the number of days till seven.
