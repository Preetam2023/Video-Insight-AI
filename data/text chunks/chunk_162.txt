o me? The condition is something like this, when my number becomes zero, then I have to end the loop. Apart from this, it means that if any initial condition is not given, then it is given that the value of the number has been given, but int aa and aa have nothing to do with us here. I is the variable that we use.Neither the extra variable nor it has anything to do with it. Okay, and the increment decrement thing. Here let me explain to you what is happening. So when you don t know anything then use the while loop. So, can t we write the code like this, let me show it by coding, isn t it, it is getting boring, okay, here we create a file inside the loops, what is its name, dot C with the name count digits, okay and here we write everything back as ours, include std dot, then int main, then here we write return zero and write our code, so first of all, suppose I have a number int n and I will take its input from the user.
