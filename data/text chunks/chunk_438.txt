as the address of age. Now we have done this, first of all let s make PTR plus plus plus plus here.Got it done and before that let s print the value of PTR, PTR is equal to percentage unsigned int, we will show it in control C and again let s run the value of PTR, so first of all the value of PTR which was printed is 18 22802 and after that the last one which was printed was 156. Now if you look carefully, it will be within 152 and 156.What is the difference? If there is a difference of four, then we can understand that as soon as we did plus plus, what is the value. The integer increased by the size of the integer, that is, it increased by four bytes. Now here, if we again do minus minus PTR minus minus and then again print the value of PTR, then firstly the value of the pointer was this in which the last one was coming 112, after that if we did PTR plus plus then it came 116.
