mple again aa, you have started it from one, what do you write till here that it is going to a only.And aa plus ps is happening ok but which one will you print, you make a a variable int a which will be your first term which is one in this case and then you change a again and again, every time a is being multiplied by two, ours is very good, let s print it once and let s see it is working, ours will be exactly like that, enter number 10, take brother 1 2 4 up to the power of two, whatever is nine.Our 512 is printed, okay, so this is a better method, you can always use extra variables, nothing is going on, only one extra box is being used, memory is okay, let s go ahead, let s give a homework, friend, this is your homework, display this GP up to the end terms, the same end terms have to be done, but this time our GP is 3 12 48, so you have to copy paste this code which I just told you the code.Just here I had written a 1 and inside the loop I had done a a 2.
