If they are declared inside C, then declare them together, but their values and their usage will be discussed later. The next type of instructions that exist inside C is our Arithm that instructions. Arithm is a word that we must have read in 11th, 12th, 10th or 6th to 8th maths.Arithmetic means we understand that where plus minus multiply divide all this is going on i.e. basically all the things related to maths then if we see any statement of math like suppose we take the example of a b then inside it the things on which the operation is performed i.e.
