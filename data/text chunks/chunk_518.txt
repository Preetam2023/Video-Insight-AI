an define it in this way. We will put Hello World in it too. By putting Hello World, we can test it. We can not change it ifIf we want to change the value of Can Not Change yesterday, then hello, now this C compiler will not let us do it and will show a red line because the expression must be a modified force value which is our character array, when the array notation comes then we cannot modify it, that value will remain the same but if you wanted to modify or change then you should have used character pointer, there is a slight difference whenever youWe declare the string with a character pointer or array notation. The next thing we will talk about is that we have to solve question number 49 in this. Make a program that inputs the user s name. Inputs the user s name and prints its length. We have to take a string from the user whose name will be the user s name and then we will input its length. Like for example, we create a string called character name.
