which we feel that any information is sensitive or we do not want to pass this information outside.If you do not want to pass it outside your class, then we can make it private in a way, that is, now it will not be possible to access that information outside the class and to make any article private, what we do is simply put two underscores in front of it, what we did is put two underscores and this thing now becomes private, so here if I try to access this thing i.e. account 1 Dr account password when we will now try to access it andIf we run this then in this case we will get the error Account object has no attribute account password so basically this thing has now become private, we cannot access it outside the class.
