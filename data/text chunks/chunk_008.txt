algorithms so and also Alpha uh T makes the um for a mix the learning rate uh learning rate changes at each Epoch here like this so this is making the converging uh faster than other algorithms so advantages of this other grid is here no manual tuning is needed for alpha alpha and uh due to giving different Alpha rates for uh different parameters for each iteration making the faster convergence and more reliable one of the disadvantages here when Alpha T is becoming large suppose uh the ETA E30 is inversionally proportional to Alpha T okay so when Alpha T becomes larger value for example we are giving 5 or 50 like that so when it is increasing like this the ETA T will become less okay so it needs more number of iterations when you are getting very minimum value here you see E30 is very less than you will get many minimum updation minimum change in the new weight value so it makes overseer convergence uh to reach the uh value the cost close to the zero so this is one of the main advanta
