odd, whether it is odd, whether it is odd.As soon as there is an odd, increase the count by one i.e. count plus plus and what will we do in the end, we will return our count, we make an array inside the main function, int array is equal to 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 and print the count, count dot, we will pass our array and our size which is s, save and run, so we have three returns, that means three inside our array.Odd numbers are present. In the same way, you can make a function to calculate even numbers. In the same way, you can make a function to calculate the multiple of three. If you calculate the multiple of five, then different types of functions will be written in the same way. If we have to perform functions on an array, then the next question which we will talk about is that we have an integer array given, numbers are stored inside it. 1 2 3 4 5 The question is for the given.Array what will be the following, so first of all we have to extract this value.
