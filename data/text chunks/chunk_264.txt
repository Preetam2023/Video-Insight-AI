x of the declaration. The second syntax that we are talking about is the definition of the function. Once we have told the compiler that our function exists, after that weYou will have to write the function, then show somewhere how the function works, then we call that statement. Function definition and its syntax is this. First of all, we write the return type, i.e. what value it will return, what is its type, so it will not return anything here, that is why void is written, then we will write the name of our function print hello, then we will write parenthes, after that will come our curly braces, so this is the block inside which all our code will exist.Here, because we only have to print hello, we will write a single line, print A, inside which we will write hello, so in this way our function definition is also covered. Now the third syntax that we talk about is function call.
