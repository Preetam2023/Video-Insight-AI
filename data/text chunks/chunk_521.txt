ect here.From this our length will be returned, so we write int as int count length character array. Now we have to keep counting the characters for length till our null character comes, so we have already made the loop in this way. When the string was printed character by character, what was done was in a way, we went to every character till the null comes, then here also every character will be counted till the null character comes, then a variable.Let s create a count which will start from zero and then write a loop for int aa 0. As long as our array of aa is not equal to our null character, we will keep doing i as plus plus. So I hope it will be understood that we will start i with zero and will keep increasing aa till the null character comes. Now what will we do every time? If we make the count also plus plus then we will make the count also plus plus every time because.
