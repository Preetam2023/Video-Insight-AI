tore how many children are enrolled in your class, then suppose there are 30 children in your class.And you have created an array according to 30 children, but in the middle of the year, three new children enroll in your class, then for that, will you create a new array whose size will be 33, in it you will copy the old values and also copy the new values, then this becomes a bit tricky situation in which a lot of energy is wasted, that is why we need dynamic memory allocation because there is a way by which we can decide in the middle of the program.How much memory do we need? If we had taken less earlier then we can increase it. If we had taken more earlier then we can reduce that memory in the middle of the program to save resources. So in dynamic i.e. run time we will be able to decide how much memory is to be allocated. So dynamic memory allocation is to allocate memory to a data structure during the run time.
