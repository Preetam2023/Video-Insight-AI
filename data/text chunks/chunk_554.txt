t and run. So there is a space here because in Hello World, we have given a space without any space. If we try again with Hello World, then this isOur string from index 3 to index 6 got cut and came back to us after getting sliced, we got it printed, so we have created a slice function and all the questions we are practicing, more than this, our logical thinking is getting built up, that is, C programming programming is not about syntax, we have learned how to declare a string like this or we have learned how to declare an integer like this.This is how we print it. Programming is about the logic. Whatever language you use, the logic remains the same. Now you can write this slice function in C P, you can also write it in Java, you can also write it in JavaScript, you can write it in C, in Go, in Python, in whatever language you want. The logic will remain the same, you will have to put a for loop, inside it you will have to copy things like this and then you can get it printed.
