mind very well. First of all, let s enter our first number. Now we have to understand it logically. Now do not pay attention to what is written in the code, we just have to understand the logic. We should not look at this code like a small calculator of the user.We can first put the first number in the calculator, let s say F. After that, put the second number in the calculator. We put three. Now what is printed, it is printed for us, Sum is A. This is printed here, we do a little good formatting once more and run it. First of all, we put four in our first number, that is, in the calculator, we put four, after that we put our second number, two, so the sum is six. It is printed for us, so our calculator has done the job now.Let us understand how the calculator is working internally. There is a function inside the calculator whose name is sum. In it, it has taken integer a and integer b, so we have taken our a and b and called it sum.
