e taken the name of that box here, number, similarly if we want to store any character, care star e.Equal to star, so inside our memory, we stored the star which is made on our keyboard in the memory and we gave the name of that container of that variable as star. In the same way, if we have to store the edge, then we will write int a e equal to 22, so here we have stored our edge 22 inside the memory and we have named that location as edge. What is this int here, what is this character, we will ignore it for now and pay attention.Just on this line, suppose we have to store any decimal value, then we will write float Pa 3.14, so our value of Pi is 3.14, this too has now been stored inside the memory and we have given the name of that container to that memory location, Pi, so in this way, we can store any number, any value inside our memory and we can remember the name of the container where it is stored, so we can call themNow there are some rules for writing variables in C.
