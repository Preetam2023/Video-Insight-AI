formulas are based on different cases. Look at what I mean. Let me try to explain something to you. Whenever we have an even number of terms, let s say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 is okay. So what is the number of terms here n my.It is equal to eight. In this case, we divide it into groups. It can always be divided into groups of two. Look, it is divided into this group, into this group, and in this group, so clearly, I can write this as 1 plus I can write this also as 1. Then this will also become my 1. 5 6. You see what I am saying. 7 8 will also become 1, so at the end my answer will become 4. Now notice how many times this is 1, four times and what is four?It is 8 2, so here is our direct formula. Now if you want, you can assume it instead of 8. If it was not n 6, then all these things would have happened, then our answer would have been 3. Okay, if n 10, the answer would have been 5.
