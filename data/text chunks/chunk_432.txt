also be of four bytes and the third will also be of four bytes because the integer takes four bytes. Now if yours is a 32 bit machine or you are working on some other system then it may be that the size of the int according to your machine may be two bytes or something else but according to my machine the size of the int is four bytes, so whenever someone asks you to do the calculation, tell me the size, how much does it take?So you can adjust the int to four bytes or you may have given it inside the question or you can also ask the interviewer or teacher to tell me the size of the integer. As per the machine, there is no problem in it because the size can be different but inside this class we will carry four bytes, so if we have to find out the total memory reserve, how much memory is reserved by this array, then it will be our 12 bytes because it takes memory to store three integers.
