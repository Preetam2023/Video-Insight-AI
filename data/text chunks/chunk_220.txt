es have to be printed from f to one, so what do we do by initializing i and writing it here with fv.i becomes my minus termination statement i As long as greater than is equal to 1, we save it and run, now it is printed 54321, so in this way we can use increment decrement, from where to where we have to go, we can understand its code, so this was our do while loop, our question says print the sum of first n natural numbers, so first of all they will print the first part, after that they will be looking at the second part, so we have to print the sum of the first n natural numbers.Like every time, the user will give us this n, then we will print their sum. Suppose the user has given n 4, then we have to print the sum of all the numbers from one to 4. We will have 10. If the user has given five, then the same is from one to five. We will have to print the sum of all the numbers from one to five. If three has been given, then the same is 1 2 3 6.
