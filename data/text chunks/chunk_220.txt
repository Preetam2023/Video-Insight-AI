the factorial of one is one, okay, we went ahead, then our two will be printed, let s see this code.Enter a number, I say five, then see 1 2 6 24 120, everyone s factorials are printed, let s move ahead, write here enter number six 1 2 24 120 120, okay, 720, sorry, now here factorial has been written again and again, once let us assume that we have to write this number in the code, like the factorial of five is this, then simply you can do one thing.You can play on the value of key, look at the factorial of percentage d is percentage d and here we can bring the first aa as comma product. You are understanding this percentage d, this is denoting this aa and this percentage d is denoting my product. Let s run this code once and see, back I write 6 then look at the factorial of w is w and the two is 3 e 6 4 e 24.5 is 120 6 is 720 So how simple was the code? There was no difference in it. No dear, I had given you this homework, but I still tried to show it to you. Let s write it here.
