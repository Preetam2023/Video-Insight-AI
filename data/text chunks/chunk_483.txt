beThree means this one will be three and two, then its value will come, we will have five and so on. Now let s run it and see that we have to enter 10 FINA numbers, so these 10 FINA numbers have come to us. In this, the first two have not been printed, that is, we have not printed Row and One yet. For that, we can put a separate print statement here. Apart from Row and One, there are remaining eight FINA numbers. First one came, then two came, then three came, then five came.Then came eight, this is our five, then again came sixth, 13, seventh came 21 and eighth, we have 34. So in this way, we can print the extra number of fobo chi numbers for the different difference which is the value of n and I hope that how we did it with recursion and how we did it with it i.e. loop, we must have understood the difference between those two. The next question which we will talk about is create a 2d.
