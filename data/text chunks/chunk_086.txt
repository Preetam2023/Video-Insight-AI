t have any other factors, so what do we have to do, we have to take input from the user, a number n. Okay, so we have to make a program which will tell us by writing that if we have entered n, then it should write that yes, this number is prime or else it should come by writing that this number is composite. Composite is the one which is not prime, as we had done in the first question in the if statement, odd andTo find even number, here we are talking about finding prime or composite number, but how did this question come inside my for loop, it is a matter of thinking, okay, so here I will tell you the working rule of it, I will anchor it a little, I can just give you a hint that through for loop and another hint that we will solve this question by dividing through factors, now you pause.
