stored, then it will make it zero. Whereas if we had taken 2.0, then we would have taken it as 2.0.Now we have a float value in the output. What is the output in float value? It gives us 0.666 667. So if we want exact output, then for that we will make any one of them float, but if we want that whatever part of the decimal is completely removed, then we will make it an integer. So, we can divide three with two. Whenever we divide three with two, then our output here will beShould come close to an integer value, one will come in the output, but if we divide 3.0 by two, then one will not come in the output. Let us also change this to f. Now we will get 1.5 in the output. So when we want an exact answer then we have to make float when we have to remove the decimal exactly. If we want a then we will make it an integer, then the type conversion is done in this way. A very interesting question based on type conversion will be solved now.
