ator. Now the single pipe is also an operator, that is. Here we are talking about logical statement. What does logical statement do? If we give two statements or three statements or any number of statements and put a logical and in between them, then if even one of them becomes true, then the output will come to us as true. Rest of the rest may be false but if even one is true, then the output will come true, otherwise all the statements will be false, then the output will come out false. So if we try to write its code, then first of all we have 3, 4, which is one.There is a false statement right here, if we add and and write and 5 gr d 2, then this statement here is false. This statement is true, so in the output we had false, but in else we will have true, so its own table can also be made. In the table, if we take the first and second expression and then analyze the final output, then here if true is given then the output will be true.
