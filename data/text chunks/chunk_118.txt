th the continue statement also. How to pay attention, I can write here if a modulus is equal to two.Equal to G, so it means even numbers will be printed. Look, all the numbers from two to 100, now see one thing, here I write it, instead of this we remove it and here I write Co. New Country New, okay and outside I write this thing. Okay, for one turn, we remove this too. Assume that if I just print F, then all the numbers from one to 100 will be printed. Look, from one to 100, because I just print it.Gave it and ran it from one to 100, now what I just wrote is that if look at my number, if my number is even, because what does it mean, it is an even number, then if my number here is even, then I just said continue, so now let s see what the result will be, see 57, how come, when I have written this print statement outside, look, whatever this statement is, it should not have anything to do with it, all the numbers should be printed, let s dry run it once and after fully disclosing it.
