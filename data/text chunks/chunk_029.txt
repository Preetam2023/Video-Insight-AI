Do you understand clearly friend, so this is our difference.Now as the value of i becomes three, then as soon as it becomes three, the update is done, then we go back here. Check condition, is my three less than 10, it is true, go inside the loop, Hello World, then it is printed, ok, Hello World, now similarly, we went ahead, I am telling you slowly but understand that if you have understood more things, then skip this part, go ahead. As soon as we printed it here, then we wrote update update i i 2 So i current value of i is 3 So then 3 2 5 So this time i becomes 5 instead of going four Similarly then it will be sane Look first it became five Now date e value then check the condition again Is it smaller than 510 Of course it is smaller than 510 Go inside the loop and print Hello World quietly Then update the value again This time it will be sane Then check again againIf the condition is
