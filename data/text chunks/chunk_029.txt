atever are our special characters, like it is hashed, it is rated on M, it has become star, that is.At risk, we store all of them in character data type. For the character, we have to write care and here suppose we write our shag. So here first of all we have to write single quote to store the characters and inside we can write our character. So in this way we have stored a variable of care data type, we have done care of float, we have done it of int. For now, because we are working from the basic level, these three are the main ones.We need to remember the rest, we will keep learning more with time. Now the next topic which we will talk about is our constants. Earlier we had talked about what was the issue in the variable, the value of the variable could have changed.
