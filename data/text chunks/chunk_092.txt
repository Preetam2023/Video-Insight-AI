itor used to be in the school, we used to say that the post of monitor has been assigned to him i.e. it has been given to him, then whenever we give a value, we call it assignment, so if We have written a b c, so we have assigned the value of a b inside c, so in this way we understand the meaning of the things inside c. Now let s see an example, if x 4 9 10 is written, then how will we solve it. First of all, we will see whether 4 9 should be done first or 9 10. Obviously, the precedence of our multiply is high, so 9 10 first.If we do 9 10, we get 90. Now if we add four to it, then if we add four, then our answer of 94 will be stored insideWe have done the right thing inside int A, we will store 4 p 9 in 10, let s run it and in the output we have got 94. Now whatever expressions we have in one and the other way can be written, then this is the case with us, operations of same president i.e.
