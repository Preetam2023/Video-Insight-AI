y condition, meaning as we come here, I saw that 25 modus 2 is equal to rho, meaning what is two to.Is divisible by 25 No is divisible by three No is by four No is by five Yes so as soon as I say yes then I can print it So can I print it What can I print that the number is composite and when it is not divisible then I can just move ahead I can skip Okay, there is no need to do anything meaningful here So let s come here to see what I want to do, I just write for int i into two right nowI will make a mistake on purpose, I have to start from two, what do I have to do, pay attention from two i e i n 1 From two to a number, just divide all the numbers by that number, because the factors of a number, keep in mind that they are factors, what is the meaning of prime number, the number has only two factors, n and if n is a number, then if there are any other factors of a composite number, then they bring the meaning inside it.
