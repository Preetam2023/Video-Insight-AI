with the help of this PTR we can access the memory and assign values in it. We can print its values. Let s write the code once and see. For the first time, we will change the memory we have allocated in Calc. Now we will not assign anything in Calc, meaning we will not write one, we will write three, we will not do all these assignments and we will simply see what will be printed. For us, we have to pass it here.Two parameters will be one, our total number of slots do we need, one will be what will be the size of each block, so for every value we get 0.0 whereas if we do this memory with malloc and then try to run it, now here in this case our malloc has also printed 0.0 but it is not necessary, meaning it does not give any guarantee that our program will print only 0.0 every time. It is possible that there may be something in those blocks of memories.Get a random number printed for you, the clerk in your system will never guarantee that only 0.
