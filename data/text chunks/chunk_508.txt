their first name and print it back to them. This is very much.This is easy, we have already done it. I think, now here we just change the variable a little, name it first name, copy it, then this will also become our first name and this will also become our first name, save it and run it once again. Suppose this time the first name we have entered is Aman, so it gets printed here, your name is Aman. Now the second part is more interesting, it is written in the second part.Try this with your full name. Till now you have entered the first name. Now enter the full name i.e. first name as well as last name. Let s check that part. Comment out this part and create a new string. Character full name of 100 characters. First of all we will scan the full name as percentage. A full name. After that we will print it. Your full name is the percentage of full name. Now let s save it and run it.
