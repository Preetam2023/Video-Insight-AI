then got them printed. Now what will we do, we will reallocate this memory to reallocate the memory.We will write PTR equal to relc, we will put our old pointer inside relc and along with it the new size will be the new size. We will have six and now in the same location we will print even numbers and PTR of 5 12 and the same values. We will print this code. Save this code once and run it. So first of all we have even numbers printed on the screen. Then all the odd numbers are printed. What is the special thing to see?Found that the size i.e. PTR of five which we were not able to access earlier, we are able to access it in the same code. This thing which is increasing or decreasing in size, we cannot see it with Erus, we can see it only with Dynamic Daily Allocated Memory. So when such a situation arises that we have to allocate memory dynamically, then in those situations we will have to use Re allocate and which memory.
