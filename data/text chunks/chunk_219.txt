roduct became two. Look, after i 3, the value of the product became 6s. Value of the product at i 4.It became 24, at i 5 the value of the product became 120, so the value is coming again and again but I am just not printing it. Okay, so if I print my product here in the code, if I print it here only then there will be no problem. No, see what I want to say, what do I want to do, do nothing. What I have written here is a statement like print F, cut it and write it once here, let s see if it works.Well, suppose I have written here the factorial is this and I also put an enter again and again, our two is going to be printed because okay, so see what happened here, the value of the product is one, so I went to i1, first of all, the product is equal to 1 1 one, then print F, the factorial is one, the factorial of one is one, okay, we went ahead, then our two will be printed, let s see this code.
