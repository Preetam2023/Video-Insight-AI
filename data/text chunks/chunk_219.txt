doo, what will it do?Now we should have the variable ready to work, so let s initialize it with one. Our work is to print the variable, so to get it printed, we will write percentage d n i and then we will write our while in while, then we will write the condition, what is our condition, until the value of i remains equal to 5 and then our statement terminator, we will keep printing i and every time iWe will convert i into plus plus because if i is not plus then what will become of us again? So the value of i will always be less than f, hence every time the condition will be true, the loop will run. Every time the condition will be true, if the loop will run, then by going to one of the infindings, after running run, we got the output 1 2 3 4 5. Here, the values have to be printed from f to one, so what do we do by initializing i and writing it here with fv.
