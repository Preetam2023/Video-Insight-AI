name and then we will input its length. Like for example, we create a string called character name. Suppose the string is 100 in size.First of all, we will take input of string from F gate and write name 100 and after that std in or for simplicity, we will enter only the first name, we will not enter the last name because there is a space in between, so we will not have the hassle of space, we will enter only the first name. Now we have to print its length, so suppose the user has inputted us S H R A D A and the compiler has automatically put back slash 0 behind it, so what should we print?We have to get it printed, we have to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 If we do not count this backs last zero, then the length that should come after getting printed should come to us. If the user has entered aman, in this also back slush zero will come, the length should come to us. What should come to us is the length. We should have four, so the null character should not be counted.
