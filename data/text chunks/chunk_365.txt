red the same here, so 22 got printed and came to us, so the syntax of our pointer works in this way. Now what do we do, let s talk in a little detail about how we declare the points. We are reading everything very basic and very easily. I am trying to explain everything once or twice because it helps in getting the things stuck in the mind.Then you will not need to revise again and again. We hear the same thing two three times and it gets stuck in our mind. Now first of all, when we declare pointers, the type of pointer to be declared depends on which variable you want to point to, meaning if you store the address of an integer variable then you will have to write int star ptr, if you want to use character.If you want to store the address of a variable, you will have to write character star ptr. If you want to store the address of a floating variable inside the pointer, you will have to write float star ptr i.e. int edge e equal.
