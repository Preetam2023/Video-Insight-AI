o print it five times. We save this code and run it in the terminal, so hello world will come to us.Hello World Hello World is printed five times. Once we format it, Hello World is printed five times in the next line. Now if we had written 10 here, if we had written 10 and saved it, Hello World would have been printed 10 times. Now what did this function do? Print Hello World is a function, it is calling itself within itself, that is, it is calling Print Hello World and because of this call, again and again, aThe function is printing Hello World only once, so this function calls itself five times and prints Hello World again and again, so this is a recurse function and we have just seen the example of Recurse. Let us understand Recurse with the help of a little math. Now those children who did not like Math in school, they may find it a little boring but we will not teach boring Math. Here we will have a very small discussion as if we used to have functions inside Math.
