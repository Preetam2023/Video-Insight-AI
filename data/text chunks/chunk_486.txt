the number is which table is to be printed, let us copy this and again what to do in the first row.We have to print a table of three, here instead of the array, we will pass our 2D array of tables. So first of all, what we did was create a 2D array named tables whose size is 2 10 i.e. there are two arrays inside it and the size of each array is 10. Then we created a function called store table which stores a table of one number. This D array will take which array are we talking about i.e. our row and which column, we mean which one.Are we getting the table of second number printed? Is it on the number of third number or on the fourth number and which number table is to be printed on the table of two? Three has to be printed. Five has to be printed. We have started a loop which will go from row to m. Here the value of m which we are passing is 10. So this is the loop. It will go from row to 10 and after doing all the multiplications it will get the table stored.
