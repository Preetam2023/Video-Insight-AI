this will become our iter for our loop and every time we will decrease the value i.e. i minus minus. We would have written the code for this also.We will get the user to enter the numbers and after that we are going to print our number table. So for int, this time we will initialize our item meter with our numbers or sorry, initialize the item meter with 10 and then i till the greater than equal to 1 will go i minus minus and every time we will be printing the percentage d by n number multiplied by i. Let s save it and let s run it.We will enter our number two, then the complete table of two has been printed to us, starting from 20 and ending at two, so in this way we can print the tables in reverse order also. The last question which we will be discussing in this chapter is called Calculate the Sum of All Numbers Between 5 and 50 including 5 and 50 i.e. 5 and 50 also.We have to count the sum of all the numbers from five to 50. We have to calculate it and get it printed on the screen.
