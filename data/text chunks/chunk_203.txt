three pairs will be formed. One is our only lone pair, which is called this, it will be left alone. Ours is fine, but what is amazing is that in computers, 7 divided by 2 is also 3. Int is right in int, so if our n is 7.If n is 7 then clear n batu then mine will be 3 only then can I write this here look at 3 I can write this n batu yes and 7 then my n is only n then our formula becomes this For odd number of terms n ba 2 p n this will always be there Suppose if I had 7 8 9 n 9 then this would also become a pair this would give 1 and this would give 9Again 9 2 4 4 times 1 is coming, ok this will always be true but keep in mind that like in mathematics, don t write this as n 2 n as n n 2, it will be wrong because this n 2 is not 3.5 yet, it will become 3, so we will have to write it like this Sum n 2 n In this way, you will have to write plus n 2, it will give a different answer, he will give me the answer.
