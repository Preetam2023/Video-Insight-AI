o because the first time decrement got converted from one to zero and after that it got printed i.e. that zero itself got printed and the second time when printedIf the value of i is already zero then it will be printed as zero, then in this way our post decrement pre decrement post increment post increment pre increment operators work inside c and whenever we use loops, these increment decrement operators are very useful for us because mostly you will see that they are being used anywhere syntax wise, so we always have to use them which is the standard way forMostly people either use the variable a or useWe have discussed what is decrement operator, after this comes the question of loop counter can be float and even character, that is, in the for loop that we have written till now, our counter in the loop, which was a counter variable, can also be a float, it can also be our character.
