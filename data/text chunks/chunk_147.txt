nts got executed but together it did not happen, that means this one statement did not get executed. Now after this, if we want to write something in the last thank you, then it will get executed, will it be an obstacle?Yes, this statement will be executed in every case because there is neither if nor else before it, that is, whatever the condition is, it must be executed. We see the example of this too, compile and run it. Now if we enter 19, then in that case all these conditions are printed, all these statements along with the last one thank you will always be printed even if we enter less than 18.Now enter this else which is bigger than 18. It is not compulsory. Even if we remove it, suppose we just have to check whether this statement is bigger than 18 or not. If it is smaller then in that case we will not print anything. Still, our program will be successfully compiled. This time, if we enter 15, then only thank you will be printed.
