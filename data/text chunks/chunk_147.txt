Similarly what is happening here is int i 10. You will say here it is written that i is equal to 20. No if it was written here i i is 20 then it would mean if i is equal to 20 like in if then go on till i is equal to 20 ok but not i The meaning of 20 is put 20 here, then put 20, then the inside thing, we went inside the loop, everything is printed, then we come back here, put 20, okay, then after cutting the previous 20, we will put only 20, so this will keep going on again and again, our loop will never end because because there is no termination in it, that is, there is no condition to terminate, loops end only when we have some condition given here. Our loop has to run only till this point. Okay, so this will also be an infa loop. Let s move ahead. It is written here that int aa while aa 10 buckets, which is the entire body of our while loop. Our limit of while is from here to here. Look, bracket bracket. Okay, while i 10. Again an equal to is written. So let s go line by line.
