ually inside c we call these three as format. We specify in which format the output will come to us.And this print F function is actually our library function which is already served to us in C by default, so once we see the cases of these outputs, after executing them, now if we have to write edge, then we know that here we have to write percentage D, here we have to put comma and here we will write edge, save it and open our terminal, now we have got edge printed, edge is 22, here this isThe percentage sign is coming because we have not given the next line, so if we save it and give the next line. Now we have edge is 22. Now in a similar way, if instead of edge we have to print the value of pi, then we will write float pa 3.14 and here we will write percentage f and here we will write pi. Let s save it, so now we have printed edge is 3.14. So by default there are some numbers of decimals inside the float which are always to be printed, so we have printed them here.
