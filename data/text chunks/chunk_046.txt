ow, what is your homework, I will not do this thing, I will print all the odd numbers from 1 to 100. There is no change in this, there is a small change in this, the code is written here.Modus 2 to 0. Just a small change has to be made in it, which you know, I am not going to tell. Look at the last lecture. If you don t understand, then go ahead. Print the table of 19. You have to print the table of 19, that is, up to 10, basically you have to print 19 38 57 up to how much is 190. You have to print it here, either you print it in different lines or do one thing, only 19 is written, then there is a space.38 space has come, space has come, you can print it even after doing this, you will understand that there is a table of 19, but how to do it, but friend, tell me one thing how to print the table of 19.
