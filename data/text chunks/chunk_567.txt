ppose if we want such a data type in which for float inside we need four bytes of integer character.For example, four bytes are required and if we want to store characters in it, then the user will have to create such a custom data type himself, it is not already available in C. Now such data types are called user defined and our structure comes in the category of user defined data type, that is, the user can define it himself. So, like we have an integer array. What is an integer array? Suppose we have created an integer array A RR whose size we have given.Three, now what will happen in this, memory equal to one or three integers will be saved for us in the memory of the computer. Similarly, whenever we create a student, as soon as the student is created, we have memory equal to one string, memory equal to one integer and memory equal to one float is reserved. So now we have a new data type in which we can store three different values together and how to create it.
