condition is most important, for how long will our loop run if we want to print all the characters.So until the null character comes on our index, as soon as the null character comes, it means that our string which is there is finished, what will we do at the end, we will get a next line printed because here the characters which are there will be printed one after the other in the same line, after that we are getting a next line printed. Now let s call this function from the main function. First of all, we will call. For the first name, we will pass our first name in the print string, after that we will call ourFor the last name, we will pass our last name in the print string. One thing we must have noticed is that here we have passed only the character array i.e. our string. We did not pass the size of the string because the size is not required. We know that our string will end where the null character will come.
