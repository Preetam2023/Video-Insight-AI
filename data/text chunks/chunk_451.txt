ith the help of a pointer, so let s create a pointer which is pointing to the first memory location.We put the address of the location in it, after that we put a loop int aa e will go from 0 to 10 aa p plus we print every time which index s value we need, percentage d index i, we need the value of the index and we scan that value, percentage d will give the address here, pointer plus aa ka, so here we have put a for loop and this for loop is going from 08 index to our ninth index.The value will be from zero till the last 10 days. We have started from zero because indexing is zero based. According to the array, now here we will print first which index we want the value of. So i is our index in a way and whoever has to be scanned, we will write in it pointer p a i.e. the pointer is pointing to the index.
