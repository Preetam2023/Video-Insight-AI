e of the product is 1 2, so here we have our 2, then i is also our look at 1, it has become th, then see if 3 is less than 5, go ahead here, then our product is equal to the current value of the product is 2 i, the value of 3, so the value of the product has become 6, notice this has become the product, 6, then i has become p i.4 Is 4 smaller than 5? It s true. Go inside. Product is equal to current product. Value of i is 6. Value of i is my four. Okay, so 6 4. How much is ours. 24 is stored in place of product. So write here 24. Then we have i. Plus i as it gets bigger, value of i becomes the last fi. Now checked whether fi is less than fi or five. Yes, but after this the loop ends.
