while loop while while one iter r int i e as long as our i equal to n then our while loop will run. What will we do inside the while loop? We will print our value every time i.e. our i and after that we will do i . So what happened is that first of all we asked the user for the number.The while loop will run every time, we will print it and then update it by one. Let s save it and run it. So first of all we have to enter the number number. We are going to enter seven. Seven, we have entered it, so all the numbers from row to seven have been printed for us. Now here we could have also entered any big number like suppose we have entered 55 then row. We have printed all the numbers from 1 to 55, so the only way to learn For Loops or any concept in C well is to do a lot of its questions. If we are clear about the things we are practicing, then there is no problem. We can use the same code with for instead of while. How to do it here. Comment out and write the same code in for.
