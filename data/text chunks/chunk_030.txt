e had talked about what was the issue in the variable, the value of the variable could have changed. Now if whenever we create big softwares in big companies, like we created an admin panel, we created a website, what do we do for its testing purposes, we keep our own email password which isIt is fixed, the value of which we should not change. Every time we have to log in with the same email password, then what can we do. We can create an email variable inside a file, we can create a password variable and keep any value inside both of them. Those values inside C which always remain constant, those whose value does not change, we call them constants. There are three types of constants. The first of these are integer constants like our number one.The value of one is done. The value of one will always remain one. The value of one cannot be negative 1 or 0 or negative f. The value of one will always remain the same.
