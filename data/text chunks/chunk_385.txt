ter to pointer i.e. PPT R. We will store it inside PPT R. We will store the address of PTR then PTR.If we took the address of a and stored it inside P PTR, then I hope this chain will be clear to us that our pointer stores the address of the normal variable and the pointer stores the address of the variable, our pointer to pointer, so this change keeps going on. Now let s understand it a little more in the form of a question. Our question is print the value of a from its pointer to point. Here we have any one.Variable would have been given. Suppose int a i 5 y a variable has been given. Now we have been given its pointer to pointer, which means first of all we would have created a pointer to it int ptr in which we would have stored the value address of aa, after that we would have created a pointer to it p ptr in which we would have stored the address of ptr. Now we do not have both of these but we have this only with the help of this ppt r.
