hile coding. If we will definitely remember, then all the things which are there remain in the mind. The data type is what type of data you are storing inside the memory and whatever type of data is there, it is specified for it that it will consume only that much memory, like whenever we buy a pen drive, it is written on it that it is 8GB pen drive or 16GB pen drive. In the same way, our character type data eats our one byte memory.If we talk about zero type data, it eats up our 2 byte memory. If we talk about float data, then it eats up our four byte memory. Now those students who are learning C after learning other languages will be a little surprised like me because they will come to know that in C there is neither Boolean type data type nor String type data type. Both of these do not exist in C because C came first i.e. C in 1970.
