ary function that we will talk about is our string copy. What does string copy do? It is called ATR.Let s write CPY, two arguments are passed in it, the first argument is our new string, the second argument is our old string, so it copies the value of old string to the new string. Suppose we have created two strings, the first is our character SR1, inside it we have written hello and the second is our character SR2, inside this we have written world. Now this is our new string, this is our old string. If we call SR CPY, first pass our ATR one.And then pass our ATR 2, then the value of our SR and key will change to Hello, that is, the old value will be copied inside it. The value of the second string will be copied inside the first. Let s see how it runs. We will create two strings inside the code. The first will be our old string. We will store the old string in it. Then let us create our new string and store it in it. New string.
