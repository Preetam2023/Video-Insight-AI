product because it is a product and did not initialize it with zero, zero.I will always answer zero. Think about it yourself. This is your homework. I initialized it from one and here we can just do it. Off course the factorial is okay. By doing this we can remove this thing and of course we run our loop. What do we have to remove again? What do we need to remove int? It is not inline. Int a 1. Let s take n and a x p. Okay, you don t have to do anything. You just have to write this product once.Equal to product multiply by a ok let s see what we need to find out, if suppose we have 5 factorial let s say 5 factorial then its value is 1 2 3 4 5 also you can write ok it is your wish if it is ok then 1 neither 2 3 nor 4 nor 5 ok and so on so on So you must have understood what is going to happen in the loop once let s run it let s see the code I ran.Why did the error come? Friend, I have initialized the sum somewhere. Here the sum is written.
