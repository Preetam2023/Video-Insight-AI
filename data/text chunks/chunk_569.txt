we will write struct keyword struct, after that we will write student as the name of our structure. Now inside this we are going to define three things, roll number CGPA and name, first of allWe write int role after that float CGPA end after that character name of 100 characters and at the end we will put statement terminator so this is our data type defined structure is our user defined data type now inside the main function we will create a variable of structure type structure student our type and after that the name of the variable is s1 which we have not initialized yet but have just declared it as initialism and this is itsproperty Yes, now if we want to access the roll property of s1, then we will put dot operator in the middle i.e. s1 and roll number, we will make it equal to 2, then after our value we will write s1, we add some value in this also, then now we have to write s1.n If we start writing it normally like we simply wrote s1.
