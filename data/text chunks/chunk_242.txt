posite of break. Continue break says here stop all the work and move ahead. Continue says that s it.If we want to stop the current work and start the next work, then whenever we want to skip to the next iteration, whenever we want to skip to the next iteration, we write Continue, that is, all the lines of the current iteration will be deleted and will be run in the next iteration. Let us write an example of this. Things will be understood better by writing the code. For int i 1 i i le ect 5 i p plus. Now we will go from one to five.We want to print all the numbers but we hate the number three, it seems very unlucky not to print it. If we want to print all the others, then what can we write here. If first of all we write the print statement, we write the percentage of all our numbers, d b n and our number n or our number a and we check at the top. If our a is equal to two is equal to 3, then this unlucky number has come, ours.
