value of a is 0 and value of b is my 5 then I have to print the answer 2 ray to the power of 5 i.e. whatever is 32 or whatever I have given, if I have given the rate of 10 to the power of 7 then print that.If we have to do it then we have to print it like this, then how will we solve it? Again, we can solve this through loops. How should we know one thing? Whenever I say 2 to the power of 5, let s take a to the power of b, then 2 to the power of 5 is something like this. We can write it like this 2 2 2 2 2 means, the power of any can be anything. We multiply the same number as many times as I want.The exponent is ok, it is five times, so if you multiply t by itself five times, then the power of t will become 5. If you multiply t ten times, then it will become the power of 3. Do you understand that by doing this, we can solve it, so this is our simple guess that came from the loop, you will think that it can be solved.
