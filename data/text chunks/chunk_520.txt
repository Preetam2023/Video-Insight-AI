t should come to us is the length. We should have four, so the null character should not be counted. We should print the length of our user s name by adding all the other characters.If you want to get it done, let s make a program. First of all, make a string named name, after that do this F gets name 100 std in. Now make a function above. Which will count the length, we will be passing count length in it. It is not necessary that we say our character name or character array. It is not necessary that tomorrow if we have to find out the length of any sentence, then we can use this function for that also, so it is not necessary that we just calculate the length of the name or we can calculate the length of any string or the length of any character, then let s define void effect here.From this our length will be returned, so we write int as int count length character array.
