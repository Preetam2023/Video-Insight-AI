functions. You can put as many buttons as you want inside your remote, similarly in your C program.You can create as many functions as you want inside it, provided that you create the functions logically. We are not writing extra code to create more functions. Now there are two types of functions, the first type is our library functions and the second is Our user defined functions are library functions which are special functions which are inbuilt in C, meaning there are different libraries inside C in which some functions are already present. The names of those functions are keywords. For us, we cannot create any function of our own again in the name of their functions. Their functions are also already fixed and others are our user defined functions which are declared by us, the programmer and we.If we define it, then the coders are declaring it. The coders are defining it. The coders are using it. If we talk about library functions, then already we are using the library functions.
