l be stored inside this Fina. Now we know that Fina of one row is row and Fina of one is always one. Whenever we enter this n, we will keep in mind the value of n. If the value of n is greater than one or greater than two then Fina row is zero, Fina and one is one.This is always true, we have to always write it down, so we have written them down. Now we have to calculate further FINA, so let s put a loop for that. What we did last time was to calculate FINA from recurt. This time we are doing it with a loop and it is even easier to do it with a loop. How will we run the loop from two and take it till n, so that s done for row and one, now we will start calculating FINA for two and calculate till n 1.
