ue of five, then print six.Look, then seven will be printed. 9, 10, finally, 11 will not be printed. Okay, but this will be a very subjective question, so we will directly write the garbage value will come. I am fine, usually no answer will come. Let s move ahead, friend. Got to learn a good concept. Predict the output main int aa key value given one. Created a box named aa. Inside that we gave one value. Okay till aa comes my 10.Is it smaller than 10 or is it smaller than 10? Keep printing the value of a by giving a back slash and come on. So it s very straight forward man, there is a question if I go to the output. Okay, this is a very straight forward question. What is the value of i and is it smaller than 10. Just print it out. Back slash N. First of all give an enter already. Nothing will be printed on the first line. Enter and we will print our i.
