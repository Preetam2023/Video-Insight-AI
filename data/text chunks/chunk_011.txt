hich has been created for us. If we try to print the name of p1 here, then now we will get no error. Why is it coming because here we have used double underscore?If we run it, we will get an error here, so what is this thing? This thing has become conceptually private in a way. Similarly, we can also make the methods private. For example, if I define a method called Hello, which prints what, which prints, Hello user prints something in this way or Hello person prints something in this way, so now like a normal method, it is here.It is not possible to make a call, meaning if we think that we will write hello here in this way, then this thing is not possible in Python, what will happen inside it? Inside also we will get the error that Person object has no attribute called hello because here we have used underscore underscore.
