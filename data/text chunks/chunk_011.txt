of valid breadth for search next we will see depth for search now next is depth for search for this I will take a stack stack is a data structure used here let us start I can start the traversal from any vertex I like so I want to start from vertex one so one is visited this is the initial step now the repeating step what I have to do every time as this new Vortex is visited start exploring it so who are adjacent to that four and two so visit 4 4 4 now the rule in bre depth for searches what once you have visited one vertex still one more is remaining leave that we will see it afterwards first you start exploring four so this is the rule so once you have reached a new vertex start exploring that new vtex what about that one suspend it and keep it in the step that we can explore it later now start exploring four so from four I can go on three so okay go to three three is visited now what to do suspend four and start exploring three from three I can go on 10 so 10 suspend three start ex
