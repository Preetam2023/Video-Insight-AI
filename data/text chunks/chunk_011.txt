e this print F only once, there was no need to write it seven times, so this block is useful for us. It is useful for doing one thing multiple times. Okay, now in this There are different parts, it might seem a bit strange code to you, like I write int i 1 semicalculus, oh man, these things used to be like this, like I write int x 5 semicalculus, so this is a normal statement in which we created a box, created a variable namedFriend, it is doing the same thing, then after the semi calculation, something else is written i e le e 7, another semi calculation is applied and then I have written i p plus here, so what is the meaning of this, before that, if I write i i 1 instead of i p, its meaning is the same. Look, if I run it seven times, it is okay. If I write six instead of seven, it is printed six times, okay.
