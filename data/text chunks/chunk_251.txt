, so there are different ways to do it, that is in your competitive programming or extreme DSA side.Same goes when you are storing factorial in a string, but in C, there are no strings, so your character array will be used. What are all these things, we will be studying in details in the upcoming chapters. For now, those coming from other languages will be understanding it better. Its basic is that when we run this program, we will not give big numbers but will calculate the factorial of small numbers to calculate factorial, then that will be our program.Now let s save this code here and let s run it. First of all let s calculate the factorial of three. The final factorial is six which is correct. Now if we want to run the factorial of 5 is 120, this is also correct. If we calculate the factorial of 6 then that is 720.
