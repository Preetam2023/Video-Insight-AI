ot only with two, because our code is absolutely correct here, only we have not seen two in general.Do you remember all the Esc values? What are the values of capital A? 65 SmallEquivalent characters of 26 alphabets using a while loop, basically what we have to print, I will tell you here, I have to print this, let s remove it back and first of all we write in the alphabets, whatever is small case or capital case is fine because alphabets also have two of us, so we will talk about the capital case now, then later we will do both, basically what we have to show by printing, we have to show it by printing like this.Okay, we have to write A 65, then in the next line it is written B 66, then C 67, then D 68 up to whatever our root is 90, this value will come.
