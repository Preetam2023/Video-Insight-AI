w actually at is coming, see, 1 2 3 4 5 6, six term is coming at, so all the work is done like this.Do you understand what I have done in the code, see whatever I am getting n, I have to run the loop twice less than that so that I get that number because the loop is actually being run from here, look, the value of a was one, the value of b was one, then look here, I ran the loop, here it is written, loop, then the value of the sum became a b, that is, the value of the sum became two, okay, then look at our a, the value of b also became one in a.Here comes two in B. Just notice the sum. Then in the next iteration, the value of sum will be three. Then in the next iteration, five, in the next, 8, in the next, 13, in the next, 21. Okay, so actually, when in the code, I just give six, six times when the loop runs, then directly the answer comes to 21. But I have to show that that is the eighth final number. So I will do two first. Just write the number here n 2. Okay.
