even, then here we will stop or break, till then we will keep taking input of numbers from the user.Now whenever we have to take some input from the user and run a condition for it, we always prefer do while loop, why do loop because right now what is our job is to take input from the user, we will take the input of the number only once, then we will be able to check it by putting some condition beyond that, that s why first do the work and then apply the condition, so here we try to build the logic a little bit of do while, rest you can do it in some way.We can also do this same question inside the loop. First of all, what we will do is create a do while loop, then we will write do and later we will write while. Now what we have to do inside this do while loop is to take the input of a number again and again. So above we define a variable int n. This is our number and every time inside our do loop, we will take the number from scanf inside the do loop. So in this way, every time.
