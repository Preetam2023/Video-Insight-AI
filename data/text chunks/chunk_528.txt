e will store the old string in it. Then let us create our new string and store it in it. New string. Now call STTR CPY in which we will first pass our new string andThen the old string and now we will print the value of the new string, we save it and run, so as soon as we got the new string printed, we have the old string printed, the new string is not printed because what the string copy did is that we took the value of the old string and copied it into the new string, then the value of the new string got changed ultimately and now we have that changed value printed, so this is how our string copy works, the next library function which we will talk about.That is String Concatenate here. By the way, we are talking about all the important library functions, so we will discuss only four. However, there are many library functions inside the string D, so the homework for you will be to go and explore all the other library functions on your own.
