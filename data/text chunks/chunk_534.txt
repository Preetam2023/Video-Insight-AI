increasing. So in Banana, which is an S value, first of all, the value of b will be compared with a. If both of them were HH, then the value of both would have been the same, then the next character would have been compared, but that is not the case, here only the first character is different.So the value of b will be something in numbers. The value of a will be something in numbers. If we calculate the difference between these two, then the Esc character of b is bigger, that of A is smaller, then Esc characters will be minus, like if we look at one character of b, character b b, then the character of b is 66, so here 66 will come, so a should be 65, so what is happening internally, it will be 66 65, which meansDifference will come 1, that is why a positive value will be printed, that is, we will subtract the Esc of the second string from the Esc of the first string.
