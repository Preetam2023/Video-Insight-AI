First of all the argument will go inside the file pointer, after that our character will go inside the character.

Now there is L inside the D .The text was the complete data, we replace it whenever we write, but this time if we want to append, that is, if we open this file in append mode, then what is the mango? Now let s see what is the output. After this, another mango has been added. Now in this case, when we appended, our old data is not erased. We have added some additional things to that data. Next let s talk about what if we read a file only character by character.
