ide the sum like the value of i is one in the beginning.After updating, we have the value of to sum. Now what will happen inside the one loop is sum i equal to sum i i.e. 1 2 i.e. 3. Now the value of i will become th. The value of sum will become th. What will happen inside the loop is sum sum i 1 2 3 6. So our process will be something like this. Once we write the code, we will discuss it again. What will we do in the beginning? First of all, we ask for a number from the user.Enter number, create a variable int n, store it inside n, then scan if percentage d and n. After that, create another variable. Sum will initialize the value of sum with zero and create one. In the for loop, we will write i 0 or i 1 i until our equation n remains i p and inside this loop, we will add sum to sum as sum i or we can write this as sum e.
