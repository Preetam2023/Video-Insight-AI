eady, we ask this question.Done, let s talk next about Reloc Reloc means reallocation of memory i.e. re allocating a memory, like we just saw in the example that there were 30 children in your class, the roll numbers of 30 children. You have reserved the memory for storing which is equal to 30 malla by size of int. Now three more new children come in your class. Three more new children come, then you will have to add extra whatever is the size of three more new children. Inside that memory, you can add some more memory in the same chunk of memory, due to which what will happen is that while using the same pointer, you will also keep adding extra information inside your code, so relocate it i.e.You can also increase the memory. You can also decrease the memory. You can also increase the memory by using the same pointer and size. You can also decrease the memory.
