the library function here, there is a library, Method A, inside which are all the functions of math. There is a function inside this library, whose name is Power, we have already discussed a little about it, now the name of the power function is PO, inside whichFirst of all, we enter our number i.e. whatever number we want to take the power of, after that we enter the power, then we enter two, what will it return, will it return the number to the power 2. Here, if we enter pow n4, what will it return to us, power of n is 4, because we have to take a square, then we will be entering the number and two, so let s use it. Once above, first of all, we will include our library. If we do not include it, then we will not be able to use the function, hence above.We will have to include this method A. After that, what will we do? Let s comment it out in our main function. Take a number int n. We keep the value of int n as four. Now we print the percentage d. Here we will write power.
