fferent people. Now it makes us visualize each block. This is a plot on which we have built a house. We have named the house as Edge and the number living inside the house is22 and here is the address of that house 20110 Now in this house yesterday we could remove 22 and keep 21 or by removing 22 we can keep 20, anyone can live in the house i.e. any data can be stored inside any memory location and its name can also be changed. Now, the name of Shahrukh Khan s house is Mannat, the name of Ambani s house is something else, so here we can remove the edge and keep the name of any variable, but the plot above the Earth, which is the land, if there is a farm somewhere, then it will remain there, that land will remain there, that is why this memory block will remain there and its address is always fixed. When our mother comes to the computer, it is already fixed on it.
