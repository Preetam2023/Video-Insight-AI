we will reallocate it. If we keep 70 keys, then this difference will be completely cleared for free. In reallocate, we will remove as much unnecessary memory as we have to remove and we will keep as much as we need, so the syntax of writing it is this.First we write reloc, then we put the pointer whose memory is to be reallocated and after that the new size, what is going to be the new size of the memory and from that we will assign it back to our pointer. So the question in this is Allocate memory for five numbers then dynamically increase it to store at numbers. How will we write the code for this? First of all we will create an integer pointer PTR. Now what is PTR doing? Initially it stores the memory equal to five numbers.In fact, let s use only Calc because I like initialization, so inside Calc we have to store memory equal to the number five, so the second size of Vint, now we have written PTR of 0, we have written one PTR of 1, we have written 2 and PTR of 3, we have written t.
