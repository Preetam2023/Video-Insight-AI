d all the parameters. Or let s run it once and see that after running it we have the correct output. So, if you are creating a structure and you want its name to be Man, now I will have to write Computer Engineering in full. In this case, a new programmer comes, here I cannot just write COE, because COE would be understandable to children, teachers would understand it, but a new coder would not understand it, then there you yes, write the full name while defining the structure, but whenever it is used in other places in the code,If you have to do this then what is the point of writing it again and again, then give a small nickname to your structure there. We can do the same thing for different integers, we can do it for floats as well, we can do it for characters too, but we do not do it because they already have very short names, so there is not much point in giving them aliases in mostly cases, that is why whenever we use type def, mostly in the cases of structures, we use it.
