wing here that student object has no eligible name. So in this way we can use our dl delete keyword.Next we are going to talk about private variables in general whenever we read oops , like in any language, whenever we read oops in c p, in Java, we have this concept of public and private. Generally, in other languages, if we make any variable or any method public, then it generally means that we call that method or that attribute as a class.Can also be accessed from outside like till now if I have created a student then in student I can write s1.n What am I doing from the scope of my class, that is, this is the scope of the class, wherever there are things inside the class, I can access the student s name outside the class, so we generally put it in the public category, but sometimes we have some such sensitive information, some are sensitive edible, there are some methods which we want to keep private, which we do not want to give access to anyone outside our class.

and then divides them into small chunks and converts them into vector representations or embeddings. Then these vector embeddings are stored in a specialized vector database so that when the time comes according to the user s query.Here, when a user gives a query, it is also converted into a vector embedding, then that query embedding is compared with the vector database and the top relevant chunks are retrieved so that these retrieved chunks can be merged with the original query to form an augmented context. After this, this augmented context is fed into an LLM model such as GPT.4 or Clot 3 is then fed to the final output of the generated response model which provides relevant and information rich answers to the user s queries. Ruck can be used in conjunction with LLM or independently. When used with LLM, responses are more fluent. Context rich because it provides LLM with relevant and up to date information from external sources.
