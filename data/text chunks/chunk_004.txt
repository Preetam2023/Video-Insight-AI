wing here that student object has no eligible name. So in this way we can use our dl delete keyword.Next we are going to talk about private variables in general whenever we read oops , like in any language, whenever we read oops in c p, in Java, we have this concept of public and private. Generally, in other languages, if we make any variable or any method public, then it generally means that we call that method or that attribute as a class.Can also be accessed from outside like till now if I have created a student then in student I can write s1.n What am I doing from the scope of my class, that is, this is the scope of the class, wherever there are things inside the class, I can access the student s name outside the class, so we generally put it in the public category, but sometimes we have some such sensitive information, some are sensitive edible, there are some methods which we want to keep private, which we do not want to give access to anyone outside our class.
