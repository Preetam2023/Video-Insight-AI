to take edge parameters inside our function.If they are matching then from here we call Sum a and b. Here we create a variable named s, so what is happening here is that we called Sum in which we first passed a and then passed b. What will this a do? We will send its value here. Whatever our user enters inside a, we will send it to a and it will be copied to this a inside the definition here, so the values are copied. If the value of b is passed from here, then the value of b will be sent to this b.This will be copied inside . We could have also written x and y, so here for simplicity, if we write it asLet s save the percentage d once and run the code. There is a little complexity, so there is no need to take any tension. We will see a lot of examples and a lot of explanations and many properties that the concept of the function will seem very simple and will settle in the mind very well. First of all, let s enter our first number. Now we have to understand it logically.
