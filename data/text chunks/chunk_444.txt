e let s print their values too, percentage u, percentage u and here we will print PTR and under PTR. So first of all is the value of PTR.18700 which is ending under 264, the value of PTR is ending under 260, so when we did PTR PTR underscore PTR, then it is 260 minus from 264, then the difference should be of four but one is printed because it will not show four, it will not show the meaning in bytes, it will show the difference of how many integers there is between the two, so there is a difference of one integer.Which is equivalent to four bytes and it had to return true in the comparison because both are pointing to the same address, so obviously the value of both is the same. Now let s do a small thing and together here let s make the pay edge a character and make it a character pointer. Now this is a character pointer. In the comparison, obviously both will not return true. But analyze the difference once.
