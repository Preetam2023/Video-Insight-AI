example, associativity says to do left to right i.e. keep performing operations from left to right. If it is of same presidency then like here multiply divide and this one is multiply of same presidency then what will we do.We will calculate from left to right. If we calculate from left to right, then first of all we will calculate 4 3. 4 3 will become our 12. Then we will calculate 12 6 this will become our 3. Then we will calculate 2 2 this will become our 1. So first of all we multiplied four by three, then we divided its output with six, then we multiplied its output with two, so in this way.We went on from left to right. If I have to show it in bracket form, what can I write? I can write, first multiply four by three, then divide it and then multiply it by two and assign the final value toFor this value, the output we will get is four because here the associativity rule is applied. Our calculations are done from left to right.
