in it, we are okay, if we run then enter the number, then I say 25, okay, then see what is written.Here comes our number is positive or the given number is positive, let s write the given number is positive. Once we run it back here, write 25 the given number is composite. So it is ok but still we could not find out anything for the prime number. How does it mean? Look, if I run the Dalu code here, I write here 23 23 is a prime number, then look, the code is finished, nothing came, so what do we do for the prime.Because we will not be able to write anything, for that you understand what I am trying to say, I cannot say that if n modus a is not equal to zero. Look, suppose if I write else, that means if my number is not divisible, then here I will not write this. Look, print F, it will get messed up, otherwise if I write this, then it will be very wrong because see, if I run and do this here.
