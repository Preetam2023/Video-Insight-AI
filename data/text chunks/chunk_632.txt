ent storage. If we are able to store that data in some way or the other, then for that we use files. Just like suppose you had created a program, we have just told you in the structure section thatThe data of school or college students is to be input into your program. Now as soon as your program ends, that data will be lost. Next time to get your data back, you will have to run the program again and ask the user again. But if you want to ask the user only once to store it somewhere, then where will we store it? We will be storing it permanently inside our computer system in the things called files. Now first of all let us talk about what operations we can do on the files.We can imagine the file in the same way as we have files in real life, just like the file is inside our computer system, the first operation is that we can create the file, secondly we can open the file, we can close it. To read the data of any file, we have to first open it and after reading it, we have to close it.
