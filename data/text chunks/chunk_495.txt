Now one more thing to notice here is that whenever you write the character, there are single codes.But we use double codes to write the string, so this distinction should always be remembered if Yes, if we write single quotes then we will be getting error because this method is wrong. Now in this way also we have to create our string as initialism variable. If we want to create the same string then we will create it like this. So we have got a string whose name is name and inside which is stored our actual value and inside it we do not need to enter the zero which is 0, our compiler will automatically put it for us. See another example of this.
