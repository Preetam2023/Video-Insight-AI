to a. E b means that here we are asking the question that the value of a is equal to the value of b.What and a b means that we are putting the value of b in a, so whenever we talk about relational operators, when we talk about checking the relation, then we will be using it i.e. if we want to write double equal to in our code. Let s get Tput done, here we will write a is equal to equal to or a is not defined then 4 is equal to equal to 4. If we write this and save it and run it then we will have one in the output. What does this one show? One says the statement is true i.e. 4 e is returning 4 as true i.e. it is saying correct on the C compiler. If here te 4 3 then in this case we do not have one.In this case, it would be printed, Ro i.e. 4 is returning 3 false is false, then C is a special language in which there are no true false. Instead of true false, we have one, and instead of false, we have ro.
