over, I came to know about composite, it is fine here but for prime I know what one thing I can do.Instead of like, what I said is that if my number is being divided, if look, if a modus is equal to 0, here I was printing that the number is composite. Instead of printing, I can do one thing, first of all, I can declare a number, I can create a box from Let s say a variable named int a and inside a, I store zero, okay, I store it here.Zero, if my number is divisible, what can I do instead of printing. If the condition hits, if the number is divisible, then I will store the one inside a. Okay, and then I will apply the break. If I brake, then the loop ends and as soon as the loop ends, now I will check again whether a is my zero. It still means that if it has not changed, then the number is my prime, otherwise my number is composite. I will print it like this. Once I code it, I will show you a little more clarity.
