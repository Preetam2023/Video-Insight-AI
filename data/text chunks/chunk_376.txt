er, then which value is printed and if we put asteris in front of m percent edge, that means take out the address and then put ast risk, then which one?The value is printed. The next thing we will be talking about is a practice question which will make things more clear. In this question we have to find out the output. Our question is something like this, first of all, what we have done is that we have created a pointer with the name ptr and have created an integer x. Now inside the pointer, we have put the address ofA variable x, now the address ofWe have stored zero inside 2000. Here something like this has happened, this line of ours is very important which we need to pay attention to. What is happening in this line, whatever address is there inside PTR, we will go to that address and store zero there. If there is 2000 inside PTR, then we will go to 2000 and store zero there, so this is the way we have done the work here.
