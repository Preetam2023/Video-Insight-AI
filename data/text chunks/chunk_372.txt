when we got the address edge printed then the value printed and when we got the PTR printed PTR i.e. the value of this variable, then both of them are the same because whatever address of the edge was now ultimately stored inside the PTR, hence both the values are the same and after this if we want to print the value of our PTR.What will we write for the address on M i.e. the address of PTR, let s save it too. Now let s run it. These are the first and second values, both of them are the same because both EDGE and PTR hold the same value, but whenever you print the address of PTR, this value is different. You will notice that the last two digits are different, they are the same, so both of them have the same address.value and its address value That is, the address of PTR is different, so in this way we get our address printed. Next let s talk about how to print the value of the address stored on the pointer, in this we will be learning about the value at address operator.
