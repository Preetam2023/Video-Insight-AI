ow why does this happen, you don t have to pay attention to this thing, it s okay, this permutation.The concept of combination is that if we do not select anything then there is a way but anyway it is ok 0 factorial is our one just remember it S True like if I say power of a is 0 and 0 is factorial one 1 factorial is also my one 2 factorial you can take out 2 1 2 is 3 pho is 3 2 1 i.e. 6 and so on like thisMeaning, basically any factorial can be generated. We have to tell a program that I give the input number n and I get the answer. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 4 3 2 1, so 5 4 20 20 3 60 2 120, so 120 should give me the answer of the computer. So how will we write its code, it is very simple, by the way, you can get aPause the video a few times and think for yourself. I hope you have thought about it. Now here, friend, I write the algorithm here and build it into it. You don t have to do anything, you just have to declare a variable.
