ave to do coding there, then such mistakes are very basic mistakes which you should not make at all.Talking about loops, always keep in mind that you have created a loop inside your program, so this is our loop, that is our while loop. Now the syntax of writing the while loop is a little easier. In the beginning, we have done the code with the least difficult syntax, for loop. Now all the loops will seem easy to us, the rest of the things will seem very easy, but if you still have a little doubt in the for loop, then rewind it a little and see the questions which we discussed.If you have any doubts in them, then look at them a little, otherwise, look at the notes and understand it very well. Now let s read the while loops. The syntax of while is that first of all we write our keyword while and inside it we write our condition and then inside we write those statements which will do some work for us.
