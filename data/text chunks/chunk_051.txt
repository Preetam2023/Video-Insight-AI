last term, which I call the eighth term, okay, from here you should know a little bit of 10th maths.If you don t know then friend, go to the Physics Foundation channel, there they have taught Ariam Progression in 10th. It will be useful only to that extent, not much, right, so you should know how to find the formula of n term here. What happens is that in odd numbers, it is 2n 1, so its eighth term will be our dot dot 2n 1 and why does it happen, see this if you have any A.P.D.A.P.D.P.D.A.P.D.P.D P D 3D is the last term, my A is my A, this is my friend, your element is right, where A is our first term, right is the first term, like here the first term is our N and D is our friend, what is the common difference?Our term is a n 1d. We can rival this very easily. What is our first term here? Suppose, if we did not know then what would be the first term.Our 2n 1 is now formed, so this is the last term. Now, what is our 10th term? Well, we can directly calculate it from the formula here.
