of a number B and we will output the sum of these two, that is, we are going to write a small code. For this code, first of all,After creating the numbers, we create int a and b, now first print f, enter a, after that we will scan a, d and a, after that we will print f, enter b, then take it from scanf, input end b, now we will store the sum of these two in a third variable i.e. int sum e e a b, so here too, plus minus multiply divide. Reminder, all these work like math, so there is a plus sign for plus and for minus.There is a minus sign and what does it equal to two? It will calculate the value of both of them and put it inside the sum. It is equal to two which is this. Assignment operator is called plus, we use it as an addition operator. We will discuss about these operators in different ways, whatever they are inside C. Later, we will be discussing in details. So this sum which has come to us, now we will print it. Print F to sum is percentage d. Sum. Let s save this code.
