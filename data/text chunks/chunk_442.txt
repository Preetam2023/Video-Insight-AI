se questions. Just add the size. If 1 is written in the integer then it does not mean 1, it means 4.If it is written in float then it also means 4. If it is written in character then it means 1. Now there are two more things inside the pointer or matrix, the first of which is that we can denote one pointer from Other means from one pointer we can subtract the value of the other pointer like if we have written int ptr and is pointing to some integer edge and int ptr2 is pointing to some integer edge two then if we do pt2 pt1 then this is the operation which is lid. Along with this we can also compare two points i.e. the value of one pointer with the other pointer.You can compare it with the value, the answer will be either true or false. Let s see an example of this. Int A E 22 Int A E 23 So this is the underscore edge which is a separate variable. We make points according to this Int Star PTR.
