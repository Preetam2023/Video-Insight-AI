ge the fourth with the fourth last, then the first one will go back, the last one will come forward. Now how to do this in the code, now we know that first of all we have to run a loop so that we can go to each element, then we will put a loop, what will that loop do?If we take the example of our array again, it will start from row 1 2 3 4 5 6. If we take the example of this array, then the loop will start from row and how far will the loop go, the loop will go till the half of the array, that is, if it will go till here, then we will exchange this element with this.So the loop will go to half of our size less then n will be divided by 2i and what will happen inside the loop. The values of the array will be exchanged inside the loop. So first of all, what will be the first value? The first value will be the value of our array of i i.e. whatever value is on the rectangle index is our first value and the second value which has to be exchanged is how to find the second value.
