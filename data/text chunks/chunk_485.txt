the values in this manner. Let s write the code for this. First of all create an array named tables.Let s take number 10, now let s create a function to store the tables. We will pass the void store table inside it. We will pass D array and its size. First of all A and then A. So here two loops are placed. The first one to put two loops is for int a i 0 a less a a a plus plus.You write A here because A is our row and A is our column. Whatever column we are talking about, the array of n is equal to the number whose table we have to store. The number will be multiplied by a pv, here we add the int number in the declaration, now we will call the store tables inside the main function, inside which we will pass first our array, 2d array, after that we will pass the number of rows, for which row do we want to print it, first of all, zero is for the row and the column in it is 10 and the number is which table is to be printed, let us copy this and again what to do in the first row.
