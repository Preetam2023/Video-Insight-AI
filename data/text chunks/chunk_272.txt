the good bye we are printing good bye. We have mentioned the prototype of both the functions above. After that, just like we were calling hello, we can also call print good bye.Here we will write print goodbye and save it and run, so first of all we called hello, then hello was printed, then we called goodbye, then goodbye was printed. The function which is called first is executed first, then later we will call the function which will be executed later, that is, how will our method of execution be? First of all, we will always start with the main function. We have come to the main function of the code.
