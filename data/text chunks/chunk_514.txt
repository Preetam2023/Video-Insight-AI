ters are input and the new line is edited, that is, you will keep writing your entire word as it is. You will keep writing different words as soon as you press enter or as soon as your n 1 is one less than the size given here. If you enter letters, then your sentence there, your string will end, let us see an example of this here too.Instead of Gets, we do Na F Gets, write ATR, then in ATR we will write 100 and after that we will write STD and save it and run. This time again enter our complete word, it has come back. Now what does this put S do? Push automatically gives a next line. After printing, you have printed whatever you had to print. Now your cursor has come to the next line and since then press return.Once this is done, our programming is over here, so whenever we are putting put ast, we do not need to do back slash and because the next line will come automatically, so in this way our get s, put s and f gates work. The next thing we will learn is a very learned thing.
