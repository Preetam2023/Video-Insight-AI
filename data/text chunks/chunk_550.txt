D part will be returned to us from inside it because it starts from n 3 index and ends at m 6 index.So the work of slice is to slice this string from here. Slice i.e. cut the first slice that comes. The first cut will be made at n 3, the second cut will be made at m 6 and the middle part will be returned to us. So let s create a function for this too. Let s name the function. What will this function do? Will it return to us? Will it get its slice? RT, so let s name it Void Slice. Inside this we will pass our character. We will also define this function. Void Slice will pass character SR in it. Along with this, there will also be an index n and an index m, so let s write them as int n int m. Now let s create a new string inside the slice function, carry new a. Well, we know the size of this string as m n 1, but by default we keep its size as 100. Now let s run a loop.
