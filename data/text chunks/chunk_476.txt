will become two. Now we will see that the value of i which is two is less than our 5 2 5 2 integer.If there is 2 then 2 2, whatever is there will be false, so the loop will end here, we will not be able to reach three, so three will remain the same and if we look at the final array, what will come in the final array? First five, then four, then three, then two, then one. This is our reverse. Now let s write the code for this in the code. We have already created an array T 3 4 5. Now what will we do simply, let s create a new function int reverse, inside which we will have one.We will take the array and take the size int reverse int array and the size of the array n Now let s run a loop int aa i will loop from 0 to aa lesson n batu and aa pps and every time what we will do is first of all we will take out the first value first value was array of s and our second value was array of n i 1 it will not be zero it will be array of i Now put in the array of i our second value and array of n
