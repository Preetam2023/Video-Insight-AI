n, then after that first string.The value of the string will change and become equal to Hello World. So in a way, what happened is that String Concatenate took the second string and added it after the first string, then the value of the first string will be equal to this. Now one special thing we need to keep in mind here is that the capacity of the first string should be the To store both the strings, that is, if the size of the first string is equal to the length of the first string, one plus the length of two or is greater than this, then only we will be able to store the value within it, otherwise an error will occur. So, whenever we declare this string as the first string, we will have to increase its size. Once we actually write it in the code, let s comment it out. First of all, let s create a character string, the first string, whose size we give 100.
