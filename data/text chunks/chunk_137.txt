ies like TCS, then they can also ask you initially, otherwiseSuch questions come in your MCQ rounds. If we have to check whether a number is a two digit number, then we have seen its condition. Apart from this, in the next chapters we will be discovering many more such logical questions and solving them in very simple ways. After this, we will be given a homework problem which is a homework sheet, we will have to pause it and solve it on our own if we are not able to solve it.If an error occurs, we will find solutions in our notes. We can go through those problems and practice asking questions to ourselves. So here our chapter two ends and we move towards the next chapter which is Conditional Operators. Hi everyone and now we are going to start with our third chapter which is named Conditional Statements.
