se next time I will add some things like here when my r was four, then I will not add three to four.If I add three to 40, then every time I will have to multiply by 10 so that that place comes on the units digit and in the last I will divide n by n. This code most probably has a very small mistake in it. We will see that small mistake, okay here we write the reverse number is r, okay, I have not done anything, in this new r I am storing not my reverse number and in the last I am printing it.Okay, I will make the original number my zero at the end, so let s run it, see some error is coming, undeclared identification output, the reverse number is 43210, why is it like this, no one, let s run it one more time, we write enter number 999, what do you say, so the number should come 6999, so if we press enter, then it is 6999 0, then why is one zero extra unnecessarily, man, amazing.
