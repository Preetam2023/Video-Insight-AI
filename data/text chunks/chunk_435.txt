Here we are talking about pointers because arrays are related to pointers in some way or the other.After we understand, we will understand how they are related, then we cannot do all these multiply, divide, module within the points, but there are some arithmetic operations which we can perform, these include our increment operator and decrement operator, that is, we can plus or minus the value of the pointer, like first of all, if we look at the case, in this we have created an integer variable edge inside which we have stored 22. Suppose this edge variable is something in our memory.In this way, where 22 is stored and this is 2000, here the memory location is now what we are doing is we are creating a pointer which points to the edge, so this pointer must be created somewhere, that means there will be another location created in the memory whose name will be pointer where we have stored 2000 and it will also have its own location 4010.
