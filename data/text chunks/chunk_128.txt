e not divided with two, that is, their module does not come to us as zero, they are our odd numbers. So, whenever we have to check whether a number is even or odd, then check division by two for that too, so this is our next practice.Question in which write a program to check if a number is odd or even. Whenever we have an even case, we are going to print one in it. If there is an odd case, we are going to print zero in it. So, we have entered the number and stored it inOne is printed in 16, that is, 16 is our even number because it is divided by two. Now if we talk about seven, then in the case of seven, zero is printed because seven is our odd number. The next question says Are the following valid and not? The first statement is int e 8 and this one is the symbol 8. Now here we have already talked about our expectation, we are expecting 8 two.The power 8, which should be a big value, will not be printed here, rather it will be printed as zero.
