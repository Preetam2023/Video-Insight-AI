are total 11 numbers. Here is a small confusion which happens to the students in the initial stages. They think that from zero to 10 we have 10 numbers but actually it is not so, we have 11 numbers.From zero to 10, now we will write its code. For the code, first of all, let s create our item meter. It is our item meter. Now we will start the value from zero. We have made it equal to zero. Now here we will put the condition that the value of i is equal to our value of 10, that is, whenever i is less than 10 or equal to 10.Till then let our loop run and for update we will write i i 1, every time it has to be increased by one and here we will get the percentage d i printed, put it here in the next line, save it and run it and here we have our output in which all our values from row till 10 have been printed, so in this way we have total 11 numbers printed. Now this i i 1 is right.There is a short hand to write it i.e.
