00. Okay, if A is my Haj, then what is happening if A is 1000, then my loop will take Haj iteration. See if n is 1000 then let s say that is our for loop or whatever the loop is, the loop will run 1000 times meaning 1000.There will be 1000 rounds of iterations, this is a very big number, so it will take a lot of time, for computers it can be done quickly but it will take time, if I tell you it has a simple formula like when we were doing 1 2 3 4 up to n through for loop, then was it not needed, why because 1 2 3, see here what is its direct answer, 1 2 up toThe answer of n is n n 1 up 2. We have read these things in AP sum and 10th class maths, so why not do one thing. We also make a formula like 1 2 3 4 5 6. We can make it a formula very easily. The answer will come in two different cases. How, let s see this thing, okay, let s see here, let s assume thatWhat are our two cases? Either our n will be even or our n will be odd. Well, if n is even then our n is even.
