test in your semester exam. By using do while, you should not know the thing about ternary operator.If something is done ok then what is our first question? Above the while loop we make many predict the output questions. The first question is main int j ok box is created j name is ok while j e lesson equal to 10 print f here pay back sl a percentage d j j e equal j p 1 oh re re re so here friend you are not giving any value to j and it is asking us to keep printing as long as j is less than 10 and also make j equal to j pw then what happens in this case whenI don t have any value of J given and then the comparison is happening like if J is lesson 10, then inside J, the garbage value of type C comes. Okay, what is the garbage value? Once I run this code, I will show you and explain what is the problem with this code. It is okay, it is an error.
