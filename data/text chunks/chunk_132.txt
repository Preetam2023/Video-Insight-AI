n it takes up so much space inside the memory which is bigger than the space given to the character. So should we put it in a bigger container? Then it thinks that it will not fit in the small container with the character. Should I put it in a big container but it automatically implies that.Can t do it because it doesn t automatically put the character in an integer, that s why this warning is generated here, so we don t have to do this whenever we are defining a character. We have to define a single value character. We will call this statement invalid because here the compiler is throwing us a warning. In the next practice question, we have to tell whether to print true or false for the following statement first.The statement is If it is Sunday and it is snowing then print true i.e. if it is Sunday and it is snowing then print true. How to convert it into program form? First of all, we take two variables. The first variable is int is Sunday. The second variable is int is snowing.
