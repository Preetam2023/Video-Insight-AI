So to print the value, first of all we will write print F Percentage D because every time we are going to print the value, every time our percentage will be type D. First of all we print the edge. Back sl a control s. When we printed the edge, we got 22 printed normally. But what are we going to do now? Now we will store the value of the address which is on the pointer. Infact thisLet s do Control C, Control and End Control. Here we will write Value at Address PTR and here we will write Value at Address Address ofWe are paying a plot, that is why every time we are printing the value of the people living in the same plot, that is, we are getting 22 printed, so I hope that this syntax will also be clear to us that ast risk ptr means pointer value, address, if we put it in front of the pointer, then which value is printed and if we put asteris in front of m percent edge, that means take ou
