e a float, then we will name it in square brackets and inside we will write what should be the size. How many floats have to be stored. So as soon as we write this statement, int marks is three, then a memory location with the name of marks comes inside our memory where these one 2 3 three blocks are reserved for us and the size of these three blocks is equal to one integer. We had read the data types.That takes four bytes inside the memory, so the size of each block here is equal to four bytes, this is also four bytes, this is also four bytes and This location is also four bytes, so we get three blocks of four bytes each. Now we have by convention, we call this first block zero th block, the first block is called one, the second block is called one and the third block is called two. This is by convention. This is called zero based indexing. There are some languages in which there is one based indexing, but C P, Java are such languages in which zero based indexing is zero based.
