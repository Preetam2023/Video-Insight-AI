ue is 6. It is returned here, 6 4, that is, 10, so these are the 10 values here.Here it is 10 5 i.e. 15, so this value is returned from here and back to our main function, we have the answer 15, so at every level, whatever work we have, we keep giving it to the next level, but somewhere, that work will have to be actually written and we have done the work of actually writing. Here in our base case, what will the base case do, it will stop the recursion, plus we are believing that the next level will give us some work.The next level will give us some work but that actual work will have to be done somewhere, at some level or the other, that work is done on our base case, at our last level, so these n times are our levels which are called, this was the first level, this was the second level, this was the third level, this was the fourth level, this was the fifth level. In the language of programming, this is called Recurse Tree. We need to go into so much detail.
