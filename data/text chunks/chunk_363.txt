we will pick up that 22 value and put it in the new underscore range. Let s do a little recap once.Original variable created int A 22 How do we declare our pointer? We write int star. If we write int star, we will get a pointer to store the value of int. We named it PTR, store it in it or the address of edge. Now if we want to access the value stored at the address of the pointer here, then for that we will use star operator which we call value at address.Operator i.e. it will take out the value of whatever address is stored in that pointer. So it took out the value of 2 10 i.e. 22 and we assigned 22 to our new variable edge, so it goes here and gets stored. So, in this way, our points work. Let s try it once by writing a small code of it. First of all, we will declare a variable edge in which we are going to store 22. Now after that.We are going to create an integer pointer int star path i m per edge. Now here we can apply this star with an integer or with our variable.
