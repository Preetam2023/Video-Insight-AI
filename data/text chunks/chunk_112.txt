alyzed the output once. The output of the first statement is zero i.e. false four is not equal to 4. In this statement we are saying that four is not equal to four. Obviously this is a false statement, that is why zero is printed. In the second statement, we are saying that four is equal to four, so that is why one is printed. Now here, if we had said that four is not equal to three, orWe would have said that four is equal to three. In the first statement it will be printed. Why do we have one because we are right in saying that four is not equal to three and in the second statement it will be printed as false because we are saying that four is equal to three. Which is obviously false, then zero will be printed, so in this way, whenever we have to check equal to, we will put two equal to. Whenever we have to check not equal to, then equal to with exclamation mark is called not equal to. The next type of operator which we will talk about is our logical operators.
