iend? Suppose, I have given two to a here and a is the lesson, then the condition will never be hit. If it is smaller than two, then the loop will never work. Okay, so in the case of two, the number is prime, but if I write one here, what is happening here, then it comes here. If I write one here, then in the case of one too, friend.Here it is written that the given number is prime whereas one is not my prime. What will happen again in the case of one? If the value of n is one then aa mine will go from 1 i.e. till zero then our again loop is not going to run then the if loop will not run. In any case when the loop is not going on the same prime number is ours only then the value of our one does not change so that is why our number becomes prime. Here in the loop but it is not happening in one but one.
