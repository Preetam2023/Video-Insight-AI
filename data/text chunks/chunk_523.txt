ide this function, the value of count is increasing in the same way as the value of i is increasing. Now the i at the end, which is plus plus, already counts the null character, that is why in the end we need to return count 1, so we will return count 1 only then the correct count will come to us, now the name.Now if we send a different name then length seven is printed. Now if we send a different name then length four is printed. So in this way we can calculate the length of any string we have. We can create a function of our own. We have to go character by character and check things. If suppose inside this string, we have to check that whatever name the user is entering, how many times i comes in it or h comes in it, we also apply character by character loop andLet s check which character is equal to h and then add that count, then in this way a lot of cases can be made.
