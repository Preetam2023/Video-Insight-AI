loop, inside the loop, here it is written continue whenever inside the loop, when you saw the break.If it is written, then the loop itself ends and the code goes ahead completely. When continue is written, it means that round of the loop, that iteration of the loop, which I taught you the fancy word, skip it for now. Continue means skip that round, skip that round, skip that round of the loop, so whenever I did like two, then 2 muddled two is getting equal to 0 because so this round.It was skipped when the value of my aa increased to two. Look, okay then what happened, the value of aa increased to three, then the condition was not hit again. It came straight here and it was printed. Then the value of my aa increased to four. 4 turns into 0. Yes, see, continue. So in the next statement, we did not go to continue. Meaning, we skipped this round and came to the next round of the loop, in which the value of i will be fixed.
