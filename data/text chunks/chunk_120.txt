that 5 1 will give us true, but if we put not next to it, then in the output we will get false i.e. zero, if we talk about two expressions too.Do this i.e. 5 gr 1 which is it will give us true and and or and put here and and 3 gr 4 its output if we go to guess 5 gr the 1 will give true 3 gr 4 will give false between the two and and is true and one is false then the output will be false but outside all this we have put not so instead of false we are going to have true printed here we put another bracket in the output we know we haveIf it should be printed true then it is printed as true i.e. one. This is how our logical operators work. We will learn the actual importance of these logical operators in the next chapter when we will talk about conditional statements. Whenever we write conditional statements with if else then we have to put a condition inside it whether that condition is true or false. So there we use these expressions the most.
