have the output that is.This is Hello World, after that once again our Hello World has been printed. Now we want each Hello World to be printed in the next line, so let s save this and compile and run again. This time Hello World has been printed for us five times. Suppose if we had to print it 1000 times, then nothing, just change this five to 1000. Make a simple change inside our for loop and we can do any task any number of times.You can do this, you will see that when I scroll it, it is getting scrolled on top and Hello World is actually printed on the screen a thousand times. So if any work has to be done many times, then we can use for loops and now suppose I have to print the numbers from one to 100, then how will I get them printed with the help of loop. Now, if I have to print the numbers with the help of loop, then there will be some fashion of this method, when first comes one, then two, then three again.Then 5 6 and in this way our numbers till 100.
