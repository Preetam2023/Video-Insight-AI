hat eighth term so one thing is clear that our number of terms is number of terms so here we have n. Okay ifAll you are asked is that you have to find this sum 1 P 2 P 3 P 4 up to end terms, this is the sum of normal A, so you can do this very easily, how to put a for loop, keep adding to the sum, see, we do it, okay, let s just write it here, let s create a new file by doing sum of series dot C and write all our things here, copy paste it again, I am not, okay, we copy paste a basic code.Okay, let s write here and usually we delete all the things. Okay, so what have we done? Again, I have to take the input of one number, I have to do another number and enter the number, all the things are done, now I just have to find the sum, so the first question we ask is that if suppose I have to find this 1 P 2 P 3 P 4 then plus up to end terms, okay up to end terms, I have to find the sum of the for loop.By using or by using any loop, our code is going to be very simple.
