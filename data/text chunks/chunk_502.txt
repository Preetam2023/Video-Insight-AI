while and what will we do inside. Every time we are going to print our characters by doing print F. How will we get our characters printed?With the help of array of aa, now we know how to get the value by going to any specific index in the array, we give it by array of aa, that is, we put square brackets, this is our array notation, we can also do it with the help of points, but to me, the array notation for the things with arrays seems more simple. If we compare the edges to points, we will get it done with the help of arrays. Now what is the condition here?The condition has to be kept that whenever the null pointer appears at the index of the array, you stop the execution there, then this loop will run till the null character does not appear at the index of the array, then we write the condition for it, until our array of a is not equal to our null character, then this condition is most important, for how long will our loop run if we want to print all the characters.
