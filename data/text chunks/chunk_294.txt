ill be. This is the n which will tell which table of numbers is to be printed. This is its function.The n inside is empty so it does not have any value yet. Where will the value come from? It will come from the calling function. The calling statement will come from the calling statement. This statement here will be telling which number of table is to be printed and the variable which is written here, we call it parameter or it is also called formal parameter. It is formal i.e. it is for telling, the actual value will come from the calling one, it will give an argument.Here we have only formally told that there will be an integer value n. Here we do not need to tell that there will be an integer.
