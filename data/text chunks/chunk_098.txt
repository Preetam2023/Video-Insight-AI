so verify this. We will write the output, divide, compile, run six. This is because here 3 has come.Malla Ba 2 We have written that actually it should have been 2 Malla Ba 3 Let s do this Compile and run In the output we got 15 Third in the problem there are 5 Mad Ba 2 2 Ma 3 Now how to solve it because Didi we are seeing the bracket for the first time So whenever the bracket comes, first of all we have to solve the thing inside the bracket, this is the single thing which is the word.It matches with the mess that when the bracket comes, first open the bracket, then the thing inside the bracket will be solved first, that is, we will have this expression 5 ml ba 1 malla ba 3. What to do now, now two operations are left, this multiply and this multiply have the same president, so apply associativity rule, then we will have 5 3 i.e. 15. Its output should also be 15, so light here.Let s change it, put a bracket, save it, the output will be 15 and the last question inside this is 5 2 2 3.
