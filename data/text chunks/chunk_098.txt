ounds as actually in.We call rounds as iterations. You must have heard it or read it from somewhere. Those who don t know, we call it in fancy term. Iterative means one by one, gradually, okay, step by step, then the value of our aa is plus plus, aa becomes our three. Then checked whether my 25 is divisible by three, otherwise it is okay, this too is not printed back, nothing happened, moved ahead, then as soon as my friend came.Cut cut to four five came then saw is 25 diva module f equal to zero yes so what happened to our thing it got printed but then it increased to six became six checked it happened to seven then coincidentally what are the factors of 25 one is one factor of 25 so we know it is 2 and if f is equal to zero then there are only three ok so in this we came to know that my number is composite but do you know what is the problem this isThe loop is this, the loop inside this loop of mine has gone from two to 24.
