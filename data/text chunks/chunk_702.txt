are going to have any interview or any college test, then all these things are helping you in that. Now after finishing this course, I have tried my best to make it in such a way that all the basic concepts are clear for you and in fact you have learned it once, otherwise you can go to any language and learn the syntax of yourThat language will be covered within a week because all the basic topics that we have learned are similar to the other languages, what happens is that their syntax changes, so now you will not face any problem in learning the concepts of new languages. Now once we have learned C, the next step is usually that people learn a new programming language. After this, because there is a slight change in C.The missing thing is that if there are no concepts of object orientation in it, then we cannot create classes and objects here.
