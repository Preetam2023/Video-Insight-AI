and after coming out at the end, we can get anything printed. Suppose we get it printed at the end. We thank you, then this do it yourself loop will continue till the time our user, who is the even number, keeps printing even numbers.Keep entering, let s save it and run it. Enter number two. Next time we entered two, it got printed. Now next time we enter four, four got printed. After this, we enter six. Six got printed. Enter 18. Enter 18. We enter 20, so 20 got here. But if we enter an odd number, three, we put it here.But it got printed, thank you and this is where our program ended. So in this way, we can create a loop which will be controlled by the user s input. So we are making changes according to whatever input the user gives us. We are running our loop accordingly.
