d for this. Is it simple? Instead of sum you just put one in place of sum then see the answer again.Exactly right, I do enter number one, one will come, okay, the first term is our one, I say enter number two, then one will come, okay, here let s improve the code a bit that the fina s fina s key off percentage d is percentage d, so fina off simple, we can write here n is equal, look, I do f, so fina off f, that is, f fina term can also be written like this, if we remove the percentage d, then the fith is percentage.Percentage D A Okay see, I write six so the six is fina s term 8 Now I say friend my a the ana term 21 So I say on ya friend 15 the 15 phone s term is 6110 is quite a big number okay so we can solve this thing by doing like this fina by the way we can also solve the series in O of V also in a very simple way ok is the mathematics.
