we also write it with the help of percentage y, that is, here we will usually get hexadecimal value. If the address of the pointer is stored in hexadecimal form in the system, but if we want it in the form of normal numbers, thenWe cast the type, this percentage is y for unsigned int and percentage is p for our pointer address, so sometimes the pointer address may not look strange, hence we get it printed by giving it percentage as u. We will be learning both, we will see by doing both, we will also understand the differences in both with the help of code. What do we do first of all, let us look at our little syntax. First of all, we will see this line written in it, print a percentage p.Meaning, we are going to print the value of a pointer, we are going to print a memory address, after that it is written end . Whenever we write end and after that we write the name of a variable, meaning end is the address of, then we get the address of that variable.
