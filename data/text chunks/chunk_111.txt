sorry 93 is also composite I am so sorry of course I enter the number here 83 ok so that is a prime number for me ok so this is working for me but if I enter the number two then two is a prime number according to you what is the answer aga according to me it will give composite the number is prime ok the loop will not work oho I have written the right code by chance I am ok what is happening I was thinking thatLike here we were starting to divide by two, then if we divide two by two then the composite will be written but no prime number is coming, why is this if the number is two, I had said any number, look here, if my number is n, then I run the value of i from 2 to n 1, then if my number a is my z, then I will run the value of a from y to one, then the loop will not run at all.This means to shorten a loop from two to one. It is a simple thing, isn t it, friend? Suppose, I have given two to a here and a is the lesson, then the condition will never be hit.
