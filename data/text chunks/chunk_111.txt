have done 4, lesson 5 will be printed in this case.True, this is how our relational statements work. Now we have one last special relational operator which we call not equal to. We keep its name as not equal to. We used to call it equal to two. Whenever two values are equal, it will return one, whenever they are not equal, it will return zero. Whenever two values are not equal, it will return one and whenever they are equal, it will return zero, that is, both of them are equal to each other.Opposites are like if we want to write in our statement fur is not 4 and there we want to print 4 u 4 . Whenever we put exclamation mark in C programming, we always have to read it like not . Wherever exclamation comes, it means not not not, then not operator which is a separate operator. Now this is what it is and is complete, not is equal to two, we do not have space between these two.Now we have analyzed the output once. The output of the first statement is zero i.e. false four is not equal to 4.
