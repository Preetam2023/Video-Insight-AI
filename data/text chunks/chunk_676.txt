g dynamic with the memory, so in this topic we will be talking about four functions in this chapter. Majorly, the first function of which is our Malac Malac stands for memory allocation, the second is our Calc, Calc is continuous allocation, the third is our free function and the fourth is our Re Alloc i.e. Re.Allocation Now we will be reading about these four functions in detail in this entire chapter and all four functions are very easy to write. In fact, if I talk about a computer program, out of all the 10 chapters that we have read till now, this chapter should be the easiest because it has only four functions and we are going to understand it in a very easy way. First of all, let s talk about the function. The first function is our Malac. Now the work of Malac function is something special.Allocating the amount of memory Suppose you need 14 bytes of memory or 30 bytes of memory, then Malak will lock and give that memory to you.
