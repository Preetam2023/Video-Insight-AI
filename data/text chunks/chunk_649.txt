r file pointer, second is our format specified of variable, so first of all we will tell which file. If we want to read the data, then we will write F scan F, inside it we will write the file pointer, after that we will write what kind of data is being read, suppose we are reading a character from that file and after that where we have to read that character and store it, then for that we have already created a variable named character, so for that we have already created a variable of character type C in which we will read our data by characterizing it. Now how is this data being read like?What does scanf do? We press different keys from the keyboard and scanf keeps reading them. There is a similar system. All the data is written inside the file of fsnf. We have to learn that it is also being pressed like the keys of the keyboard and as we keep getting that data, in the same way it keeps getting scanned by f scanf i.e. it keeps getting input.
