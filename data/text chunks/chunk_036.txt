me because it is the last step. Then we saw whether seven is less than 6. Otherwise, the loop ended. The value of i that came in the last place was seven, so we gotYou can check all the things similarly, if here I write 10 and i i 2, which was earlier giving error, now it will not give error, now it will give value 11, so actually its value has become 11. Okay, here I have explained to you a little about the scope, but we can avoid this thing. Let us move a little further. We are going to discuss this a little more thoroughly in the next lecture.Let s move towards the questions. There are going to be a lot of questions coming because in this lecture we have already seen how to print n times. Coming to the next question, we have also seen how the loop works. The various parameters. I don t know why I made this slide. From which parameter were the various parameters. Our first one was our initialization ini script.
