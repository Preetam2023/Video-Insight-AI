going to read about the functions in detail. Any C program is always started from the main function.The execution will start and that execution will be line by line, that is, if this line has come first, then it will be executed, then this line has come, then it will be executed after this. Our main function gets finished. Now you will notice that behind every line we write a semicolon inside the code, that is, a semicolon is written behind this line too. A semicolon is also written behind this line. This semicolon is like a full stop in our line. Just like we put a full stop in Hindi, we put a dot at the end in the English sentences i.e. we put a period. Similarly, we show a semicolon inside our C program by putting a semicolon here.But our line is over, now whatever is written next belongs to the next line.
