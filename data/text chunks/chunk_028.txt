he box is made that is a different thing. If any thing comes inside the loop, then our step is this. Step number one is that first of all we are checking theCondition check condition, is my condition true, meaning we have seen that the value of aa is one, it is written here that aa should be less than 10, yes, go ahead, then we see what happens our friend step to step two, go inside the loop, go inside the loop and execute whatever is inside the loop, so here it is obvious that we have been given print, so it is written print hello world, so here we write hello world, if there is a base, then one.New enter will be done here, very good, then what happens is our step three. Step three is what is different in this case, that is updation. Now here friend, pay attention, what is the updation? Our updation is i i 2, so what is the current value of i. If it is one, then i 1 2 means that the value of i has become three, so this time it has not become two, this time our value has become three.
