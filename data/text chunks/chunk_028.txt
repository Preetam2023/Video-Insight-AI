ich are our whole can be either positive or negative like 1 becomes 2 becomes 5 becomes 1 becomes 0. So ifIf we have to store an edge, then edge is our whole value, usually, we will store it in int data type, so here we will write int edge is equal to 22, so from this line we came to know three things, first of all, the data we are storing is 22, the memory location at which we have stored it, we have named it edge and the type of data is integer value. Now similarly, if we have to store the value of pi, then ourThere is no integer, so there are decimal values inside it, that is why we will store it in float data type, so here we will write float, then we will write pi and we will give its value as 3.14, so this is a number with decimal values, we have stored it in float data type, now apart from this, there is another data type whose name is character, so whatever are our special characters, like it is hashed, it is rated on M, it has become star, that is.
