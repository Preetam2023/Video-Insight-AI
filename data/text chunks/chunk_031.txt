value of one cannot be negative 1 or 0 or negative f. The value of one will always remain the same. If the constant remains fixed, then we have 1 2 3 0 1 2 The constants of this type are called integer constants. After that come our real constants, real constants, that is, those which contain real numbers like one 0, now 1.01 is also there but it is a real constant, to show that its Pt 0 extra has been written. In the same way, Pt 0 extra of 2 has been written if it is onlyIf it was two, then it would have become an integer constant. Now it is a real constant. 3.14. Here we should have got 2.4. Then it would have been a real constant. Now we have the third type of constant. Character constants are what come in the characters. All our alphabets come in upper case. In lower case, we have capital A. Special characters also come, like we have hash, we have M percent.
