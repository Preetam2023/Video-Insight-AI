come five. The next thing that we will talk about is the next line which is a little more important. Let s see how now here we are using increment operator. What is this increment operator doing? If we break it down then star ptr star ptr 1, this method means andWe discussed that whenever Star PTR comes, it means a variable. Star PTR i.e. x 1 x, then the value ofPTR is getting plus. If PTR is not getting plus, then the pointer is not plus. Star PTR is not getting plus. The value on the address on the PTR pointer is getting plus plus. Here we get our value printed, we should get six and here also six should be printed. Compile it again and run. So now we have finally got six and star. PTR is also six, so how do we write the pointer.
