, so that s done for row and one, now we will start calculating FINA for two and calculate till n 1.So every time fina of aa what will happen fina of aa 1 ps fina of aa 2 I hope you must have understood this line, it is a very important line when we talk about the topic of finaz, what was the n one used to be n 1 p n 2 then what will be the aa i 1 p aa 2 is just a simple concept and then we will get it printed percentage d b t fina of i is printed thenFirst of all when the value of i becomes two then it will be calculated here 1 then the value of 2 will come to us and after that if we calculate for the value of 1 then it will be i then it will be 1 1 then it will come to us 2 after that if we calculate for the value of 4 then it will come to us 2 1 so this value will come to us 3 Now if we calculate for the value of five then it will beThree means this one will be three and two, then its value will come, we will have five and so on.
