before doing the recognition, we have to use a paper pen a little bit and a little bit of our brain. We have to think logically and find out how it will be repeated. We are doing these very standard questions in C. Ask mostly the same questions.Let us go inside the exam, there is no need to take so much tension, once you practice these questions and there will be one or two homework problems along with them, you will do it, you will not face any problem inside the exam, we have to find the factorial of n, so like what the sum used to say, if the sum used to say that if we want to find the sum of n, then find the sum of n 1, add n in it, something similar happens in our case, if you carefully follow the formula of factorial.Let s see what 5 factorial says. 5 factorial is 1 2 3 4 5. What is 4 factorial? 1 2 3 4. 3 What is FTO? 1 2 3. What is 2 FTO?So 4 fto is written as 3 fto 4. This can be written as 2 fto 3. This can be written as 1 fto 2. And this will always be our one.
