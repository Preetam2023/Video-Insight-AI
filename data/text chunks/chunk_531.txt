ent it out. First of all, let s create a character string, the first string, whose size we give 100.Inside this we are storing hello with a space, then we create another string second string, we do not need to give size in it, we store world in it and now what we will do is ATR CPY in which we will first pass the first string, then we will pass the second string and then we will print our first string to the user, we save and run, then after running, we have only world in the output because we have called STTR CPY whereas we had to net the concat, so ATR CT for concat.Let s call, now we have the complete Hello World printed. How did Hello World come? This Hello was already in the first string, now we have concatenated the world after the first string, appended it, but suppose here we do not write 100, what would have happened if we had written just this much, then once we run the program, we get an error and the program never executes.
