a vector actually. If I search for vectors, then in the list of vectors, we have some such figures. So, vectors are geometric entities. Those who have studied mathematics or mathematics, they will already know this.What are vectors? We have some entities which have a direction and along with it a magnitude, our y axis is now how to define vectors, vectors are straight lines on our 2D plane withLet s call it y capital y and it will have some distance from the y axis, let s call it KapiThe formula remains, this helps us programmers and coders not to get into the math thing. The simple concept is to remember that whenever a vector has to be defined, there will be anHow to calculate vectors in math, suppose we have the first vector x1 a cap y1 h cap and the second vector we have x2 a cap y2 h cap then the sum of these two comes out to us x1 x2 i ca That is, it will be stored inside a separate variable.
