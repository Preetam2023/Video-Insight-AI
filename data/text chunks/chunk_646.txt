then we just discussed that if F is in read mode inside PTR, then what would have come inside F PTR. If NULL would have come, then we can put a condition in it that if A PTR is equal to E is equal to NULL, in that case we will get it printed on the file dozen asist if it is not so.So it means that our file has been opened and now we will close the file, so we did a very simple thing, we had already read that if we open the file in read mode, if our file does not exist then what will happen, there will be null inside F PTR, so on the same we put a check that if F PTR is null then get it printed, the file does not exist and if there is any value in F PTR, then it is okay, there is no work right now, so let us close it.If there was any work to be done then here we would have written a statement in this way to get that work done, then save it once and run it, let s see what is the output. File creation exists because the file named New Test does not exist yet, we have not created it.
