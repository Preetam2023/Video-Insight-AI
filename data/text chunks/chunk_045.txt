but if I put this condition and print it again, then only that number will be printed which is even. Now why is this happening? Look, it is happening that inside this code, now I am showing you a dry run right here, I will not write, okay that whenI am going i 1 1 What is smaller than 100, print it exactly but here it is, is that one even an even number, otherwise this thing will not happen, print loop is over, enter back inside the loop, but before that, the value of i became two, is my 200 smaller than 100, what is it divisible by two, print it at all, so the things which were our even odd numbers, did not pass the condition, meaning this one.They are not able to pass the condition so they are not being printed but they are definitely coming in the loop. The value of i is going to be from 1 2 3 4 to 100. It is being printed only when it is even. Pay attention to this. Now, what is your homework, I will not do this thing, I will print all the odd numbers from 1 to 100.
