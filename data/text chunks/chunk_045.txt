and then we will write the variable, then the value of this variable will replace this percentage f. Whenever the output is printed, if we want to get the output printed for characters, then we will write percentage c and then we will writeOur variable will replace this percentage c here. So in this way, whenever we have to print any variable whose data type is some and whose data type is some, then for that we write percentage d in integer type, percentage f is written in real numbers and percentage s is written in characters and actually inside c we call these three as format. We specify in which format the output will come to us.
