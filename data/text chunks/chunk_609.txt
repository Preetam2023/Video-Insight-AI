create a structure named our address. After that we will create an array of the same structure i.e. what will we write? Structure address. This is our type infact. What can we do with it by type def? We can also create aliases. We will write here type def. Here we will write ourSo we can write ADD everywhere instead of writing on the structure address. Here for now, let s just look at the structure address. Then we will write the name of our variable. Addresses. For how many people. For five people. In this way, this will be our array of structures. Now in this, either input the information of the five people from the user or by assigning whatever value ourselves, we can get it printed. Now let s code and check the same thing.Let s put this code from here and now let s create a new structure named Structure Address.
