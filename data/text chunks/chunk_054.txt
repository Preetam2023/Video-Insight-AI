we write 2n in maths.Look here, if in mathematics we write it on a separate page, here we write it. In mathematics, the meaning of 2n is 2 multiplied by n 1. This is fine, but in computer, if I write 2n, then it is a different thing. It is a separate variable, but it cannot be a variable because the variable name does not start with a number, that is why red has appeared on the screen of our computer. It is fine, so in mathematics, if I have to write this thing, then I will write this only.By doing 2 in A then if I just put one in then everything is correct and the mass will follow then first this will happen then mine once and let s see directly or what did we write to print enter number I say I say till A we have to print d numbers so 10 then see 1 57 Now I say friend let s run it from back, first I am printing 50 d numbers lo brother 1 to 99 are printed okSo there is a different code, if I write here that I have to print first 100 code numbers, take brother, first 100, these number
