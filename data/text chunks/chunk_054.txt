definition of compilation is that it is a computer program that translates C code into machine code. So a compiler is a program that writes C code and translates it into machine code, like if a foreign guest has come to our Parliament.So there are translators in between. If the Prime Minister of French comes, there will be a translator in the middle who will understand his French and will convey it to the Prime Minister i.e. the Indian Prime Minister. In the same way, there are translators for languages inside our computers. The computer as it is, does not understand C. Our Windows machine is a Mac machine, it is linux.com. There was a file with C in it. We sent it to the compiler and what did the C compiler do? First of all, it will check that the file is C which defines the rules.
