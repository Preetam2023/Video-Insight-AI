some interesting thing. First we have written five and then we have multiplied it with size of int. Now this size of is our function and what does this function do? This function returns us the size of any data type. If we have written size of int then it will return the size of int. If we have written size of float.So it will return the size of the float. If we wrote size of character then it will return the size of character. Now according to my machine, I know that it will return four floats and one character. May be your machine is 32 bit or you are working on some other system. In that case, what is the size of integer. Should it return two for you or return any other size of any other data type? It depends on what is your system. According to your system, if you want to know how many bytes of memory does this data type take for me, then it will return this size of function.
