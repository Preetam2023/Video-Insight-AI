roll numbers of students, then for 100 students, we have created an array of students roll numbers. Similarly, if we want to store the price in float, thenNext we will write float then price and then price of 100 items, so here first we write the data type, then the name of the variable and then the quantity, first the data type, then the name of the variable, then the quantity. The same happens in structures too, we can make similar arrays of structures, first the data type i.e. our structure student, then the name of the variable and then quantity, first the data type, then the name of the variable, then the quantity. So here we have the array of structures.If you want to understand what has been declared, then first of all we have told the data type that the structure is Student, the data type of all three arrays is then we have taken EC, here we will store the information of 100 children of Electronics.
