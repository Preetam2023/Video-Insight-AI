eate a game.When we use C P in development, many times what we have to do is to define the velocity. At what speed are we going to fire the bullet? At what speed will we show the speed of our main character? What will be his velocity if someone has thrown something or let s say like in our Angry Birds, what will be the vectors in it, what will be the direction, what will be the Magni Doodle for throwing stones or birds.In all the work that is done, similar structures are used. This type of calculation is done which comes from the formulas of Math and Physics but we convert it into coding. The next question we will be solving is create a structure to store complexity. What were complexity numbers? There was a number whose part is real.
