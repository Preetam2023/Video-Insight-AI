ill be a positive value i.e. 1 1. This is because b a is here now and by doing one more small thing.Let s see, this time we change the string to h A A A and here we change the string to h H A B Here again we pass the first string and here we pass our second string Save and Run Now if you want to discuss with yourself before running, what will be the output, then inside the first string is H H H A, in the second string is H H H B. The different character inside both of them is which is the first, that is a and b. So again the esca of a will be minus the esca of b, then that of a.Escay is 65 Escay of b is 66, so this will also return a negative value to us, let us verify it, it will be printed and will come 1 and here if we remove a and b and now compare both of them, then now we are going to get zero because both the strings are the same, so if we want to compare the strings, then we can do that. This is a string comparison function.
