me. Now inside the name, all the characters that we want to store in our name string will be stored. Now here the size that we have given to the name is equal to 100 characters, so the next integer will be allocated after 100 characters, so 21 will come, after that 2110 will come, then the roll number will get space, if the roll number is of integer type.It will get the space of four bytes. Now after four bytes, 2114 will come where CGPA. CGPA is of our float type, so it will be getting the same amount of memory, so in this way, in contiguous fashion, i.e. in continuous fashion, we have memory locations stored one after the other. Whenever we create a structure, obviously, this format may change slightly according to some compilers and some according to the machines.If someone asks, then by default this is what we assume. Next is a practice question. Let s not do it. The practice question says, write a program to store the data of three students.
