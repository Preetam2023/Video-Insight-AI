We write the sum of digits is the sum. Okay, so let s run this code once and see enter a number 1 2.3 4 So our sum should be 10 So look the sum of digits is 10 Okay let s run it once again here let s write 9999 So our sum should be 36 So look the sum of digits is 36 So it is working I hope you have understood this code This is your homework, now it is class work Actually you can dry run it and see for yourself There are many similar questions.What I am going to do in the next question, isn t it friend, it is very terrible, it is a very good question, that question is our friend, I have given good homework, never mind, let s do the terrible question later, first of all you look at your homework, solving it yourself is the homework, our write a program to print the sum of all the even digits of a given number, meaning if I have been given n 1 2 3 4 5, then my sum should be which is myWhat you have to print will be 2 4 i.e. only six. Now think for yourself how to do it.
