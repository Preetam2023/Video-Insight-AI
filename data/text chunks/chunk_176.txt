rks, I try very hard to give more grades so that even if a child has got less, he does not feel bad. While watching the video, in this case this grade will be given and then we will write else if this time marks are greater than equal to our 70 and end 70 and end marks are less than 90 then in this case we are going to print same conditions print.We will do A and last but not least, our Else case will come in which we will print A or A for ourselves. Teachers don t give much plus plus, so these are our four conditions which we have written in the form of fff else , we will open the terminal window, we will compile, we will run the code. Now we have to enter our marks. Let s assume that my marks of Physics are 98, wow I got an A .
