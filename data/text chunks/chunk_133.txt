, we take two variables. The first variable is int is Sunday. The second variable is int is snowing. So now if we put true in is Sunday and if we put true in is snowing then we print F. This is Sunday.When it is true and end is snowing, when it is true then only we have true print i.e. this is also true and this is also true. If it is Sunday and it is snowing then only we will print true, so already we have kept both of these as true. Let us see whether our output is coming true or not, then we have true in the output. Let us assume that it is not Sunday, there is some other day, then this Sunday will be false and now if we run it, then in the output,We will get zero because one of the two conditions fails and what does the end do? If even one condition fails then it will make the whole false. Now the second question says if it is Monday and it is raining then make it true.
