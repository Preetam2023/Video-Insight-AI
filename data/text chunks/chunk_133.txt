is code, I will show you and explain what is the problem with this code. It is okay, it is an error. Of course, if seen technically, then we write here predict one dc and we do a littleLet s create a file here for the while loop by copy and pasting, okay again and again, so we don t like to write things down a bit, we have written int j, then while j lesson equal to 10, then print a is j is yes of course and we have given here back sl a j is j p. Okay, so let s run this code and see the problem. Nothing happened, nothing happened, the code didn t even run. Let s see once, nothing happened. Okay, once.We print j and see what will happen before the loop, meaning the thing has not gone inside the loop. First of all, if nothing has happened, it means that the condition has never been hit. I do one thing, print F command C. Let s print it directly. We have created a box named j . We want to know what value of j will be printed.
