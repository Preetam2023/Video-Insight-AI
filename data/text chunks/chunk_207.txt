I mean anytime I say 10 factorial then you must have understood its answer.10 10 9 8 keep reducing one number by one in 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ok what does n factorial mean friend n n a smaller number than n 1 whatever it will be I don t know then n 2 up to so on will keep multiplying till one ok of course factorial a For Bhi, you assume that this is just defined. For natural numbers, our meaning is for whole numbers. Well, it means 1 factorial, 2 factorial, 3 factorial. It would not be that 2.5 is 5 factorial. Okay, for now, don t consider it. Well, there is one more thing for us. Here, 0 factorial is also my one. Now why does this happen, you don t have to pay attention to this thing, it s okay, this permutation.
