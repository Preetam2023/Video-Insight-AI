leave any of the three blank. The problem is this.Errors come and what errors come. Now we will see. If we left this statement empty, then this loop is not knowing. The C compiler is not knowing when to end this loop. This loop will keep going on and on. How will it keep going on? If we run it, then this loop will keep printing Hello World until the memory of our computer is completely filled, so that is why we closed it. That is why it is important that we always do not miss any condition.As long as we know that our code is running properly and we have to pay a lot of attention as to which condition is going to do what and this kind of loop which never ends keeps on running forever, we will make it infighting, it will not stop infighting, whether we will create apps in web development related or anything else or go to the company and actually go and develop, then when you have to do coding there, then such mistakes are very basic mistakes which you should not make at all.
