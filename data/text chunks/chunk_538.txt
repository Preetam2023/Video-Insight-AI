me, so if we want to compare the strings, then we can do that. This is a string comparison function. If we look at real life cases, then where can it be used?This can be used if we create a function that is forming our dictionary. What happens inside the dictionary? The letters come first in the alphabet, which means they have less values, so they come first inside our dictionary and the rest come after us. So, we can sort them according to the negative value, which has the least negative value, meaning the more negative it is, the sooner it will come inside the dictionary, the more positive it is.That much will come inside the dictionary later, so in this way, whenever you have to compare the characters, which character is smaller at the beginning of the dictionary, the bigger one is at the end of the dictionary. We will talk about it next.
