would have happened, then our answer would have been 3. Okay, if n 10, the answer would have been 5. So you have evaluated a formula that if my n is even or you can write directly if n is equal to 2 equal to 0, that is, it is even.My code can be directly said in this case which is my even, the value of even is n ba 2. Okay why brother you can see if there is eight then always 4 answer will come n 10 I will take 5 answer will come see here 9 10 then this one and 1 will come. If you understand then pairs of two are being formed because this is a very simple thing. You must have understood then directly I can write if n is even then the answer is this.
