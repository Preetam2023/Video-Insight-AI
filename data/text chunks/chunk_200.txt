so we have one.Got it printed but now this value has been increased with the internal compiler i.e. now if we again check the value of i If you want to print i, this time we will not do plus plus, this time we will simply write i, so here the value of i was printed as one, now by becoming plus plus, internally that value has become two and here when we will print i again, we will know how it has become two. Let us compile it. Run i.e. earlier it was one, now it has increased internally, not used, after that it is used again in this second line, if it is used.The value which was two got printed to us and right here, if we had taken aa for the same variable, then what would have happened in that case aa says increase then use i.e. first increase then increase the value, hence plus plus has already been told plus plus means first increase and then use the value of i, then it will increase and later the value of i will be used, we comment it out once and save and end.
