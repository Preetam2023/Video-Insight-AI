ught of this ok if you want to make it better then you can do one thing, first you write the number.You can see like this and later you can do this work, okay write it like this, okay now let s print it once and see a nice print will come out, a value of a is 65, b is 66, c is 67 and so on, z is 90, I hope you have understood this question, let s go ahead, this is your homework, this is a good question, it is okay to try it yourself. Write a program to print out all the Armstrongs.Numbers between 1 and 500, so you have to run a loop, you have to count from 1 to 500, you just have to see which are the numbers from 1 to 500 which are Armstrong numbers. Look, what is Armstrong number? If the sum of cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself then the number is Armstrong number. It is a very amazing thing like 153 is an Armstrong number, why?How many digits are there in 153? 1, 5 and 3. Okay, what is amazing is the cube of 1 the cube of 5 the cube of 3.
