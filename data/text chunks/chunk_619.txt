structure to store complexity. What were complexity numbers? There was a number whose part is real. And some part was imaginary, some part of it would be real, some part would be imaginary, just like a vector, we have to create a structure, we will name it of complex type and our inner part is also of integer type, we will be creating some structure like this and we have to print the value from the arrow operator, so first of all, what will we do above, let s create a structure above the structure complex term terminator, then this is our done.Inside the complexation, we will create the actually complex number. First of all, we will write that we want to keep the strict complexation part and now how will we get it printed. It has to be printed with the arrow operator and for the arrow operator, we need a pointer, so first of all let s create a pointer. What will be the type of pointer? Structure complex of number one. Now we have to print the values, so we can get them printed.
