to include children due to which an error occurs, so we should not forget the statement terminator.Now let us discuss once that data types are of two types, one is our inbuilt data types which already exist within our programming language like we have integers, our floats or our characters or in fact arrays also come under this category. Now on the other side we come to the user defined data types. User defined data types are created by the user till now if we wanted an integer then it was.Already exists in the memory, that integer character means that four bytes have been saved for you in the memory. If a character was required, then it was also already existed. C programming tells that if the character already exists, then you need one byte. If you want to store any character, any letter or special character, then already exists in C programming. But suppose if we want such a data type in which for float inside we need four bytes of integer character.
