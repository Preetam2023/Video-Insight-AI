ond rule that says about the variable in c says that the first character is alphabet and underscore. What does it mean that whatever is the first character in the name of the variable, it is either a normal English letter.It can be a character or it can be an underscore. Apart from this, there cannot be any other value, like if we had to store an edge, what did we write? Here we wrote int edge, we could have written it in this way also, int a 22, but we cannot write it like this, hein a 22 because here our red line will come and it will become wrong. If we want to write even one edge here, then it becomes red, that is, wrong, only any English character or underscore.Only this can come in the name of the variable. Our third rule says no comma and blank space, that is, there can be no comma and no blank space in the name of the variable, like if we want to store a final price, then we will write int final underscore price e e 1.
