g we do? The condition is checked like it is done. Come inside the loop. Okay, come inside the loop.Come inside the loop, like this thing has only one statement written inside, we can also write multiple statements, do whatever is written inside, it said print F. So it is done, now come inside the loop, do whatever, after this we see, we do whatever we do in the updation, friend, we are given a thing in the updation, like it is written here i i 1, so as soon as we did this, the thing got updated, the value of i is okay, then repeat again because there is a loop, so what are the steps, we have steps here friend that nut 3 back 1 2 3 then 1 23 This will keep happening like this until our condition fails, okay friend, this is off course, all these things can be changed but you must have understood the rough meaning of what happens to us in the for loop. Now let s solve this question first of all and then we will know a little more about it slowly.
