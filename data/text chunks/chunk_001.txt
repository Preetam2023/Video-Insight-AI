Hi Everyone and Welcome to the Complete Python Series, in which today we are going to complete part two of our UPS i.e. Object Oriented Programming. In this part, there will be inheritance, polymorphism, we will cover the important concepts of this method, implement them and then solve practice questions based on them. Apart from this, if you want to read any topic of Python.So they are available in this playlist above this channel, so we can go and watch them, we will find the link to download And Like Always Notes in the description box below, from there we can access our slides, so let s start with our next lecture, so oops in the chapter, we are going to read the next concept like this is the del keyword del keyword is used to delete object properties or the entity itself any object.

Large language models like Chat GPT can answer almost all types of questions but when it comes to providing authoritative answers with sources, these models get a bit stuck because they give answers on the basis of their training data. They do not take that answer from real time sources and their training data is not always up to date. So what is the solution to this problem? Here comes an excellent technique called retrieve.Augmented Generation or RAG Let us understand what this RAG is, how it works and what can be done using it. Hello, I am Vikram Singh Chandel Your own Analytics Music Praise Music Guru Retrieve Augmented Generation or RAG is a technique that makes generative AI models more accurate and reliable by bringing facts from external sources. Basically this technologyFixes the issue of accuracy and reliability of LLM. With this, LLMs are able to answer general prompts faster.
