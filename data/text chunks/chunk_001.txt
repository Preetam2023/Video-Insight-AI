Large language models like Chat GPT can answer almost all types of questions but when it comes to providing authoritative answers with sources, these models get a bit stuck because they give answers on the basis of their training data. They do not take that answer from real time sources and their training data is not always up to date. So what is the solution to this problem? Here comes an excellent technique called retrieve.Augmented Generation or RAG Let us understand what this RAG is, how it works and what can be done using it. Hello, I am Vikram Singh Chandel Your own Analytics Music Praise Music Guru Retrieve Augmented Generation or RAG is a technique that makes generative AI models more accurate and reliable by bringing facts from external sources. Basically this technologyFixes the issue of accuracy and reliability of LLM. With this, LLMs are able to answer general prompts faster.
