code. Now we have to enter our marks. Let s assume that my marks of Physics are 98, wow I got an A . Whereas if you want to enter any other subject, then we can also enter that likeSuppose we have got 40 in a subject, then our grade in it will be B, then in this way you can make a small mini project of your own in which you can apply the formula to calculate your grade according to your marks, which is your curriculum sheet of your college or school which defines what grade will be given on how many marks, or even if you want to make an application of supermarket, how much tax is to be levied on which items and the final value after levying the tax.will come You can make a program for that too, so many such programs would have been given in the homework problems also.
