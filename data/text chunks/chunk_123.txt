very easy operator. The easiest operator which is going to be our assignment operator is to assign. We have already read what does equal to. If a is e b then it will put the value of b in a. If c d then it will put the value of d in c. If e f g h then it will put the value of this entire expression in e. This is the work of assignment operator. After that, our plus equal to operator.This is basically our short hand operators. What are short hand operators? What do they do? Let us tell you how to shorten the long and difficult statements. Like if we have written a a p b, if we write this thing in our code, int a 1 int b 4 and we want to write int or a a p b, then what should come here, b is 4, a is 1, p 4 will be 5, then the value of a will now become F.By printing it, we can tally it. If five comes in the output, then the value of a becomes five because by combining four and one it becomes five. Now we will notice that a is written on the left and a is written on the right.
