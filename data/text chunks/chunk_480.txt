ext question which we will talk about is how to write a program to store the first and fobo numbers. We have already talked about the fobo numbers, so the sequence created is something like this 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 Our 21 And so on nowThe special thing about Fina number is that if Eth number comes If you want to find out, then add n 1 p n 2th number, then first of all we have to create a phone number in which we can store n numbers, then to make it we will take the help of an array. We comment out this entire code. Comment out this too. First of all, make an integer, A. This integer A will tell how many numbers are required, then we ask the user to print A, enter A, scan the value of A, percentage, D andNow what will we do now that we will create an array, let s name this array as Fina and we will give its size equal to n i.e. n numbers will be stored inside this Fina. Now we know that Fina of one row is row and Fina of one is always one.
