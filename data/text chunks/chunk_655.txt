ional things to that data. Next let s talk about what if we read a file only character by character.One thing you have to do is to apply format specification by applying percentage C and then do F print F or F scanf, otherwise there are two special functions for this inside the files, the first function of which is F get C and the second function is F put C. What does F get C do? Get C means get character brings the character from inside the file and F put C puts a character inside the file, so it is used to read the characters.And this is used to write the characters inside the file. The syntax of both of them is quite simple. What you do inside F get s is simply put your file pointer, that is, earlier our syntax was going on, what we were doing with F scanf, first of all we used to put the file pointer, after that we used to put percentage C and after that we used to put the address of the character in which we have to read and store the data.
