i.e. this is the real name of our structure and this is its nickname by which we will be calling it. We will write the alias and after that we will write the statement terminator and now if we have to create a variable of the same structure then simply write the alias i.e. we will just write COE here.Student one then a computer and an engineering student one. So let s try it once. First of all, what will we do? Let s remove our code in the main function. Let s create an alias for our assisting student. Here we will write type def. So in front of structure student, simply write type def and in the last its alias is the alias for the student. We have created stu and let s save it. So earlier what we used to do was earlier we used to write structure student s1.Instead of this, now we have to simply write s2 i.e. this entire structure student has been replaced by AU only. Now we neither have to tell the structure nor do we have to create student. Simply we can write ST U.
