ries.Get a random number printed for you, the clerk in your system will never guarantee that only 0.0 will come, in some cases it may come, in some cases it may not come, but if you want to make the initialization easier from the row, then always use Calc because it can take a guarantee for you. Now let s talk next. This is the question of our practice question. Our question is something like this, write a program to allocate memory of size n. This is n size of memory that we have to allocate. Where n is entered by the user. Now what is meant by saying n size is that n is multiplied by size of int. Here we will be taking that we have to allocate memory of n integers. So let s see this also. First of all, we will create an integer pointer ptr and an integer n.Now we will take our integer n input from the user. Enter n Next what will we do. Now we have to allocate this n size of memory. So pt01 n till i end every time we will be printing the percentage d ptr of aa.
