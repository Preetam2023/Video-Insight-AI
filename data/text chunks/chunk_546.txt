create a new string. New password in which it will copy the old string plus add our tooth behind it. So inside the main function first of all we create a character string. The password can be of 100 characters. Maximum, we will take input of this password from the user i.e. Scan F Percentage S. Our password is now inside this password.We are going to make sure that there are no spaces, so we can use percentage S and then we will call a function saltis, let us also create a function, this function will return nothing, it will just print the new password and give it to you, then its return type is void, salt, inside this we will get the character password. Let us create this function, void sorting character password. First of all, we define our string which we have to add, so our character is salt to 3, now one.Create a new character in the new password and double its size. So, first of all we have to copy our password inside the new password.
