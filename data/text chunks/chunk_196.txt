Let s run it once and see. I put the number seven, the answer is four. Is it really four? Let s try.Friend, this is what I have to do, what do I have to do, friend, I have to do 1 2 then P 3 then 4 5 6 P 7 Ok so I have to do Y so let s add and see E is equal to 1 2 How much is our love 1 1 P 3 is our 2 2 4 How much is my love 2 4 Either do one thing add all the things and do all the subcutsSo we can write it like this, it s simple maths, let s say none 1 3 5 7 and then 2 4 6 so look 1 3 4 4 5 9 9 7 is our 16 16 minus how much is ours 16 2 is our 14 14 4 is how much is our 10 10 6 is how much is our 4 Okay so ourAnswer Ofcourse, only four is coming here, ok, how do you want, you try it, ofcourse, this thing is true, I hope you like this code. You must have understood, it was a very simple code but it is a bit taxing for the computer. Look here what does this code mean. Suppose our A is 1000. Okay, if A is my Haj, then what is happening if A is 1000, then my loop will take Haj iteration.
