nd again, then item mation means doing any work repeatedly in English. It is a counter or a counter. Just like we keep track of the counters above the shops, how many customers have come, similarly here is it a counter or a counter?It is a matter which is tracking how many times the work is done, if we write 10 here and here the condition says that work should be done till it is greater than one and the update condition says that it should be reduced by one, then we know that our counter is telling us, our iterator is telling us that our loop is going to run 10 times. Now let s ask a question on for loops. Question of ours is this print the number from 0 to 10. We need to row from 10 to 10.We will look at this question carefully because till now we were printing numbers from one to 10, this time zero is also additional and if we count all these numbers, then these are total 11 numbers. Here is a small confusion which happens to the students in the initial stages.
