an index, like if I have an array, suppose there is an array named Marks which has a lot of numbers.Marks of the students are stored 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 So if you see the type of these marks then it is actually a pointer and where does it point? It points at the desired location of the array. So whether we write this line meaning the address of the desired location or we directly write the name of the array, both are equal, the syntax of both is different, but both mean the same, so in this way.The name of the array is a pointer and it is a very important thing which we have to remember because it is asked in the questions. Now if we have to travel on an array, i.e. go from one place to another, if there are 100 elements inside the array, then we have to move them one after the other.
