t. To read the data of any file, we have to first open it and after reading it, we have to close it. We can read the data from it and can also write the data in it, i.e. we can write the data. First of all, let us talk about the types of files.Within our system, we will mainly talk about two types of files, the first of which is our text files. The data inside the text files is textual, that is, if you open it and look at it, you will not see the real data, ABC, D, A, sentences will be written in it or some numbers will be written in it, which means when the opened data will be visible to you, it will make sense. The second type of files for us are our binary files. The data inside the binary files is stored in the form of rows and keys.Or there will be a big sequence in which there will be days and ones and that will not be making any sense to us. We call that type of file a binary file. Now the binary file also has different types.
