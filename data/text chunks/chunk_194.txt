1 to A terms, I have come up with the sum and I will not even do a dry run of it. It is very simple. Now what do we have to change, if instead of this we just have to do 1 2 p 3 minus f. Okay, then here plus 5 minus sps and so on. So it is a very simple thing. Look at the observation here, what is my observation that all the odd numbers are there.Okay, they are being added and all our even numbers are being subtracted. Okay, even numbers are being subtracted. From the total sum, like our sum is 2, that is, 1 3, that is, 2 2 4. Do you understand that this is how our answer is going to be here, okay, so whatever it is, we can do one thing. Let s use the FL statement here. Let s end the story.Friend, don t do this directly, let us remove it. Now, all the odd numbers we have, if i is an odd number, then the odd number is this. If it is not divisible by two, then it is not divisible by two. Not equal to zero is ours anytime.
