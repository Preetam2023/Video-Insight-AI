decrement this variable, meaning updating does not always mean increasing the value of the variable.Meaning, we can also reduce the value of the variable, like if I had to print values from 100 to 100 or let s say from 10 to 1, then I would start the value of i from 10 and then keep increasing the value of i till it gets reduced by one less than 10 to one. Every time I will update in the form of i i 1 and will run the loop till i is our greater than equal.T is not 1, meaning if the value of i is one then the loop will still run. If the value of i is two then the loop will still run. Even if the value of i is three then the loop will run and how is the loop running? First of all the value of i is 10, after that it will become nine, after that it will become eight. After that it will become seven. 6 5 4 3 2 1 As soon as one is updated, the value after one will become zero. After that this loop will not run. Now let s save it once and run it. This time our values will be printed.
