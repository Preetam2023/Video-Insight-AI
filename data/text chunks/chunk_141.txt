we look at a condition and act accordingly and get anything done are called conditional statements. Coming to the category of conditional operators, now whenever we talk about conditional statements in C, we will read two types of statements, the first of which is our FL statements and the second is our switch statement. If means in English, if and else means if that thing does not happen then do this thing, then our FFL statements are formed in this way. Now if we look at the syntax, how to write FFL statements.So first of all we write the if keyword. This is a keyword of C. It means that the compiler of C already knows what the meaning of if is. Then we put parens and then we write any condition inside it. Now we have already read the conditions. How will we write any relation whether our character is equal to m? In that case get it printed as Monday or marks.
