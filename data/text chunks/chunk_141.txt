e to predict an output. I have given intex e 4 y 3 and then I have given z. Okay, so a box was made.Minus minus, when I used to write it directly in print F also, okay, what was its significant? First thing, what it did was, it would keep the original value of x and then decrement the value ofIf y is treated like 3 then the value of z will be 4 3. Second thing is x minus minus so first we took out the value ofNothing will be printed. One will be printed in the next line, one is entered, then percentage DD is corresponding to one, this is to y, this is to z, what is the value ofSo the value ofAnd one enter, okay, this is the space, that s why I have given the space, okay, let s move ahead and solve the next question, my next question is also giving the exact output, while here.
