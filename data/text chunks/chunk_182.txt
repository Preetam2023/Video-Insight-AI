ich is our if sich if our greater than equal tool is A and and C is our lesson is equal to sloppy then in that case we are going to print lower case. Now apart from this, our ast risk is M percent, all those are also hashtag hash character this.All the characters are present in it, we will print not English letter. It is not an English letter. You have printed some other character and given it to us. After all this, let s put a next line, save it and run it. Now we have to enter the character. Suppose first of all we are entering for GG. It told that it is upper case character but if we enter small G then it will say that it is lower case and if we enter percentage.If you enter this character then it will tell you that it is not an English letter. So in this way we can make our entire program which is checking whether it is upper case or lower case. Many good programs can be made in this.
