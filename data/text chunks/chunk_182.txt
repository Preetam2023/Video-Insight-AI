32 and again by dividing it by 10, I will make it one. Again, I have 432 lying with me, I have 43 2.If I want 1 then I can write it 4320 1 then multiply 432 by 10 and add one to it. Then again I will multiply this by 10. 4320 and I will add this digit to it which will become 4 3 2. I will divide 1 by 1. So here I will be left with 10. Sorry, 10 will be left with me. I have zero and as soon as it becomes zero, then the condition is over, then you are getting the understanding from here that which steps are we following. First of all, friend, we are adding in aa, is the last digit okay, so I can say that in aa, I am adding the last digit, we know how to find it, meaning instead of the last digit, we can also write this, all the time, n is 10, okay.Here we said that when we did this work, we got four but we have to multiply it by 10 also, so we will keep r by multiplying it by 10. Okay, then we will divide our n also by 10.
