hat the value of x is now five and the value of y is now three, it is possible to call by reference. With the help of this, because we passed the pointer, we passed the address and we created points inside our function, that is why the value which is at the address is interchanged, so our function can return only one value, but when we want multiple values, then what we can do is pass the address of a variable inside it and get the changes done there, store it inside that variable and bring it back.The function will not have to return anything and you will get your value, then in this way we use call by reference when we have to return multiple values from one function. We do not return those values with the help of return, we return them with the help of points. So I hope this concept will be clear now, the next question which we will talk about, the next question says will the address output be the same.
