ake the modus by 10, that is, five is okay last.I got my digit and then I started talking to myself. Inside m, the sum is our initial Y , I write Sam , what is mine now, is zero, if it is lying at zero, then inside the sum, I will add Sum is equal to sum plus the last digit. So see now what is the value of Sum , the last digit is my F , okay for now, see, from here, my last digit becomes F , so if I add F inside the sum, then F has come. Okay, now what will happen next, I will keep looping in it again and again but from that.First of all, it is necessary to divide n by 10, why because see, then I would need this digit also, why am I dividing 4 n by 10? See, once I divide n by 10, my n here is 1 2 3 4 5, it becomes 1 2 3 4. Now let s look back once again, this thing will run in my loop, everything is fine, I will take out the last digit by doing n modelo 10, okay.So for now ours is 1 2 3 4. n is modified by 10 so the last digit becomes my four.
