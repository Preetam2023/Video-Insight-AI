e than 30 then the child has passed. If it is less than 30 then our child has failed. Then the same.If we have to convert the situation into code, then first of all what we will do is enter the marks. Here we will create this variable. Enter the marks and give the range of marks from zero to 100. Some children also get zero and those poor people get absent on the day of paper. And here we will write the marks. Now we have to write two conditions, one for pass and one for fail. So first of all let s try to write it with a fuffle in if.will put if If the marks given in our question are less than 30 or less than equal to 30, then in that case we have to print it as fail and if it is not so, then in that case we have to print it as pass. So here we will open the terminal, compile run marks, we will put ours, we will put 56, we have passed. Let us run it again and assume that we have put 105 because we are the devil children of the class and even after putting 105, we passed.
