n input, everything is done. Now instead of int sum, we write int reverse. It will be reversed by r. So we can always use the last digit, there is no big deal in it, this time let s do one thing, don t use it.It s simple, we can use n model 10, okay, so what is the condition inside the code, my condition is the same, while n is not equal to 0, this time I am writing it like this, greater than 0, the same thing, okay, what did I have to do, if I look back in my pen copy, I have written, first of all, I will add r as I saw, n will add 10 to ya, which means the last digit.I will add it, okay, so r r ps last digit and we know that our last digit is always this, so I can also write this directly, I do not need to create a new variable, okay then what I do is I will multiply r by 10 also, man, r has to be multiplied by 10 also, why because next time I will add some things like here when my r was four, then I will not add three to four.
