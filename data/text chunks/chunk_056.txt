creen, then now we have understood the basic basic concepts of C and till now we have got some idea.Is it actually programming, then in this we will solve two such questions which if you are studying in college then usually from basic, if you are asked any easy level questions then they will look like this. The first practice question which we will solve is Write a program to calculate area of a square, so we have to calculate the area of the square, we have the side, we have given, we know math, we have studied in small class.What is the area of a square? Side multiplied by side. So what we will do is create a program that We will take input to the front side and then give output to the area. Let s try this thing inside our code. Let s write a comment on the area of the square. First of all, we will define a variable on the side. After that we will print F. Enter the side. Now take it from scan F. As the input, we will write percentage D. End side.
