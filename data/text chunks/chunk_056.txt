our 4, 4 p n 1 3, so in a generalized way our thing is coming here whose value is 4 p 3n 3 so 3n 1. Okay, so this is the eighth term, that is, this is our last term that is going to be the condition and our increment is the difference from three.My term is increasing, it s simple, friend, what can I write in my for loop, friend, you must have understood the condition of my for loop, first of all, it is starting from four, a 4, so this is our initial equation, then 4, then I will write aa, lesson is equal to two, what is written here, not lesson is equal to this condition, 3n my then 3n of course 3 n 1 andThe condition will be i a p 3 because there is a difference of th and then friend, I will write my code here, whatever my code is, basically this is A, I have to print A, why do I have to print A, I have to print the value of my K, so here I simply write, what to do is print my K, F print A, percentage D, also give a space and print A, so if you run this exact code, this is our A will
