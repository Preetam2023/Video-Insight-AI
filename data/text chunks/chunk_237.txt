side our do loop, we will take the number from scanf inside the do loop. So in this way, every time.The number has come in the input and just for fun, we also get this number output. Percentage d, what number we have got, what is the number and what is the condition that we have to keep. In this case, either we can keep that as soon as our n is odd, our n becomes odd, we go out, but in this case, in the condition, we just write. What does it mean to write one in the one condition, we are writing true, every time the condition will be true, no matter what comes.We are always putting the number true inside our condition. Till now the loop we have made is this do while loop in a repeating manner until our condition fails but the condition will never fail because we have put one there but there is a way to avoid it inside that we break and how to break. We will break when our condition comes i.e. as soon as the user has entered an n which is an odd number.
