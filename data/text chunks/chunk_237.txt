that that is the eighth final number. So I will do two first. Just write the number here n 2. Okay.I will run the loop less number of times, if I need 6 times, then I will run the loop four times, then it is a simple thing, so see, if the number is n, then I am going to run the loop n 2 times, so much maths, you must be understanding it, okay friend, so let s see here, whether there is any shortcoming, like suppose I write enter number, because look, it is going from one to n 2, so if I enter the number three, then the answer is two, yes, third.Our term is two, it is correct, then if I put four, then that will also be the correct answer, three, fourth term is my three, fifth term is five, rest all are.
