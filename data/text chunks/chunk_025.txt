ut. Do a dry run on pen and paper yourself. Look here, it is the same thing, the same question, i.e. instead of i p, if I had basically written i i 1, instead of this, if I write i i , okay and give a number here, 10, let s remove these two for once, let s make it a little simpler for you, then think a little and tell me how many times Hello World is printed.What is going to happen is a very simple thing, if I do i a p 1 and I told you, this is a normal code, it will run 10 times, so whatever is inside will be printed 10 times, okay, I will put that on this also, now let s run it once, see, my hello word has been printed 10 times, it is ok, actually I had not set the value of n 10 times, my hello world friend has been printed here right here.
