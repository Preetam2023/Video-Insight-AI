to give meaningful names there, so if you go ahead, you can keep names like ABC in your interviews.If we sit in companies for placements or if we are making our own project and do good level freelancing, then we have to write the names of our variables very well inside it, like if we had to store only 100, then we could have written only F here directly, but we wrote the full name Final Price so that it can be understood that 100 is a price. Now the next thing about which we will read after the variables is our data types. There are many data types inside C.We have given you a list of these different data types and all these slides will be available to you in the description box below, so there is no need to remember anything here, in fact we do not even have to remember all these, there are some such things which are useful while coding. If we will definitely remember, then all the things which are there remain in the mind.
