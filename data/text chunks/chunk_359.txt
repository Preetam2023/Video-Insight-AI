able is created, a data value is stored inside it. The name of that variable is the memory location.And there is an address of the memory location, but today we felt that we should not store the data value i.e. these 22 in a variable, we have to store one memory location, one memory address, so in whatever variable we store that memory address, we name that variable as pointer, like if we have to store the memory address of this edge variable somewhere, then for that we will create a new variable, let s say this.We have given the name of the variable PTR which is short for pointer, now inside it will be stored the memory address i.e. 2010 which is the memory address of Edge but it will also have its own memory address because this location will also exist somewhere, this is also a variable, it is just a variable which is storing the memory address of another variable, so I hope that we have understood the basic thing, now the variable.
