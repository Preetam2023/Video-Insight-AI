R is storing the address of our X and then indirectly storing it inside the address which is on PTR.If we are zero then first of all we will try to print the value of percentage d b nWe have zero printed in both the cases because both the values are zero. Now let s move to the next line. The next line seems even more important to me. The next line is called Star PTR 5. Let s mark this line as important. Break it up a bit and it says Star PTR Star PTR 5. What does it mean to say that the address in the pointer means the valued address at the pointer?Means 2000, whatever is the address, whenever we are writing star PTR here, it means x star PTR. What is the address ofIt will become 5. Now the value ofSo five will be printed here and here also we will have five. Let us verify this also. Now we have both the values which were zero earlier, now they have become five. The next thing that we will talk about is the next line which is a little more important.
