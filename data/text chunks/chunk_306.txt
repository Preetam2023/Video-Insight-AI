int n. We keep the value of int n as four. Now we print the percentage d. Here we will write power. First we will put the number n and then two. So if you look at this statement carefully, what have we done? R function is called, then the first parameter in the parens is its number n and the second parameter is whatever power you have to put above the number i.e. two, then this function will calculate n to the power 2 and give it back, which will be printed by our F, that is, our second library function will print it on the top of the screen. Now save this code once and run it. Here we have a warning generated. The warning says int but the argument type is double i.e. this number.What does this power function of ours do? It will give us a double value by returning it. If we look at it, we have the declaration statement of the power function. We have double, its return type is power, its name is and it takes two values, double and double.
