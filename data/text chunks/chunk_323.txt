? If we have to find the sum from n to n, then first find the sum from n to n minus and add A to it. So what will we do? Find the sum from n to n minus.If we take this, we will write it here as two a minus. This is a bit complex name, so here we will create a variable integer, sum of n minus 1. What we want to say is that this value indicates the sum of two a and we will store it inside this variable and where will it come from and will come from this sum function because if this sum function can find the sum of a values then it can definitely find n minus because now we will write the logic from here we will take n.Trust is a very big factor in the sum of recension.
