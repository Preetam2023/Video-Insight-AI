will be stored one after the other in the memory and all the data will go inside those three blocks. Now if we talk about the syntax of writing the array, if we want to create an integer type array, then first of all we will write the type int, after that we will write ourAfter that, we will write the name of the array in square brackets, then inside the square brackets, we write a number, that number is the size, that is, what size do we want the location, if we want three integer values, then we will write three, if we want five, then instead of this we can write 10, if we want 10, then we can write 100, then in this way we will create an integer array whose size is three. If we want to create a character array, then we will write character as the name of our array.Then square brackets and inside we will write how many characters we have to store in it. If we want to make a float, then we will name it in square brackets and inside we will write what should be the size.
