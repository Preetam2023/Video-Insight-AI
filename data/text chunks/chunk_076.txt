enjoying it, brother, I don t even know maths, which you have shown here by using a strange formula. I am not able to understand and what to do with coding from the beginning lecture, then what to do, here I am going to teach you that forInside the loop, we can put a restriction, pay attention to this thing here, like I was entering any number in place of n, it was getting printed accordingly, but let s do one thing, first of all, let s remove this n because what we have to do is that we don t need these three things, remove it, we just have to print this number, like if I write 34 here, I have to recognize it as 34. Okay, sometimes the Visual Studio code is a little bit tricky.I don t know, I will run it again and show that it is very normal. Our coder should be run here. I ran it till 34, then look, all my positive terms got printed. What was the problem here? Friend, I did not want to print it till 34, so what kind of work can I do here, so let me tell you something amazing.
