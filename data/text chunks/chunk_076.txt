the power of b, then how do we write b c? This expression is wrong, inside c we have power inside c.There is not a single operator for power, we have to use a function, inside which first we will put b, then we will put c, this will give us the value b to the power c, so if inside a we have to store the power of b to the power c, then we will be writing something like this, if we write this, then this value will be ours. Re will become wrong, this value will become correct. Let s see its example. Inside our code, int power e is equal to b s power c. Above we just have to include one more header file include method h. This method a is a header file, that is, there are already some things inside it which we can use. So the power which we are using the function has come from the method h itself. Now we have the power if we print it.
