have to define an array in its parameter. What is the format? First comes the function declaration. How will you declare such a function? Either you have written a normal function inside the argument, but inside the parameter you will write int array and then square brackets.Inside you do not need to give the size, meaning it can be of any size array, that is why for the size we will have to pass a separate integer n which will tell what is the size of the array or we can also pass it as a pointer. This is the method with square brackets and this is our method with points and both are correct. Here, int is the risk array, so it can be passed as a pointer also and inside the function call, you just have to write the name of the array, then we have toAlready know this is equal to m, but the array is of zero, so the value will be stored in this pointer, so the array itself is a pointer, it will be stored inside the pointer, so let s try it once, first of all, let s create a function, dec
