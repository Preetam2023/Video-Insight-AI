t of all we will learn how to show the output in C. After that we will learn how we take input in C. So to show the output, we just wrote a statement in C, that is print F and after that we put it. We write inside the parentheses, double quotes and inside the double quotes we can write anything. We had written on Hello World, here we can write, Hello Shraddha, here we can write.Hello our college, here we can write Hello C, anything can be written inside these double codes and which Whatever we write, it will be printed on the screen and the responsibility of getting this print printed is written by a function named Print F. Print F gets anything printed for us on the screen and at the end of this line, we will put semicolon to show that the line ends here. If you see its example, inside our code we can write print F here and in it we can write hello C. Let s save it as above.Let s blow away the extra space and run your code.
