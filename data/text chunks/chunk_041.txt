times. Okay, we know that the loop will run 100 times, but what is written inside, look at it once.So what is happening in this code, I will be able to tell only from one to 2, 3 till 10 because 100 will be too much but you understand what happened here in this code, first of all a box is created, then inside I, I write here like this, okay, the first value which was there, I am writing like this, became our one, consider it as a box, for now, the first condition to be seen is whether and is less than 100, just go inside and print whom.Well, whatever the value of a, print it, okay brother, so here we go, here we saw the output, brother, we printed the value of a, we printed the value of i only, which was one, okay and also printed a space, this is a space, so we printed a space also, okay brother, it is very correct, I am writing the space like an underscore, but it is not an underscore, it is a space.
