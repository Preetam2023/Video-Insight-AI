ue of that variable, store the value inside it and take it back.In this way, points are very useful. In our normal programming, I hope that the concept of points would have been clear to us to a great extent. We have covered all the basic concepts very easily.

Array is a structure of ours. About the array.We will be learning in the next chapter till then we will Or you can do some homework problems and ask questions, improve your skills and definitely revise the chapter so that we do not forget things. We have given notes for your convenience. And let s move towards our next chapter. Now we are going to start our chapter seven in which we will read about arrays.
