so clear yet, comment out this portion. Let s create a variable int aa inside which five is stored. Apart from that, we will create a pointer variable.Int Star PTR It is the address of A and we will create a point to pointer P PTR inside which we will store the address of PTR Now what to do is to get the things printed, normally a single thing, we will get it printed Which is Star Star P PTR Terminal compile and run So Star Star PPT R We got it printed and it got printed for us Five I hope its logic is clear that Star PTR means I will get the value.Will give the address of PTR and if star is converted to star PTR then it will give the value of the address stud on PTR i.e. it will give the value of five which we got printed and it was very simple to understand. Always keep in mind the two operators, where to use star when value is required and where to use em percent when address is required. We will be given here and there combination of both of these everywhere.
