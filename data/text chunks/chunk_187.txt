ll also dry run it. Okay, let s see what mistakes are coming, then agree.I will take the value of n. Take Lee Tooth 4 Okay so let s go to this code and reverse number my aa is zero for now look here zero is here as long as n is greater than zero of course n is greater than zero for now then aa aa p a modle 10 r equal to aa which is currently my aa what is zero so what is r e 0 plus n 1 2 3 4 modus 10 1 2 3 4Model 10 is 4. If you modify any number by 10 then it goes to the last digit then r 0 p 4 so one four is stored inside aa. Okay let s move ahead r 4 is 4. Now r 10 so it is also multiplied by 10 r so r becomes my 40 then ours comes n n which is 1 2 3 4 10 so1 2 3 Value of n is done 1 2 3 Okay brother, it is very good, let us do one thing, write the value of n and the value of r in separate lines, now n is 40 and this is 123, now we go back to the loop 1 2 3 What is the value of n, is it greater than zero, go exactly inside the loop r r n mud 10 so r eNow current r is mine 40 n mdl 1
