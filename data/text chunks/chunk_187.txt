in that case, the syntax of all three should be known. First of all, let s talk about the for loop. Now the syntax of the for loop is something like this.It happens in which first of all we write our keyword which is for, after that we put the parentheses and then these curly braces, like at the time of if, we had observed that there are some conditions, then our curly braces come and whatever work has to be done, we were writing in between. Something similar happens in the for loops. The first condition that comes in the for loop is the first condition that comes in the parentheses, we call this initialization.
