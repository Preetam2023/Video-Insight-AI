ice e equal to 100. Now this pointer which is making the price point, first we will use the pointer.We will print the original value, then the plus plus one and then the minus minus one. Then let s run the code. The original value was 904. As soon as we did plus plus, it increased by four bytes, four bytes of the float were added to it and as soon as we did minus minus, four bytes of the float were subtracted from it. In this way, the pointer also changes according to the size of the float. And if we take case three, then this is the case of our character. First of all.We created the character star, stored asteris inside it, after that created a pointer which is pointing to the star and then made PTR, so what is there in the character, there is one byte, the character is of only one byte, so whenever there is increment, it will actually be by one because one byte is incrementing, like here it is 2000, here it is 2001 and here it is 2002.
