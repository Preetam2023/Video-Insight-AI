ower B is the product. This power is fine, so here we write A B power C. The language is so strange.Let s run it and see, man, enter base2, enter power f 2 rate power 5 e 32, it s so good, my whole code is coming right, now there is a little limitation in it which we will see later but once let s see how it is running our code, let s dry run it so that we will dry run it very quickly and quickly, what can we say, we will finish it, okay, let s bring it back here and that s it, I am running the code.Okay, just look at this code, let s assume what I have taken, man, I have taken A and B, let s say I have taken F. Okay, let s write power 4. Let s write F. Now what I am doing is, first of all, from A to B. Okay, so I am running this loops five times. Okay, as many times as my power. I have taken a new variable named power. Okay, I have taken a new variable named power and one turn.
