factorial. What is the factorial of any number? Multiply that number by decreasing from one to one. Like if we calculate the factorial of one, then one exclamation mark in math is called one factorial, then it will be one. If we take 2 factorial, then it will be 1 ld ba 2. If we take 3 factorial, then it will be.Will be 1 2 3 6 This will be 2 4 Factorial will be 1 m 2 3 4 24 5 Factorial will be 1 2 3 4 5 120 So this is how our factorials are calculated Now the multiplication here is either we can multiply from one to five or we can multiply from five to one MultiplyBy dividing one number with another number, the same output is obtained, that is, a b also remains the same, b a also remains the same, and the plus also remains the same. If there is no same in the minus and divide, then if we want to find the factorial of any number, then simply put a loop for it. Where should the loop start? Let it start from our number itself. Int should start from i 1 and go till n.
