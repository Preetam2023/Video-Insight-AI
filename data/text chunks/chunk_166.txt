is equal to 0 and let s write a little here and there and inside this we have put the value of zero. Okay, now it is written here, keep running the loop until n is equal to 0, so see what is happening by running the loop, first of all n isThe value is 1 2 3 4 So n n 10 So its value becomes 1 2 3 As soon as this happened, we had to keep one more thing in mind here, we write the count in the same way, right now, the value of the count is zero for us, as soon as this happens, put a plus in the count, then the count is equal to count P 1, so we put one in the count, then next here in the count.We put one and then looked at the loop again. If n is 1 2 3 then 1 2 3 is not equal to zero. So run the loop. It is not over yet. Go back and divide by 10 and add. So it becomes 12 and add one more to your count. Okay then see if 12 is equal to zero. No come inside then divide by 10. One is here. Then look here add one more count and add three. Then see is one zero?Otherwise divide it by 10.
