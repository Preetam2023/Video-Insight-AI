printed, Thursday was also printed, Friday was also printed, Saturday was also printed, Sunday was also printed and after that not.A valid day is also printed i.e. all the switches after that have turned on, that is why break is useful for us because we do not have to turn on all the switches, we have to turn on only one switch, like when it becomes on, you go out from here, hence whenever you write switch, it is very important to apply break. Now let s check the default once, if we enter, let s say 19, then 19 is not a valid day, it will be printed for us, so in this way ourWhatever the switch is, it works. Now for the same code, we can also play with the characters like this day, we have made it not of integer type, let us make it of character type and for Monday we will have M, for Tuesday we will have T, for Wednesday we will have small W, for Thursday we will keep capital T, for Friday we will keep F, for Saturday we will keep small S and for Sunday we will take capital S.
