ons in which we can describe different functions.You must be looking at their properties by writing. The first question in this is Right to Fun. In question one to print hello and second to print good bye. In the question we have to write two functions. First of all we will create a function which prints hello, then we will create a function which prints good bye. So let s cross it. We have already created a function print hello which prints hello. Now what will we do? We will create a function which will print good bye. So above first we have to tell the compiler void print good bye. We are going to create a function.After we told the compiler, we actually make that function void print good bye and here we will write the print statement good bye. So we created a function named print hello. We created a function named print good bye. Inside the hello we are printing hello. Inside the good bye we are printing good bye. We have mentioned the prototype of both the functions above.
