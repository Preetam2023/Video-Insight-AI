o us. We call this concept call by value, which means we pass the value of our argument as argument.If we are calling our function, then its definition is that when we pass the value of variable as argument, so all the functions we have written till now were call by value, but if we have to pass the variable, then we can also call by reference. How to call by reference? When we pass the address of the variable as an argument, let s take an example of this, let s create another function which we will name.Underscore Squa This is our new square function, inside this also we will have an integer JAR A Void Underscore Squa Int n Now what we will do here is write int star n because we are going to take a pointer here, if we send the address then there should have been a pointer variable to receive the address and here we will write the same thing star n star n star n and here also we will write star n so this is a square function which takes the pointer.
