oop. It will go from row to 10 and after doing all the multiplications it will get the table stored. Which number s number here, we passed two first.After that, first of all two which will be multiplied with i 1 because we have done zero base indexing so the value of i is zero so first of all it will give us the value two then four then six then eight then 10 and so on. So all these values will be stored one by one in the array of tables in our array in which our row will remain constant because we have passed constant n. The column on the row will keep changing so first of all.The value which will be there will be array of 00, then there will be array of 01, then there will be array of 02, then there will be array of 03 and so on, so in this way our value will keep changing in which our zero which is there will remain constant, when we pass zero to n and if n is passed one then we will have one everywhere.
