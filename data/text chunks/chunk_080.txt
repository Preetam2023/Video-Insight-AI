check here one thing that I forgot to tell you before running the loop, we are not inside the loop.First of all, I made a box, then we checked, is a greater than 0, is 100 greater than zero, of course, go ahead, brother, you do all these things, printed it, then increased the value of a to 97, then came back here, then increased the value of i, sorry i P, then increased the value of i, so we increased the value of i to two, then we came back in the loop, we saw that this thing has already happened once, what from 97 to zero.It has increased, go ahead, print 97 same value, reduce it to 94, brother, so here it is done, 94.
