ow the module operator which is there does not work on our float values like if we write here 1.6 1.0 and after saving it if we want to run then it will not run because there are invalid operands. Our operand is 1.6 and the other operand is 1.0 so the module operator which is there only works on integer values whenever there is an integer value.When we divide 1 by an integer, it returns to us an integer. Reminder value. Now there are two cases in integer also either our enumeration can be positive or our enumeration can be negative. Whenever our enumeration is positive then the reminder that comes to us is also a positive reminder but when our enumeration is negative then our reminder also.
