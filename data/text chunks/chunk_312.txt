Well, a small thing which can seem quite interesting. If any work in programming is done with loops.If it is possible then that work can also be done by recursion and the work which can be done by recursion can also be done by loop but the difference is that the work which sometimes requires us to write a lot of lines to do it through loop can be done in two three lines by recursion and the work which sometimes requires writing a lot of lines to do it by recursion can be done in a few lines by loop so we have to see where items i.e. loops will be used and where else.Recount will be used, so first of all, to see the example of recursion, we print Hello World five times. There is a function which gives us print Hello World. Its name is void print hello world and inside this we pass a parameter which will tell how many times we print it. We can also call it count. Int count.
