is n size of memory. So pt01 n till i end every time we will be printing the percentage d ptr of aa. So we need memory of four sizes. So these four integers have been allocated to us and by default zero is stored inside each integer. Next let us see that free is also a most important function.Now what happens inside them is that the dynamic memory allocated by Calc Mall is not automatically free. Let us understand this thing in a little depth. We wrote a program inside it, we created an integer n and apart from that we used n in between and then later on that means this is a very long program. It has thousands of lines and the integer n is used only in the first line and in the second line. So the compiler of C is smart, it will see what it will do later.If it is not being used, then it will free n because it has seen that n is statically allocated, that is, the memory was allocated in the beginning itself and it knows that the C compiler knows what is going to happen with this memory.
