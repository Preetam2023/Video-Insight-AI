the condition statements very well where your code can get stuck. So let s move inside the question. First of all, we have to check whether our number is odd. What will we do to check the odd? If not equal to 0 then it means our number is odd. So here we will write our condition. What to do inside the condition. If it is odd then we will print it as percentage d n i otherwise else.What is to be done inside Else? There is no need to write Else inside Else because there is no need to do anything inside Else. We save it and run it from our terminal. The output we get is 5 7 9 11 and you will observe carefully. These are all odd numbers which exist between 5 to 50, so we can write the code in this way also. The next question saysPrint the factorial of a number n i.e. there is a number n. We have to print its factorial. First of all, let s talk about what is the thing called factorial. What is the factorial of any number? Multiply that number by decreasing from one to one.
