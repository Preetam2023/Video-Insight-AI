, so it will become zero, okay, our power has become one, and now we have to run the loop loop here.Friend, how many times will it run, it is a simple thing, as many times as I have to multiply the number, I told you the theory, how it happens, then you can say for int i 1 i b because b is my power, so many times, if I run my loop and write that product again and again, what should I put in product, product i is equal to product, where did I go, ok, I am writing product, I am so sorry power was my variable then power i is equal to two.I am multiplying the power into A by A. I repeat the power again and again and print the power in the last check. It is possible that I have made a small mistake here, but you will understand the overall logic of the code. Okay, now I print F directly. Can we write here? Our first number was A, so write here A is the raise to the power B is the product. This power is fine, so here we write A B power C. The language is so strange.
