s first look at it with an example because if we look at this statement, we will see the complexity. What do we do? First of all, let s create a function and name it Print Price. What does this function do? You can also name it just Calculate Price. It will take the price of any item, add GST on it at 18 and then get that value printed. So, let s keep the return type of this function as void, we give it a name.Calculate price and there will be some value coming inside it, int value. Now let s write the definition of this function void calculate price, there will be some value coming inside it, int value. Now what will it do to the value itself, value plus in fact, let s make this integer value a float. Why float because there will be a decimal value on 18, most probably, so it will be easy for us, it will make the value value plus 0.18.
