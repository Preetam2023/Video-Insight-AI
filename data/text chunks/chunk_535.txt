be printed, that is, we will subtract the Esc of the second string from the Esc of the first string. Whenever our letters are different, that is why whenever the first string is bigger, if the second string is smaller, then a positive value will be printed and vice versa, i.e. if the first string is smaller, if the second string is bigger, then we will have a negative value printed. Let us see an example of this.are as if Lee is string, we have L and second string, we have banana, so in first a will be equal to 65, b will be equal to 66, so 65 66 will give us negative 1, so since this is a negative value, then we will know from string comparison that our first string is shorter than our second string. Make sure to verify all these once with code key, then we learn any concept in programming.Always verifying should not happen that we have just read the theory theory and we have not tried its code.
